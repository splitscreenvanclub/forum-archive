I think the cream and Brown checked cloth work a little better and now I have added a dash of red, in the wheels and the curtain when fitted are red checked.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t473/DrDetail1/photo5-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t473/DrDetail1/photo4-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t473/DrDetail1/photo3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1061.photobucket.com/albums/t473/DrDetail1/photo11.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I have recently fitted a straight axle kit with the help of some friends and hope to fit safari windows before the summer. then i'll turn my attention to my Beetle.",
