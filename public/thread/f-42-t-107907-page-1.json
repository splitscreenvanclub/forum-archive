I want to sell my Campervan using the draft Ad document that I created and comes in 3 formats, Word / PDF / jpg all with pictures and 9 pages long. \n<br>As I have been unable to upload these files to the forum above, is there anyone out there that can help me get this sale moving.\n<br>I am a absolute beginner on this site and have never use these forums before now.\n<br>I can be contacted by email: \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:rgbargee@btinternet.com\">rgbargee@btinternet.com</a>\n<!-- e --> \n<br>The following is the text from the 1st page of the ad document:\n<br>\n<br>A 1967 VW RHD Walkthrough Devon/Dormobile Campervan for sale \n<br>I bought this Bus 23 years ago with the Paintwork as seen (except for the Grey and rusty primer bits), and it has been a labour of Luv ever since.\n<br> I had a 1964 and a 1966 Beetle which I sold on.\n<br>I’ve now decided the time has \n<br>come for me to give up on this restoration project as I’m not getting any younger. \n<br>So up for grabs is my 2nd Luv; for those who want a 100% original Bus that is now a 48yr old classic that still needs a little more TLC for it to survive for another 23 years.\n<br>\n<br>I've tried to upload the ads 1st page as an attachment but the file is to large; Help.",
