Begs the question wtf?!! Unfortunately we have to have one to get insurance as our early bay was also stolen 6 years ago, sadly never found. We've not actually seen Will's yet but have seen photos police took &amp; appears to be very little damage thank god. It is in the police pound now for forensic to go over it but we've been told that even if the do get who took him it'll only be a slap on the wrist! They'd only be able to charge with twoc as no damage to vehicle. Makes me so angry!!!! The ******* get away with it to go on &amp; do it again!!!!!!!!!!\n<br>\n<br>Next thing is to try &amp; find additional security measures. Wheel clamp, additional alarm &amp; upgrade immobiliser amongst other things.",
