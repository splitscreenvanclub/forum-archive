You could order an ambulance from VW GB in 1955. Maybe the order was placed in March and the conversion time for a RHD ambulance took a number of months. I can confirm that it was registered in Partick, Scotland in Aug '55. I shall add the pic to the 'evidence' section rather than the 'survivors' section.\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>I can confirm this bus has survived.... It is languishing in a garage in the UK soon to be returned to the road. Believe the Chassis number to be 20-085541 It is a RHD ambulance and as said above is believed to be first registered in Scotland. Appears to be the only RHD 54 ambulance known looking at barndoor.dk\n<br>I won't share any photos until the owner has ok'd it. But let's hope he can return it to the road soon.",
