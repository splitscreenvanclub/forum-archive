Has anyone had any experience of making them? I've see the high gloss formica but is that easy or hard to work with? Is there a better product to use?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Florence",

Avoid the cheap MDF from the likes of B&amp;Q etc it's not much better than cardboard!\n<br>We make bedroom, bathroom and all sorts of cabinet doors and get them finished by a local company. The 'super high gloss' is the most expensive finish-he charges Â£90 per sq mt, but it is a fantastic mirror finish",
