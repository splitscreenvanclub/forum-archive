I took a look at work but couldn't see anything, but found out today what it was while using Chrome (as you were by the looks of it). \n<br> \n<br>Tridau's avatar image is hosted by freewebtown which redirects to \"fwt.txdnl.com\". Google have obviously found malware hosted on that domain, hence the warning. No threat to forum users unless they rummage round the fwt.txdnl.com site. \n<br> \n<br>Thanks for reporting it. \n<br> \n<br>John",
