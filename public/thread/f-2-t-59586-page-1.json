Its best described as like driving on boat on the road with far less room, one of the first things I did was fit the CE rack. Now it may not be perfect (lets be honest what is?) but having now driven up to the Lake District and back (in some appalling weather where at one point everything on the road slowed to my speed) and down to Cornwall/Devon with some very narrow roads/streets, I think its the best mod I have done so far. It will never be as good as my previous motors (VR6, R32) but now I love driving it and its stopped ageing me.",

    "content" : "I have a creative rack and must admit im a little indifferent to what difference if any it has made. When my bus was restored i had an essentially brand new steering box, with NOS worm etc fitted ... and in all honesty when the rack was fitted i haven't really noticed a great deal of difference, it is heavy at parking speed but this isnt a major concern and certainly isnt too heavy. Dave at creative is apparently developing a power steering kit too although no idea how much this will be and when it will be ready. As mentioned above i do feel that it is a little under engineered. The oversight of the horn push although small is irritating and something that clearly should be addressed. As also mentioned the use of old parts in the steering setup doesn't really appear to do away with the old technology . With the current trend for racks inevitably others will learn from mistakes and improve. There does seem to be more and more coming to the market. Mark Hopleys setup looks interesting, are these on sale yet? anyone had one fitted?",
