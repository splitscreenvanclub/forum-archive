Can this inconsistency be explained ?\n<br>Also the front seat is a 1/3rd 2/3rd whereas I'm let to believe that pre 63 should be a bench seat - any thoughts ?\n<br>Once I've ascertained the age if the van I'd like to reinstate the the interior so need to know whether to put a bench seat I or should I stick with what I've got.\n<br>Thanks in advance.",
