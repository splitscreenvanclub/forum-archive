Anyway at least I now have two the same, my new bearing covers arrived as well so decided to finish building up the rear end after being sat for two week, now ready to bolt on I think!! Also decided to change the lower Spring in the brakes, back to how it was originally with two smaller springs",

    "content" : "I think early US spec buses upto 63(with sigla laminated glass) should sit in the metal runner that then sits in the bottom felt, the glass does not sit directly in the bottom felt like the securit. It's not the glass thickness, it's the repro bottom felt thickness that's the problem. When building up and setting the bottom channel, The glass gets trapped and won't slide, I've had to shave the bottom of the felt off before glueing in the channel(around 3/4 mm) to leave enough room for the glass to slide. I checked it against an original piece I had, and the bottom part of the felt was twice the thickness on the repro\n<br>\n<br>Hope that makes sense!!\n<br>\n<br>Rick",
