    "content" : "One of the things I hate the most about modern cars is all the electric gadgetry and the stupid dash warning lights that go with it all. \n<br> Had an ABS light come up on Mrs E's car. Checked it and it wasn't the actual ABS but the sensor on the wheel. Which some dumb ****er at Ford thought would be best positioned in the NSF wheel where it can get clogged up with all the dead hedgehogs and leaves in the gutter. To get to it you have to strip down the hub and trash the bearing. Can't remember the exact cost but think it was about £180 all in. \n<br> My to-and-from-work hack (worth not much) has had the engine management light on or the last few months. It runs no different and I know the fault code is for the sensor in the top of the manifold. That I've already replaced. It used to come on and go off randomly making no difference to the wad the car runs at all. I had to put it out but if it don't go out by itself after a week or so but this time it's been on for a while so I've just left it. I know there is nothin wrong with the emissions because I've checked them, it's just this stupid light. \n<br> Father-in-Laws car has suddenly got the traction control warning light come up. He didn't even know what traction control was let alone what the little picture was. You can actually turn the traction control off manually if you want, but if the light indicates a fault you can't put the light out. Now not could be a sensor or it could be to whole pump (at an eye watering (£1800 to have replaced). Again, it makes no difference to the car drives unless you're Stirling Moss (in which case you probably wouldn't have bought a Focus anyway). So for something that you don't need and can turn off anyway it could cost half the value of the car to fix. What a load of old b*****ks. \n<br> \n<br> And guess what.....it's now an MOT fail if any dash warning lights are illuminated regardless whether it's just the warning light that's faulty of the actual item it refers to. \n<br> Modern cars and electric gadgets = rip off sh!t designed for morons who can't drive and to make main stealers a load more cash on top of their rip-off charges. \n<br> Shame you can't just buy a decent bug for a grand any more and use that as a daily....\n<br> \n<br> And breathe.....",

Straight away it gave the fault and he knew exactly what it was as he did one last week. \n<br> I've been doing a bit of research in the mean time and it appears that it's a common fault with Ford and VW that the control module goes in the ABS/TCS system. If you google it you'll come up with loads of threads of different forums about the 60-series modules failing. Guess what our car has? Yup exactly that. Previously the only way to fix it was to change the whole lot including the pump at an eye-watering £1300 \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> for the unit plus a couple of hours labour. Thankfully you can now buy the control module on its own (still not exactly cheap considering they must know it's a common fault). \n<br> So at least I now knew what it is. And how much it's gonna cost \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> Basically it gonna be £400 supplied and fitted for a genuine ford part (that I hope lasts longer than the 43k miles the last one has been on there) inc vat. \n<br> So I've got half a result as it could've been 1300 quid plus. \n<br> I'll update when it's done. \n<br> The p!sser is that if it was a Traction Control System fault it wouldn't fail the MOT but because it's Electonic Stability Control, which is basically an updated version of traction control, it's an MOT fail under the new guidelines from Oct 2016. What really boils my p!ss though is that I can get into the car and manually switch off the Stability Control so it's not like you even need it in the first place. Plus it's not like every car manufactured has it fitted in the first place and I've managed to drive more than adequately for 30 years in a variety of different cars, none of which had the stupid stability control fitted. \n<br> I hate all this electronic rubbish you get on modern cars with a passion as it just seems another way to bleed us dry when they go wrong grrrrr \n<br> \n<br> Cheers, Lee.",
