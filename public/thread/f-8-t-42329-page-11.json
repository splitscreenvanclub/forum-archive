And you can be sure that your construction is far more stiff and rigid than the original VW solution as closed profiles are always stronger than open ones.\n<br>\n<br>You wonÂ´t have any problems with structural weaknesses of early sambas as you will have to replace your roof rims, reinforcements and gutters as well due to the severe rust damages. I can recommend those parts made of 2 mm sheet steel for additional strenght around the roof frame.\n<br>\n<br>Keep it going!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Jurgen",

    "content" : "Right, my rear end as promised \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/bootyshake.gif\" alt=\":bootyshake:\" title=\"bootyshake\"> \n<br>\n<br>First thing I thought about was the clearance for the swing arms. Would love to avoid a cutout in the rear rails if possible. Lots of talk about how they effect safety but the main reason, they just don't look factory. \n<br>\n<br>Fitted up some beetle swing arms to some bolt on clamps and checked if I would be able to fit a wheel without a notch. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/4bcc4484.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/59a371d7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>There is a bit of rust damage in the pics but the rail was pretty good and complete enough to clearly see that I wouldn't need a notch \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>Don't forget the rail is already 45mm higher then standard due to the chassis raise. \n<br>\n<br>On a side note. There is NO reason on a barndoor to not consider IRS when thinking straight axle. With the bolt on clamps a complete beetle setup will bolt in with no mods needed at all !\n<br>\n<br>Having said all that. I'll be opting for some late bay swing arms. They will need to be shortened for the barndoor. If you shorten bay swing arms it brings the mount backwards so you have to use the latter bay ones with the less sharp curve (and their cheaper \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">). The reason for the bay arms is that Beetle arms are more subject to camber issues on big drops. Also they are narrower than beetle arms so will give a tiny bit more raise before they hit the rear rail. And I have a special plan for mounting the hub carrier. \n<br>\n<br>It should also be noted that barndoors, especially the early ones are built to be slammed. The tostion bar ends are turned up to give more drop. The shape of the gearbox cradle means that there is no trimming needed for the swing arms. And the thin flat (on pre 53) bottom of the cradle gives excellent ground clearance.\n<br>\n<br>As stock the torsion bar ends do sit 20mm lower then the frame rails. But after much calculation a 20mm torsion bar raise was to much. So a 10mm raise is all it gets. The very bottom of the torsion bar ends (yes I do want to keep them) will see a little filling down. \n<br>\n<br>Now I only had one rear rail. The other had dissolved \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> so I had to fab one up rather than modify the originals. So custom rails were the order of the day yet again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>These took ALOT of thought. The problem was as original but 45mm higher they would be raising the floor thingy that sits between the rear wheel arches and subsequently needing the firewall cut and the engine surrounds altered. This I wanted to avoid. Im after everything (except the obvious front wheel wells) to be stock looking from inside. So the options were to lower the curve, but then the swing arms wouldn't clear (they only just did), or skim the top off. In other words thin the rail. Too much would be sketchy, so after a million drawings and a hole day staring at sketches. This is what I came up with \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/e5919e0b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/0e752322.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/fd8d1d14.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The thin one makes it. Exactly the same lower arch curve as an original rail. The top edge sits closer to the torstion bar ( right on it infact) the top curve edge is ever so lightly higher the an original standard height rail would be \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>Notice also how the end flat section at the rear has been stepped back down to stock height just like the front frame rail was. So that the rear valance, engine lid and tinware are all factory looking when you open the back up. There will be an unnoticeable slightly steeper slope in the rear engine surround that's all \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Turn the card into metal\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/5cafd935.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I cut the outside skin out of 3mm steel and the inside skin i ran the full length of the rail for more strength. The inside skin is also 15mm wider to act as the pinch weld/fold that's under the original rails. It doesnt effect the swing arm clearance due to the angle they come up at. The rails were then box sectioned and also had square crossbraces welded inside. So although slightly narrower on the top curve (all the rest is factory diameters) its far more strong. I could twist the original a little if I rearly tried. No chance with my box sectioned rails. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/903907ea.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/f1f729d2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn151/robjcopeland/cebdfa52.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

    "content" : "Next up, fitting the rear rails. The 10mm torsion bar raise means that the gearbox cradle touches the ground exactly as the centre rails do \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>One thing to look out for. Although marks diagram is priceless and I'll be eternally indebted.

But I took it as gospel, everything else was. \n<br>\n<br>The radius of the torsion tube is not 5cm. The torsion tube is 9cm.

I was able to sort it on the rear rail as it was only the top bit of hole I was using. Luckily I discovered it when I had only done one side of the 4 needed on the centre chassis rails.

Measure the gap between the rear rails. Now I didn't have this measurement so I had just said sod it and carried on. But every measurement from the pie cut weld back would eventually effect this measurement. Well I got one off a 63 panel (cheers Scott) and it was 1005mm. Roughly a meter, wonder if they planned that \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>Measured mine.

I don't have the facilities to mount a shell. I did look at a winch system but the rafters arnt really strong enough. All it needs now are the front cross brace and inner valance welded on. The bottoms of the pillars fixing up on the shell and then welding onto the inner sills. The side supports and a pair of sills and it should resemble a van again. All be it without a front and still in need of some serious work \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>But atleast It should roll around with a box and beam bolted in. \n<br>\n<br>As for mods. The chassis should now mount into the shell and that be repaired without ANY more custom mods required.
