    "content" : "Yesterday's job was the easy bit (or so I thought). Get tyres mounted and pop the wheels on \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>Let me just cut to the chase and offer a piece of advice to anyone swapping to steels. Get yourself some tyre valves IN ADVANCE! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Bus steel wheels have an oversized valve whole and the standard valves all the fitters stock pull straight through...\n<br>\n<br>So my fitter sent me on a hunt for some valves and I must have tried a dozen tyre fitters who all failed to come up with suitable valves. An hour and a half later, i had a brainwave and called in at Aircooled Engineering in Tyseley, Birmingham to ask for some advice. Mike there said a particular fitter they have used had ordered some in specially for a ghia they had and had a bag full... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> Quick visit and Â£10 for 5 stubby wide-base valves and I'm heading back triumphantly to my fitter who's got all my wheels and tyres.\n<br>\n<br>Tyres fitted I headed home for the changeover. I'd forgotten what a palaver this is with a lowered bus (no adjustable springplates here). I also had to swap out the studs on my CSP front discs to suit the wheel nuts as the alloy nuts were 12mm and the new ones 14mm.\n<br>\n<br>So anyway, a pic or two of the results of my labours...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>They state of the tyres after the fitter had finished \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/1c0385d052920c39e47aa707976672e5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>And finally in place...\n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/9aa25f3512fcd74b1caf75eb0d4bca1a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/9981f6d72a76ae2932863449d1f5d648.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/1598de0f286fccf2ca035381cac795d5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>See y'all at Vicky Farm!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Nige \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
