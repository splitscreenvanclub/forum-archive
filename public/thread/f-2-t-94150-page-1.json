    "content" : "Hi there,\n<br>\n<br>Well it looks like I've finally got the missus on side. She has at last relented and said that yes, we can get a van. I've really got a soft spot for Splits so I'm after some inspiration. How do I go about getting 2 adults and 2 kids (6 and 9) on beds/bunks in a solid roof/non pop top split? The best idea I've had is a Devon/Pitt style bed for the adults and a cab bunk and a similar bunk across the rear boot area. I plan on having no wardrobe or high level units in the rear.\n<br>If anyone has any other ideas, or if you squeeze this many people in a Split to sleep please let me know!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Scotty",

I reackon I'll need an awning or pop-up/day tent next to the van for all the 'stuff' like outside chairs, outdoor table etc. \n<br>Another reason for asking this question is my intergral garage is a tad on the small side. A solid roof van will fit only if its been lowered a touch. Good excuse I reckon!\n<br>\n<br>Any more ideas or camping set-ups are most welcome, always searching for inspiration.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Scotty",

I hang my front pole off some wire rope tied to the safaris but you can fix the brackets supplied, you just need to angle them down the length of the pillar (I've not done it, but I have seen it).\n<br>\n<br>Here's our 2 boys in there while 3 and 1, we continued with that until last year when they were pretty much kicking the crap out of each other all night, and now the eldest sleeps on a blow up airbed behind the bulkhead (we can take the seat out and put it in the awning). We now have another on the way so I'm going to move to a devon/ pitt style interior and go back to 2 in the cab bunk and one over the engine bay, plenty of room \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s21.photobucket.com/user/orangebus/media/IMG_0861_zps9f699baa.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b257/orangebus/IMG_0861_zps9f699baa.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>When they get older, I suspect they'll move into the awning (or I will more than likely!). My daughter (16) also comes away with us from time to time and she sleeps in there now, although I'm having to rethink the configuration inside to get all the bloody seatbelts in...\n<br>\n<br>I'm not sure I could put a pop top in mine, but I could happily buy one done already, it does make sense if you missed biology at school and keep having kids \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

Second night I had one on the cushion over the engine compartment and one in the front hammock over the front cab and they slept fine and we ended up using the bunk beds as storage holders! and to be honest the whole pop top roof thing put us right off when we looked for our own van, on one windy night the van was shaking like crazy so had to put it down so it would have been a mare if the kids hadn't had the other positions. \n<br>\n<br>So when I bought my tin top split I was lucky enough to find a 64 Devon interior to go in it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>We also have a tin top Early Bay which has a Westfalia Interior with Rock N Roll bed, I'm not going to lie.. its super comfortable and a really good lay out but its only good as a three birth with the pop top, we have a Westy hammock/Cot and when the kids where younger both slept together in it tops and tails.. but they are that bit older now and camping at Stanford was a nightmare and we ended up having one in the bed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> So The Bay is no up for sale and I'm going to concentrate on getting the Devon Split finished!",
