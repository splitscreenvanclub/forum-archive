    "content" : "Right, thought this was the best place to stick this thread. From the start let me say I am an engine building novice! So ALL advice, no matter how obvious you think it may be, is appreciated. My experience to date has been a 1500 build way back in '95. I've since forgotten nearly everything I learned back then so I'm starting from scratch here.\n<br> I'm hoping to find out what things I can do myself, what things need to be done by experts, good reference material, right tools for the job, how to tell if parts are worn out, best place for parts.... \n<br> \n<br> Right, first step, try and work out what went wrong with the motor!\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=47509&amp;hilit=heart\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=47509&amp;hilit=heart</a>\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Engine was running OK, but had endfloat and used oil. It did 30mpg on good days, and was statically timed to 7.5tdc using a test light off the coil. Regularly did long motorway runs at 50mph, sometimes more. (shouldn't really go over 48mph)\n<br> Lost power suddenly on the way back from the Brighton Breeze, pulled over a couple of miles later and conked out on hard shoulder.\n<br> \n<br> Quick compression test while stripping down showed no compression in No1 cylinder...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Brighton%2008/PA190005.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Brighton%2008/PA190004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Brighton%2008/PA190010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Brighton%2008/PA190009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Engine is now on the workbench while I strip it down, and when I get a chance I'm going to post sources and prices for all the bits I thnk I'll need.

    "content" : "Nice one Mike,\n<br> \n<br> I would suspect the damage may be just localised to that piston a cylinder then.\n<br> I would still go for a complete tear down though, the first 30 hp in my 52 ran fine but had low oil pressure till the big end bearing picked up and span.\n<br> \n<br> Im sure you have it but here is a link for lots of 30 (36)hp main and rod bearings , valves , oil pump etc.\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www2.cip1.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=36hp\" class=\"postlink\">http://www2.cip1.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=36hp</a>\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\n<br> \n<br> I have not looked to see if they do a slight oversize flywheel bearing for 36hp , the one you need to machine out for end float correction. I had found that the slight endfloat on the old 52 engine had caused the rear std bearing to rock in the case, hopefully you will be lucky.\n<br> \n<br> If it does need machining or you align bore it too do post up where you get it done and costs etc as i have unknown engine for the kempes that i may just rebuild anyway.\n<br> \n<br> The crack if tiny would probably only effect the engine when it was flat out and not be noticable or effect it much when just running about. I have a spare inlet if you need it.\n<br> \n<br> Good luck , keep us posted. Lots of pictures.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> Mark",

I'm going to try and sit down over the weekend and compare all the prices. Not easy when you have to guess shipping on top for overseas.

    "content" : "Mike,\n<br> \n<br> Im sure when i looked at doing a \"quick\" rebuild on the old 52 engine , with the crank grind and parts it was still a few hundred pounds.\n<br> I did what alot of people do and picked up a another engine which by chance runs absolutely great, it could have done 10k miles or it may have done 100k i just dont know but it was alot cheaper than fixing it. new set of seals all over and a dam good service and like you im 4000 miles and still all is well and it purs along.\n<br> \n<br> Is the engine on your van original? If it is then the cost of rebuilding may well be a good long term investment both for van value and for reliability.\n<br> \n<br> If its not is it worth chancing and just changing the piston and barrel.\n<br> When the engine stopped was it making any loud banging or knocking noises?\n<br> \n<br> The problem is when you open it up it all depends on budget, you could spend a fortune and rebuild everything or you could just change major parts and have a regrind to have the engine destroyed by something that you didnt change - like a faulty inlet manifold that you would never ever consider could be a problem.\n<br> If you get into machining, align bore's and fixing end float problems then it may be alot more money than you think especially with 30hp.\n<br> \n<br> Im in the same boat as you soon, i never know what to do for the best as the costs can spiral and second hand engines are allways available. \n<br> But like i say if it is the original one then it may well be worth the money.\n<br> Keep us posted with your thoughts and the plan.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> mark",

    "content" : "Good questions Mark! I've got maybe £250 in my head for a rebuild, which as I dig further doesn't look like it'll go far at all.... Maybe for a stock 12v 1600, but not for a 30hp.\n<br> \n<br> I doubt the engine is original to the Kombi. For a start it's different to the Birth Certificate! Although how VW in Germany knows what engines went into CKD's I'm not sure? But anyway, it's a dustbowl Aussie Kombi, and they are notorious for going though engines due to the conditions. My attachment to the motor is just because it's been pretty good to me for the last 11,000 miles, plus I'm curious about doing an engine rebuild. Of course my wallet, and lack of budget, is also a big deciding factor on this... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> \n<br> \n<br> Deano, as always you are a star, this will be an expensive Jägermeister bill... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/drunken_smilie.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"27\" alt=\":drunken:\" title=\"drunken\">",
