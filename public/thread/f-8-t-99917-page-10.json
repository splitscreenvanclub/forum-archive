    "content" : "Once we had the van on the car ramps we could see a couple of problems with the planned mounting position, it was going to be difficult to drill through the floor and be able to get the bracket bolted up, it must be something to do with our van being a walkthrough and RHD, but after a little bit of head scratching we decided to add a small amount of square tube to the mount.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/DSCF4930.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/DSCF4930.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>This gave us more room to get to the brake pipe outlets and gave us room to get to the bolts, it lowered the servo unit enough to still give clearance so nothing touches, once securely mounted we started to plan the route for the additional brake pipes.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/DSCF4936.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/DSCF4936.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>The master cylinder pipes were mocked up and then made by a local motor factor, using the correct fittings supplied in the kit, the vaccum hose was attached and routed through the chassis and along the rail sides.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/DSCF4936.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/DSCF4936.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>A couple of options for blanking off the spare master cylinder outlet, make one up from a brake pipe fitting, insert a bolt and weld in place, or fill another brake light switch, this was our option as we had a spare one.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/DSCF4938.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/DSCF4938.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>At the enging end we had a manifold bend with a servo outlet pipe already in place, this was from a bay van we had in the past so was an easy fit, we routed the pipe over the gearbox and drilled a hole in the engine bay to route it through, once fitted we started the engine and checked for leaks.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/DSCF4941.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/DSCF4941.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>We have yet to test it out and bleed the system but will post up the result soon.",
