The gas outlets are a 2 5/8\" hoses going forward over the fan and looping out of sight under the base plates. Its been running this setup since before we saw you in Ashbourne. It goes well and everything is dry as a bone in there. when the engine ages a bit I'll add the rocker vents.",

    "content" : "Well poor old Rita has been laid up for a few months since alternator number 4 went pop after Viccy Farm.\n<br>\n<br>Fortunately, good ole Peter Good came to the rescue and diagnosed that the diode I was using to stop the engine running on was killing the trio diodes after about 500miles each. He's now rebuilt my original Bosch Alternator and I've got to say its a much better fit than the chinese copies. I've also treated it to a Saco Performance pulley which is a thing of beauty. Much better than any of the VW Brazil ones I've been running.\n<br>\n<br>Next on the agenda is fixing the misfire/stalling which has plagued the van from day 1. Its all caused by HT interference on the cam sensor. This is a bit of a bodge, but I've just turned off the sequential injection (where it fires down each port in sync with the inlet valve opening) and gone back to the simpler batched injection (where all the injectors fire at the same time). Its not as efficienct in theory but its blinkin luverly to drive now. Idles as smooth as you like and even with the FK8 cam it pulls strongly and smoothly from 1500rpm. I'll look into the interference issue a bit more soon, the latest DTA firmware upgrade has a few new features to mask off interference so I'll try them at my leisure.\n<br>\n<br>Taking of leisure. I got a new voltage sensitive relay block from Antares. Its a bit butch, but basically it connects to the +ve terminal of the two batteries and a small wire to ground and measures which battery is being charged at any time so it charges the leisure battery off the alternator or charges the van battery if the leisure side is plugged into mains hook up. Simples.\n<br>\n<br>Finally I've designed a detent system for the gearshift on the 901 box. Its got a couple of spring plungers acting on the sides of a bobbin attached the the shift rod. It's totally transformed the van. If anyone else is suffering with a porsche gearbo just get in touch and I can send you the drawings but it looks like this...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P1000281.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P1000282.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>A network first ...
