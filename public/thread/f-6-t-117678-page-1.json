    "content" : "I have an aftermarket fuel tank in my bus.but it's not a very good fit, to be honest it's .... ! When it was sat in the bus it was sat on pieces of wood to get the neck to clear the wheel arch, and at the filling point it sat too high, which meant the rubber seal sat too high creating a large gap in the plate hole at the bottom. I had to fight with the whole lot just to remove it from my bus. I know you can get 2 priced tanks which are aftermarket, do any of them fit properly. Or is my tank the wrong one ? On my last bus I took the tank out which was original to the bus.and there was no problem there ?",
