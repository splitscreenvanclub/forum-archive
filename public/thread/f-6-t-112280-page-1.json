I've got a set now and am ready to put them in but can't find much info on the process. Don't want to mess up my shifter system by just yanking stuff apart.\n<br>\n<br>Any guidance on this operation would be great. Also if I should replace anything else at the same time, please let me know.\n<br>\n<br>I've got a kit like this:\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.busdepot.com/211711211\">http://www.busdepot.com/211711211</a>\n<!-- m -->",

Everything I read said that getting the collar loose would involve WD-40/hammers/grinders. Sprayed some oil on it,turned the screw out and slid the collar off. Removing shifter and slid the rod out. This seems too easy so something will go wrong.Will install the bushing and theoretically reinstall it tomorrow.I believe it should look like this when I'm done.",

Some head scratching as to how to get the bushing plus the clip on but in the end it just slid right on. reinstalled the shift rod then the shifter. Was a bit tricky getting it to shift again but everything settled in its place. Funny driving now as the gears feel so much more solid and almost in a different place.",

    "content" : "Having had some problems changing gears in the 67 split we decided to have a look under the van and found some differences to some vans featured, we have no collar to support the front of the gears shift and not sure if it should have one, only a couple of nuts and bolts bolt through the floor holding the gear stick in place, the front has a new bush in the nose, it has a S bent in the front section, a collar with a square head pin/screw holds the front section to the long rod, that also looks bent as it come our of the chassis, the rear has a new coupling, reverse is the worst to sellect as it keeps jumping out, and feels like it's not locating at the gearstick end.",
