George at 'The Wagen' was a very coold guy too as I picked up a rear Wolfgang safari and spent the afternoon over there. I would definetly go on to lasvegasvwclub.com, take a look and say hello mate. Excellent bunch. cant wait to go back and tear up the strip at mid night again in Georges single cab again . . . Good times. . . \n<br>\n<br>If you want need anything else ... I might be able to help too ... Vegas is an amazing place. Needs to be experienced to be believed.

    "content" : "Vegas is an awesome place, I've been quite a few times now with work and also a stopover for our honeymoon.\n<br>I would recommend getting a direct flight with Virgin or as said previously LA then drive to Vegas.\n<br>Hotels are cheaper midweek as Vegas is a mecca at weekends. Do some searching as you can get some really good deals.\n<br>\n<br>Not sure what family you have but it's an adults playground. There is so much to do apart from just gamble such as just walking round the hotels sounds weird but the ones on the strip all have a different themes.\n<br> \n<br>Also cirque du soleil shows are excellent.\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/lasvegas/en/home/index.asp?icid=dropdown/Las%20Vegas\">http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/lasvegas/ ... as%20Vegas</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>I've seen 'LE REV' which was amazing but friends who have also seen this say 'KA' and 'O' are on the same level, to be honest they're all amazing just depends on your taste and how much time, budget you have. You can get coupons from some people on the street and stores which reduce the cost. But have a look at advance booking before you go.\n<br>As previously mentioned if you can think of anything you want to do and more than likely they'll do it in Vegas.\n<br>\n<br>Another recommendation is a helicopter ride to the Grand Canyon, not cheap but better than a long drive. As with anything it all depends on your budget\n<br>\n<br>Eating / drinking out varies but some of the all you can eat buffets at the big hotels are really good deals and excellent choice of food, some of the best are Bellagio, MGM but you can have a check out whilst you are there. \n<br>The revolving restaurant at the top of the Stratosphere is amazing and worth a treat. \n<br>But on the budget side if you take yourself a couple of blocks off the strip you will find loads of cheaper restaurants and bars and the gambling have lower minimum bets and always a good place to brush up on various games without feeling intimated by the pressure of the more flashier hotels.\n<br>\n<br>Now for the important stuff VW's, like Scott says get yourself on Las Vegas VW club, and introduce yourself I did this a couple of years ago just to try and get to know a few people as I was working there on a military base for three weeks so I knew a few dubbers would be military so it would be easier for me to meet up whilst working \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> .\n<br>\n<br>Also it depends what month and time of month you are planning on going, check out the events diary.\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.lasvegasvwclub.com/vw/Forum/viewforum.php?f=5\">http://www.lasvegasvwclub.com/vw/Forum/ ... um.php?f=5</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>If you are there at the beginning of the month there's a meet called First Friday at Finlays which is excellent then on Saturday Cars &amp; coffee, they'll be in the events. And depends on how tolerant your good lady is. Obviously this didn't happen on our honeymoon, this was whilst I was working. \n<br>You'll meet some really nice and friendly people at these meets especially if you meet a few people on the net. I was made to feel really welcome and got invited by Tom Carsen's to his Classic V Dubs shop for this 60th birthday bash.\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.classicv-dubs.com\">http://www.classicv-dubs.com</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>I could probably go on and on but my main advice is get yourself on Las Vegas VW club, and introduce yourself.",
