A CKD bus will also have the SA issued M plate that is quite different to a German bus. The engine bay stamping in a CKD bus is the same as a German bus. \n<br> \n<br> If it's a fleetline totally different story. \n<br> \n<br> I have seen busses with numbers as above, normally on scrapped busses due to accident or registration duty many years over due. \n<br> \n<br> As Jim says I have also seen many fleetlines disguised or trying to be sold as early busses. \n<br> \n<br> The 'manufacture' date on a SA reg document is quite often wrong. Similar I guess to many busses UK registered many years ago. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> James\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

    "content" : "Pass. It's got late split features and the '67-only' radio delete plate on the dashboard, but I don't know whether post-67 South African or Brazilian splits had that plate. The dusty-conditions air cleaner bracket on the RH side of the engine bay stick out as it not being a typical German build, but that might be standard for a SA bus? Can't tell from the photos whether the engine vents are 'innies' or 'outies', but that change was in the early '60s anyhow.\n<br> \n<br> Have you had a scrape around where the VIN should be stamped in the engine bay to see if it was filled over by whoever painted it?\n<br> \n<br> If you want a better answer, I'd recommend that you repeat the question and pictures on The Samba. There are guys on there who could give you a much better answer based on the photos. Or maybe Google to see if there is a South African split forum.",
