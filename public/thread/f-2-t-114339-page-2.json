    "content" : "Well.....what a trip! Made it back in one piece and she didn't miss a beat! So pleased with the whole trip and how she went. Had plenty of slow accents but was so much fun. Had the drivers door handle crack on me (the inner steel actuator) but managed to get a local guy to weld it and it's as good as new!\n<br>\n<br>Over all I did nearly 4500 miles in 5 weeks which is pretty good going. It was also nice to see a few other older vehicles doing the same. Mostly guys from Holland and Germany in there 60's merc trucks. Seemed like they had the same pace as me! Got her back in the garage now for a good clean down which is much needed!\n<br>\n<br>I'd recommend everyone to do a trip like this once in there split. It becomes a real 'joined at the hip' feel after driving her every day for 5 wks. Was weird stepping into my work merc sprinter today, altho it's nice having heating! \n<br>\n<br>Planning the next trip which I think will be Ireland later this year then there might be a change of vehicle for a much bigger trip. Can't wait!",
