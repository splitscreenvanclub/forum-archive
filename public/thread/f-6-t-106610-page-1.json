    "content" : "There is a bay tank that just fits the height of the space. You will need to be quite careful as only one out of the, I think, three will fit. It also uses the screw-on pipe connector as opposed to there being a pipe actually on the tank. If it has an outlet pipe you will never get it in. Here's some pics of mine for reference. Take note of the pic where its in the bus. The shape of the bottom is arched to the shape of the shelf it sits on. None of the other bay tanks have this shape.\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/010_zpse09622f2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/010_zpse09622f2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/013_zpsb02a2f1e.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/013_zpsb02a2f1e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/012_zpsf4688ed3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/012_zpsf4688ed3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/011_zps3fda4a17.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/011_zps3fda4a17.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
