    "content" : "Ok so finally got the gearbox back in my bus yesterday so thought id fit the new CSP shifter thats been sat in a box a good while \n<br> upon removing the old shifter i thought the ball on the end looked a bit big compared to the one on the CSP but i know i have ordered a CSP shifter for a 1960 bus so not to worry i thought.... upon fitting the shifter is shifted gear but hit the dash so i tried sliding the whole unit back this resulted in inability to shift gear and find neutral..... and well it all feels like the shifter is moving way before its engaging the shift rod .....\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j61/berps/DSC_0199.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> the 2 shifters side by side\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j61/berps/DSC_0216.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> old shifter 18mm flat base ball bit 20mm across\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j61/berps/DSC_0217.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> CSP shifter 12mm flat base ball bit 15mm across\n<br> does this mean i could have possibly the wrong front shift rod in my bus??? im thinking my bus maybe has the 1959-1962 one fitted when maybe it should be the 1955-1959 one\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j61/berps/61c2ffe0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> im a tad confused???\n<br> anybody shed any light on this??\n<br> \n<br> Sean",
