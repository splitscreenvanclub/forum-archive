    "content" : "Last night I installed a dual 34 Dellorto carbs. I started the installation procedure at around 8 p.m. It wasn't easy installing it because of the cramp space of the engine bay of the split bus. With lost of patience, I was able to finish it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102106.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>the dual 34 Dellorto carbs were in good shape.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102107.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>After cleaning the cars, I replaced a new gasket to spare the carbs from possible air leak.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102108.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>I followed the same procedure on the other carb.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102109.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The carbs had to be inspected before installation to avoid duplicity of work.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102110.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The side castings, manifold and stock carbs have to be kept for a long long time.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102111.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Removing he side casting was not a walk in the park. Unscrewing the nuts were so difficult considering that the space was so tight.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102112.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Test fitting the carb was necessary so that it would be properly installed. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102113.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Same procedure was followed on the other side. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102114.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Once the carbs were in their proper places, I was ready to install the air cleaners and the linkage and the fuel hoses.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1102115.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The finished installation. When I started the engine, the dual dellortos fired up and it ran unevenly. Henceforth, I checked the idle and the linkage to get the balance idle. I was idling accordingly. Although, I there were apparent hesitations when revving it successively and it sounded like it was lacking fuel or air supply. At around 11 p.m., my wife summoned me and called my attention that the revving was so load that the silent neighborhood was now affected. Alas, I stopped and packed up wanting to set the correct timing. Although, on Saturday, I will still check it for timing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l589/dong_kg/IMG_6771.mp4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1125.photobucket.com/albums/l589/dong_kg/th_IMG_6771.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>This is the video I took the following morning. I was idling okay, but successive revving reveals that there was hesitations or flat spot, which, needs to be addressed. The roaring of the de-facto A1 muffler was music to my ears!\n<br>\n<br>QUESTION:\n<br>\n<br>Please listen to the revving sound of the engine and you will hear hesitations or flat spots after revving it in successions. What is the usual cause of these? What is the proper timing that I need to do on this? Do I need to re-jet these carbs? Or a bucket full of patience timing it will make it rev properly? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance, buddies.\n<br>\n<br>Dong",
