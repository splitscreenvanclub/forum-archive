    "content" : "There's absolutely shed loads of Aussie buses in the UK! But as Jim says, if you are only looking for the upper vents you are not going to spot most of them. I'd say as far from exclusive as you can get, I think 'common' is a better description! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>A lot are CKD's - 'Complete Knock Downs'. These were exported to Australia in parts from Germany, when VW Australia was setting up. They then assembled them in Australia. They had to use a certain percentage of Australian made parts, so you'd know it was an Aussie bus from the small details, like VDO Australia written on the Speedo. CKD's are from '55 to '59 I think. (CKD's are the same spec as UK buses of the period - so have semaphores not bullet indicators. Also, as well as VW colours like Dove Blue, they also use several Australia Only colours )\n<br>\n<br>VW got it's factory up and running in Clayton, Melbourne, and they began pressing their own panels to make their own Australian Made buses and beetles. The higher vents don't come in until quite late in production, about '63 I think.",
