I bought a 'stock' exhaust system for it but it's a rubbish fit and quite noisy...\n<br>So, thought I'd treat my self (and my bus) and look at options, and quite like the look of the U.K. Made one available from machine 7.\n<br>I want super silent! I don't need a performance upgrade, just want nice and quiet?\n<br>\n<br>Thoughts please!\n<br>\n<br>Matt",
