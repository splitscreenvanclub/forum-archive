It can be quite slow on long or steep hills. \n<br>\n<br>Just wondering whether it was worth the cost of going down the tow bar route to drag a trailer tent or maybe even an eriba pan/familia as my van is or will I need more oomph in the engine department?\n<br>\n<br>any advice greatly welcomed.\n<br>\n<br>cheers\n<br>Jezzer",
