The only bit of interior remaining was this from behind the drivers seat:\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://muchos.co.uk/members/tboarder/DSC00041.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Would this have been torvette, spaceway or other and are there any other photos I can take to help identify? Looks like it had a swing out cooker for example, there were remnants of headliner and the M codes show blank on leaving the factory. \n<br> \n<br> Any guidance welcome \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">",
