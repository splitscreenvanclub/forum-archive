    "content" : "Is it me or are there loads of vans for sale on various sites I've looked lately, Samba seems to hold quite a lot from England as does Car and classic, every where you look a bus is for sale, is the change happening or are the times a changing.\n<br> This has been talked about for many years but to me there does seem to be a glut of vans hoping to get what they ask and what they ask is a lot of money in some cases, I know people drift away, some like me, sold and found other vans to camp in, may be it's old age or time to recoup the investment or just a change of personal situations, would like comment ........\n<br> As a foot note, with all the buses available, it might make good sense to buy a bus done rather than go down the expensive and very often dangerous route of getting one restored, especially for the virgins out there.......\n<br> In dangerous read....being taken for a ride....we know who you are!!!\n<br> \n<br> Rocket Ron",
