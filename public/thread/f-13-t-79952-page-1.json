    "content" : "WELL HERE GOES ...............Came by the van about 2 years ago after selling my 58. The story goes that she had been left in an old garage in Scotland for over 20 years before the previous owner purchased her and took her to London where I then came along.\n<br>We took her off the road last December, stripped her down and in for a respray. Which obviously ended up being a tad more with few bits of welding needed etc etc etc. Got her back finished, cleaned and all put interior back in the evening before Harewood House, Leeds the first show in her, the only other show we managed to get to with her was Brighton Breeze, which was a fantastic show. The bus is 67 original rhd from the U.K. I am the 4th owner from new . Still has the original engine, interior is mostly there as original, apart from cushions, curtains and floor . Not sure really what to do with interior Ive stripped most of the old vanish off and re applied, but interiors next year.... Well hope you like! \n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/178_2369.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00037.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00035.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>[img][http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00033.jpg/img]\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00052-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/178_2369.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/178_2355.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/178_2359.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/178_2351.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00160.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/DSCN0675.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00034.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00054.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>[img][http://i1111.photobucket.com/albums/h472/how808/CNV00090.jpg/img]",
