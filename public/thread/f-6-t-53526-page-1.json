    "content" : "Hello, \n<br>Upon sanding back my '64 bug I found these rather sloppy looking welds either side of the bottom edge of my windscreen. I wondered if you can buy repair sections for these without cutting into a bug? And if I did find a bug, how different are these sections from one year to the next? From the picture tells the story half way through I took this section back. As I sanded back towards either bottom corner and a little bit upwards, this was also welded. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Also, I am looking for both A posts and wondered where I could pick some good quality ones up. I am in the UK so would prefer them to come from here but its not essential. Am ordering a couple of bits from Wolfsberg West anyway so they could come from here although I can't find them. If they come in different sizes, I would prefer as tall as possible, if they fit my bug. \n<br>\n<br>Any help would be appreciated, \n<br>Thanks, \n<br>John \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i53/johnfraser8/040420091196.jpg\">http://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i53/j ... 091196.jpg</a>\n<!-- m -->",
