Trains, main road, planes, dirty toilets, flippin 'eck! \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> Mind you - it was JUST in the Forest and no more and most people there used it as a stop off point from Southampton! \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>That one sounds MUCH better. Good call.",

Stayed there about six weeks ago. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> It was the first stop on our family tour of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall. Took about four weeks in all. Over 1000 miles!. \n<br>I'ts a big commercial site so you get all of the facilities that come with it, great for kids, however dont go if you want a break from the kids or a bit of peace and quiet. \n<br>Also if your bus is lowered watch out for the killer speed humps. By-standers will point and cringe as your steering box grinds across the top!",

    "content" : "Hi Steve, \n<br> \n<br>Just tried to reply to your private message, spent ages describing the sites that we stayed at and then went to send it and the damn thing vanished...Doh!! \n<br> \n<br>Here's a much shorter version.. \n<br> \n<br>We travelled from the new forrest around the coast of Dorset, Devon and Cornwall and then back to Gloucester over the course of three and a half weeks. \n<br>To be honest, we found most of the sites to be pretty much average, most have redeeming features, but are poor in other ways. \n<br>The exceptions to this were the following sites that we liked a lot and were the only ones that we would recommend or want to stay at again.... \n<br> \n<br>1. Trethem mill \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.trethem.com\">www.trethem.com</a>\n<!-- w --> \n<br> \n<br> This site is located in Truro, Cornwall. This was our favourite site by miles, its quite small so dosent have a bar etc. but the owners are very friendly, great for kids (games room, football pitch, play area) excellent toilets and showers, Terraced pitches with view of valley. \n<br> \n<br>2. Oakdown - Sidmouth. \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.oakdown.co.uk\">www.oakdown.co.uk</a>\n<!-- w --> \n<br> \n<br>The website dose'nt do this place justice, its really lovely. Excellent facilities, Donkey sanctury, small golf course, nature walks, laundry, games room etc. Just avoid the pitches that back on to the road as it can be a bit noisy. \n<br> \n<br>3. Dornafield - Newton Abbot. \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.dornafield.com\">www.dornafield.com</a>\n<!-- w --> \n<br> \n<br>Slightly larger site and has without a doubt the best toilets/showers anywhere we have stayed. Very helpfull and friendly staff (they let us drive around and choose our pitch) Childrens play area, shop etc. The best pitches are at the top by the childrens area, try and get one of these if you can. \n<br> \n<br>To sum up, So many factors can influence your stay at any site, but my best advice to you would go for sites that are recommended by the caravan club, I know they are a bunch of stuffy old gits with 30 grand 4x4's pulling equally expensive white boxes, but they dont stay at places with skids in the pan, no bog roll or pubes on the soap...... unless you like that kind of place?!! \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\">",
