The chap told me that beetle ones were the sort i was after but that depended upon some small section of pipe being available to where it attaches to the bus. Totally useless post at the moment I appreciate as I haven't had time to check it out but if someone else reads this and knows maybe they could confirm it for you/us.\n<br> \n<br> RD \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
