    "content" : "also, how tight should you do up the little bolt which holds the wiper arms to the spindles?\n<br> \n<br> If you do it up reasonably tight the wiper arms do not move onto the windows as the spindles do not appear to rotate - by doing it not so tight the wipers move onto the screen, but the bolt gouges at the metal of the spindle - this seems like a poor design, unless i'm missing something?\n<br> \n<br> thanks\n<br> ps - couldn't seem to edit my original post, hence the reason for the 'reply'",
