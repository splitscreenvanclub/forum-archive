    "content" : "Original paint with plenty of original patina 1965 LHD Sportmobile camper for sale in original paint with plenty of patina. We bought this van over 7 years ago and have enjoyed every moment of ownership and she still puts a smile on my face. When we started looking for a van 7 years ago we originally wanted a nice shiny paint new van, but saw this and bought it on the spot for the asking price without even negotiating, it has us at first sight!! Thus very reluctant sale and only selling as house renovation funds are now depleted!!\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40010&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_5027 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_5027 R1.jpg (121.7 KiB) Viewed 1842 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40011&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_5023 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_5023 R1.jpg (112.53 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40012&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_5030 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_5030 R1.jpg (119.56 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40013&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_5031 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_5031 R1.jpg (96.05 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> The vans itself is a Sportmobile conversion, very similar to Sundials however we have enough of the original interior to confirm this i.e. lights, table, side table etc. The exterior of the van also sports the Airstream style windows.\n<br> \n<br> A bit of known history on the van:\n<br> \n<br> The bus was delivered to the US from Germany as a panel van to the Allied Refrigeration Corporation of Pueblo Colorado, but with options of deluxe bumpers. logo and hubcaps and being a factory 12v, apparently 65 being the first year is was available in the US as an option only, with the 6v system being standard in the US until 1967. Allied used the van for 6 years as a demo/sales vehicle before selling it on in 1971 to its second owner who had it until 1995. The third owner then replaced the engine with a 1971 dual port 1600cc unit along with various modifications to the interior. Whilst with its latest owner it is said that the van drove like a magic caret making daily journeys up to the Rocky Mountains. The owner lived in Cascade - Colorado believed to be a little canyon mid-way down the UTE pass hence the heavily stone chipped front end (behind the towel rails is preserved original paint). The van came over to the UK in 2005 to its first UK owner In Retford, then went to its second in Litchfield in 2007 and then over to Louth in 2012 prior to us purchasing it in 2013.\n<br> \n<br> Over the years lots of money has been spent on this van, with all receipts presented in a file, the highlights being:\n<br> £8.5k at T2D for various modifications\n<br> £6k bespoke hardwood and vinyl interior by Spirit of the 50's inc. Rock n Roll bed and new headlining\n<br> £1k CSP front disc brake kit\n<br> £1.6k at Absolute VW inc. seatbelt installation\n<br> £1.3k at Absolute VW for general maintenance \n<br> £800 at Clarkes Automotive for general maintenance\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40009&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_2447 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_2447 R1.jpg (77.5 KiB) Viewed 1843 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40014&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_2448 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_2448 R1.jpg (71.78 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40015&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_2751 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_2751 R1.jpg (86.64 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40016&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_2752 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_2752 R1.jpg (76.97 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> The original VW service book is included along with a copy of the US State of Colorado Certificate of Title for the van and there are a number of old MOT certificates. \n<br> \n<br> The van is an original factory 12v and has the following modifications:\n<br> \n<br> Narrowed front beam\n<br> Dropped spindles\n<br> IRS'd\n<br> Raised steering box\n<br> Twin batteries (i.e. leisure battery with 240v)\n<br> Firetec extinguisher system\n<br> Amp/speakers and streo system\n<br> 1600 engine with twin kardons\n<br> Two roof racks (included if asking price is met)\n<br> 15\" painted steel wheels with big logo hubcaps (original 14\"'s included if asking price is met)\n<br> Extra gauges in the air box\n<br> New rear box\n<br> Type 3 rear brakes\n<br> CSP discs up front\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40017&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_5022 R1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   IMG_5022 R1.jpg (100.91 KiB) Viewed 1841 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> Lots of other bits and bobs, spare parts etc. including headlights, window cranks, toolkit etc (included if asking price met)\n<br> \n<br> The bus drives great and has plenty of pull for cursing on the motorway 65-70mph and is a surprisingly soft ride for a lowered van. Considering it is 99% original paint the bodywork isn't bad at all there are a few areas that could do with some attention but nothing which effects a MOT and I suppose is down to personal taste. The original Allied Refrigeration signwriting is still present on the passenger door, the drivers door was removed by a previous owner who decide to try and T-cut the van!!!, the writing is still vaguely visible and could be re-done if the new owner wished. These areas were on the van when we bought it but I left them as they were as they are all part of the character/history of the van, but want to be open and honest at the same time:\n<br> \n<br> Short cill has started to go at floor level and think could be repaired\n<br> Long cill has had a repair in the past with a paint brush finish\n<br> Front windscreen has bubbling under the seals at both corners\n<br> Small area of bubbling under the rear windscreen under the seal\n<br> Inner valance has had a couple of patches previously\n<br> Front panel is covered in stone chips as per the history and there are some dents/dings in the bodywork but all part of its history along with the electric socket/plugs to the rear quarter and CB radio aerial on the roof.\n<br> \n<br> The van has just been to Clarkes Automotive for a quick one over and service as in all honesty it hasn't been used that much over the past couple of years and has just been MOT'd April 2020 to give some reassurance to new owner.\n<br> \n<br> Dry stored in my ownership to maintain that paint/patina.\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=40008&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=40008&amp;t=1&amp;sid=9628d912617002280b2c408135359c67\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_2451.JPG\" title=\"IMG_2451.JPG (92.63 KiB) Viewed 1844 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> Asking for £26k which I think is a fair price. \n<br> \n<br> In summary, a good solid van in all the right places, with plenty of history and a nice story to tell at the same time. Intended to be a long term keeper to have camping trips aboard, however time and circumstances have changed so needs must. Priced fairly and would appreciate no dreamers, tyre kickers, time wasters etc. and ultimately if it doesn't sell will just keep the old girl, being renovating the house for 10yrs anyway so what's a few more years going to hurt!!\n<br> \n<br> Based in Nottingham.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for reading",
