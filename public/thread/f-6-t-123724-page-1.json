    "content" : "I’m currently away in Cornwall and yesterday I had someone stop me to say they had followed me for several miles into Fowey and I had no brake lights. I have a dual circuit upgrade with a vwjim remote servo. \n<br> \n<br> I’ve touched the two wires from the switch together and the lights come on so I assumed it was the switch. However, if I stand on the brakes really hard the switch does activate the lights. Hence the problem seems to be that the switch doesn’t activate with lighter pressure and I rarely have to stand on the brakes at the pressure required to activate the lights. I know there are various discussions about faulty switches etc but it doesn’t appear to be the switch itself so what are my options?\n<br> \n<br> I guess I may have to just live with it for the final few days of our holiday but now it’s been pointed out to me I’m paranoid every time I drive along the small roads and hills of Cornwall with anyone behind me. \n<br> \n<br> Any advice gratefully received. \n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
