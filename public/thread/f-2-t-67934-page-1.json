    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>I'm currently out in India and have been admiring the headlights on the Bajaj-made tuk-tuks (see here \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.indianexporters.com/uploadedimages/498514.jpg\">http://www.indianexporters.com/uploaded ... 498514.jpg</a>\n<!-- m -->). They remind me of cyclops lights and was asking the chaps out here how much they go for - estimate is 500 rupees MAX for a brand new one including the light, lens etc etc. Not sure what the lamp diameter is - presume the normal cyclops lights you see are 7\" diameter? I'm guessing these are only 5\" but will check them out.\n<br>\n<br>Thinking of bringing one back to see what it's like - anyone tried them before? Don't really want to fit one to my van, but if anyone is interested in trying it let me know. At about £8 they seem a bargain!\n<br>\n<br>James",

OK, this seems to be developing a bit more than I had planned! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>I am here (India) until Sunday. I only have tomorrow off so will try to track them down and get a definite price etc. I will buy a very small number to bring back (1 to 3 depending on size) and use them to find out how much postage would be from India directly back to the UK. When I get back I'll look at postage around UK - presume standard parcels will be about a tenner or so.\n<br>\n<br>I'll try to post that up my findings on Friday morning (UK time), so then if anyone wants me to send one from here I may have time after work on Saturday (Sunday I intend to watch the GP so will be busy!). If that's no good then I will pick up more next time I am over here or ask one of the guys here if they would be willing to collect, pack and send them.\n<br>\n<br>Might be an idea to wait and see what they are like - I would imagine that the quality may not be world class etc... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>One thing I am not sure about is import duty - what I bring over in my case probably won't attract attention, but if I post stuff from here that may be more tricky. I'll look into it!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>James",

Have bought two lamps, a small one (approx 4\" diameter I would estimate) and a larger one (approx 6\" diameter). Housings are plastic, larger one has chrome ring and plain glass with shaped reflector (like modern cars), smaller one has painted rim and fluted glass. I don't know how well the housings will match the roof profile - will have to suck it and see I guess.\n<br>\n<br>Here you can see the relative sizes and the side on profiles:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Cyclops/23072010_005.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Here is the large one, loosely assembled:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Cyclops/23072010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And here is the small one loosely assembled:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Cyclops/23072010_003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The first people who said they wanted them were Shaggy and Erna \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cat.gif\" alt=\":cat:\" title=\"cat\"> in that order, so to be fair I guess first choice is Shaggy's and Erna \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cat.gif\" alt=\":cat:\" title=\"cat\"> gets the other if interested.\n<br>\n<br>Price for all this booty, including bulbs? 550rupees, or less than a tenner. And that is for both! Could have saved 70 rupees by going for non-halogen bulbs, but I thought what the hell, in for a penny etc. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>I am afraid I will struggle to get more in my case this time round, but Carlos has said he is coming out here for 8 weeks in October and can probably ship stuff back to the UK then. If we get these two back and fitted maybe then people can decide which they prefer and we can get a bulk shipment sorted out. I'm sure I'll be back here some time too, or if we want to look into shipping some on spec now then please let me know ASAP.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, I'm off to get myself a nice lunch somewhere. Or at least something edible and (hopefully) not curried - I am all curried out after 12 days here!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>James",
