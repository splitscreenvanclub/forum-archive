    "content" : "Hi all. I am relatively new to the VW splitscreen camper scene but have been searching for one for a while.\n<br> I have found a splitscreen camper that I am interested in buying but it is in Ellesmere Shropshire and I am down South near Southampton. I know that any prospective purchase should be inspected beforehand but I have been to view 3 different campers so far and have travelled a long way to see two of them only to find that they were not as described at all (one of them was full of filler even though it was described as the body being perfect)\n<br> Does anyone know of a company or an individual who would inspect a vehicle in Ellesmere as paying for an inspection would be cheaper for me than having to travel there myself to view it, which might be another waste of time. Getting a bit disillusioned with some peoples descriptions of their Van's but hopefully this one might be better.\n<br> Thanks\n<br> Steve",

At least an initial assessment from a set of pictures may be possible before you spend hours driving to see it even if they can’t get to it physically?\n<br> \n<br> Appreciate that getting to see them all isn’t easy and you need to make the right decision so you really have to be sure of things. Equally, travelling for the right one will be worth it in the end. \n<br> \n<br> I’m sure there will be plenty of support from folk on here. \n<br> \n<br> Apologies I can’t help with your Shropshire option though. \n<br> \n<br> Steve\n<br> \n<br> Ps - As I said before, if you did ever fancy a trip my direction let me know - I’d be happy for you to ask people on here for comments first! - just kidding as I know mine isn’t what you are after.",

    "content" : "Hi Steve,\n<br> \n<br> maybe you could get in touch with creative coachworks. They are based in Shropshire and may inspect a van for you. They may not but just an idea for you. I just recalled there being a vw business nearby where the van you are interested is. \n<br> \n<br> of course, you could buy mine which I know is awesome \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br> \n<br> thanks\n<br> jezzer",
