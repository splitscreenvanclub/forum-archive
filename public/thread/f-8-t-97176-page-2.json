Feel under pressure to perform now!\n<br> \n<br> Just back from Busfest and managed to pick the brains of some really knowledgeable Bus owners (especially the couple with a mouse grey/white 62 S033 mosaic-what a cool bus you have man). Feeling optimistic for the future of my little red van - I'm giving myself until Busfest next year to get it sorted. I say sorted, that might mean limping an empty, barely MOT'd painted van through the gates like a staggering bewildered wino, but right now I'd snap yer hand off for that outcome.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_blackeye.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":blackeye:\" title=\"blackeye\"> \n<br> \n<br> Wasted Spark - I would say definitely talk to them, they are very approachable people.

I was pretty green going into it and had imagined I could have waltzed it through a quick MOT whilst restoring it on the road - I would say that was more my lack of knowledge and experience than anything else... Given the chance to do it again, I would spend more time looking at more vans for sure, just to understand what's out there.

How the hell do you get a neat finish in behind the wind deflector???? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/framepainted_zpsfd964068.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/qlight1_zpsa5ce3c52.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/qlight2_zpsdc7595ba.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/windowassembled_zpsce9fc450.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/windowsfinished_zps559f3970.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Then pop outs... I have a fine texture on all my windows, like they have been lightly sandblasted on one side! I had a go at them with some of that Cerium Oxide paste and a polishing pad and was amazed how well they came out. Was convinced that stuff was a scam...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/popoutsdone_zps466c4711.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br> We thought while the beige was in the gun, we should give the headlights a once over (I know, it's not OG, but thought it would be pretty close... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> )\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/headlights_zpsfe403d05.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Next up was to fit the mesh grey seat covers I have had waiting. They went on pretty well for a ham-fisted Welshman (I wont mention the small tear where I should have heated them up a bit more with the hairdryer...)\n<br> \n<br> Used Webbing to protect the seat pads...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/seatbase1_zps7a7d3f1c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/seatbase2_zps274dde64.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/seatfoam_zps90022532.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Just to prove I exist and do some of the work!!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Lawseat_zps25825a62.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Of course this little dude did all the hard stuff...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Ioanseat_zps49db9185.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> With several boxes of parts to go through, had some quality time with my Autosol and a collection of tea towels and other kitchen implements. Kitchen became Bus-Lab over half term. Ssshhhhh...\n<br> \n<br> Sub hatch and Westy roof bracketry...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/subbrackets_zps522b317c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/roofbrackets_zps8cf0c936.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> So although I've not been bone idle, I really want to make head roads into the bigger jobs - Doors whilst the body is away, then decide how far to take the mechanicals. I'm pulling out the beam to sort the slop in the steering, and the gearbox for new mounts, but whilst it isn't jumping out of gear anywhere I'm just going to do a transmission oil change, output shaft seal and renew the clutch bearing release arm - the notches on the forks are almost through to the other side.\n<br> \n<br> Looking forward to the frozen months.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\">",
