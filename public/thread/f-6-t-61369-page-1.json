If so and it was me i'd consider getting this done again. I'd say you was talking £500 to £1000! I am basing this on when I considered getting my Merc Vito done for my Detailing business and this design I did was going to cost £1100 by Signs Express\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i201/smokey182/HiResTop.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>A good lower half only respray will probably cost approimately £2000 to £2500 depending on who and where\n<br>\n<br>Erran",
