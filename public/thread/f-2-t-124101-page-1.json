I don't have any more details at the moment but I wanted to let you all know as Mick was a trully awesome guy! You'll probably remember him for his trade stand at all the big VW events selling super cool wheels and dubious saucy strikers! Mick was one of the good guys and a real charactor in every way. I and anyone that knew him will miss him immensely. God bless you my friend.",
