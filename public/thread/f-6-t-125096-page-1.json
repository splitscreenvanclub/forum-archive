    "content" : "So long story short bus runs fine for about half hour then when accelerating say up a slip road or out of a bend or de restiction it hesitates/stumbles a bit like it's missed fire maybe then as soon as the rpm picks up a little perfect. I've tested coil and condesor with multimeter both check out ok\n<img alt=\"ðŸ™„\" class=\"emoji smilies\" draggable=\"false\" src=\"//twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f644.svg\">\n<br> \n<br> Idle is perfect, runs cruises at speed perfect.\n<br> \n<br> I thought fuel issue so replaced fuel filters before and after the pump (one in pressure regulator) stripped both carbs down cleaned all jets etc. Twin 34ict\n<br> \n<br> Valve clearances spot on. Drives well off the bat but after half hour as mentioned above. I've eliminated fueling so it's got to be coil? Condenser only replaced a few thousand miles ago as a service item with new points .",

After about 1 1/2 hrs driving it just start to splutter a bit, sometimes backfire but only once, and dies.\n<br> It doesn't want to start again till the engine is cold and then it goes again.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers,\n<br> Gertjan",
