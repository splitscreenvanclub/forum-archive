    "content" : "I sent it back, as they lied about the spec', and the lock system was pretty poor. \n<br> \n<br> Plus its a lift, not a working platform, so it's not too be worked on underneath, which defeats the point of having it. By the time you have the lift and axle stands underneath, your access is limited too much for me.",
