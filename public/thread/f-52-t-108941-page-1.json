    "content" : "I am reluctantly putting my Porsche 912 up for sale.\n<br>\n<br>It's a 1967, California Import (2002), Polo red, SWB, 5 green dial dash, sitting on recently refurbished deep six fuchs with hearts. It has been slightly lowered and has red konis on each corner. The front seats and door cards have been re-upholstered and it has a rare (read very expensive!) original woodrim Porsche steering wheel. \n<br>\n<br>Some may call it an outlaw 12 as it has a 2110cc VW stroker engine, with dual 44 webbers, engle 120 cam and straight cut cam gears and porsche style fan and shroud. (for full spec of the engine see photos below). It also has a stainless steel tuck away exhaust. This car can move! \n<br>\n<br>Here's a link to the engine being built by Powerhaus in the US before I had it shipped over.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.powerhausvwparts.com/Ed_B...0cc_Engine.php\">http://www.powerhausvwparts.com/Ed_B...0cc_Engine.php</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>The paint work is not concours but is pretty good, there are the odd bumps and scrapes but these are minimal. There is some small damage to the front nearside wheel arch where the wheel hit a pot hole as the car was turning and it has cracked some of the paint there. I will take a picture of this but it really isn't too bad at all.\n<br>\n<br>I have the Porsche birth certificate and piles and piles of paperwork including all the import documents from 2002.\n<br>\n<br>It will have a fresh and full MOT (it's booked in for next week) and I have just renewed the (free) road tax.\n<br>\n<br>When I bought the car 5 years ago it already had a vw engine in it which I replaced with the one above. I do not have the original 912 engine. \n<br>\n<br>I am asking for Â£23,000 for the car.\n<br>\n<br>Ok some pictures! I took these in the garage at home last night after work. I will get some proper shots at the weekend.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1311.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1311.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1313.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1313.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1314.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1314.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1320.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1320.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The re-upholstered seats and door cards.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1316.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1316.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1315.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1315.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1312.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1312.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The cracked paint from the pot hole incident.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1309.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1309.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The super rare very expensive original Porsche woodrim steering wheel - one of these on US ebay right now for $2200 needing refurbshment!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1307.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1307.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>An engine teaser to finish with!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1318.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1318.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Here's the engine specs.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1301.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1301.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s158.photobucket.com/user/Ed_B28/media/IMG_1302.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t110/Ed_B28/IMG_1302.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
