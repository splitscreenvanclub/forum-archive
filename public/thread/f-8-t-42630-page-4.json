It is my fault as I only put one coat on when I should have done 2....as per the instructions.\n<br>\n<br>Now there is no way I'm getting in there again with the angle grider and a wire wheel, so there is a blast comapny just round the corner from me here in Gosport. Dropped them an email to get a quote on getting the inside, bumpers and door tops done and they quoted £400 with an option of £100 to give it a zinc primer blast....which I'll get done.\n<br>\n<br>I should get a bonus at work in Nov so that's what I'm gonna get done. \n<br>\n<br>Andy",

    "content" : "Well I know for sure that the last time I worked on the bus was October last year, and that was to fix a leaky CV boot and before that.......well according to this thread was August time. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>I have been struggling for enthusiasm to work on the bus, have seriuosly thought of getting rid of it, but I'm slowly getting back on it. Cleaned out the garage a few weeks ago so it's all nice and tidy and ready to start on the bus and then I found myself allways finding something else that took priority, I'm sure a lot of us have been there!\n<br>\n<br>However the other weekend Clare told me to get my ass in gear, so I decided to start off with a few small hopefully easy jobs to get me in into the swing.\n<br>\n<br>The first was to install the main section of wiring loom into the chassis sections ( by my self ) so while sitting on the floor in the garage deciding on the best way to do this I saw a piece of 15 mm plumbers plstic pipe ( the stuff that's used instead of copper pipe ). \n<br>So i fed the rear light cables up inside the pipe, secured with masking tape and then taped up every 6 inches or so.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s178.photobucket.com/user/clareyf/media/61%20Split/box007.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/box007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s178.photobucket.com/user/clareyf/media/61%20Split/box006.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/box006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s178.photobucket.com/user/clareyf/media/61%20Split/box008.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/box008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Fed it from the center of the bus though to the rear first and then did the same with the front section. The rear was a doddle , the front...I had enough arm span to to get to both sides of the front chassis box section, so was pretty easy as well.\n<br>\n<br>With that done and feeling pretty pleased with myself, i decided to fit the VWJim bearing nut replacments. So easy to do and well worth the money \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s178.photobucket.com/user/clareyf/media/61%20Split/box009.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/box009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And finally to finish off i decided to loose fit the Butty's accelerator replacement\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s178.photobucket.com/user/clareyf/media/61%20Split/box010.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/box010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Again, a great bit of kit and well worth the money \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>That's it for now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

    "content" : "2 Post on my thread in one day !!!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks Guys, it's actually going not bad. I always forget to take the camera down the garage with me !!\n<br>\n<br>I'm pretty much just prepping it ready for the MOT which hopefully may be in a couple of weeks. The plan is to put in in for the MOT with as min as possible, no glass etc . S0 the electrics are all up and running, the engine is in ( more on that later ), got it running, but a real pain to start and running like a bag of nails, couldn't work out why and then searching on the internet found the reason.......I had set up the static timing. did that thought, well i'll give the key a quick flip to see, and started straight up. Fantastic...... I thought.\n<br>\n<br>Left it for a couple of days and decided to get the strobe light on it, the colourtune ( for the fuel air mix ) and compression tester.\n<br>\n<br>Could not get the fuel air mix right until the mix screw was literally just about to drop out ( but when you wre there it sounded perfect )so I have the carb off checking for a blockage etc.\n<br>\n<br>As for the compression testing, I got \n<br>No 1 - 150\n<br>No 2 - 145\n<br>No 3 - 145 \n<br>No 4 - 137\n<br>\n<br>not too bad I thought ( 1600 single port ), bit curious as to why No 4 was lower, when to put the plug back in and it wouldn't tighten up, the thread is gone. Soooo the engine is coming out tomorrow, gonna drop the head down at a place called TK engineering in Fareham, let them do a helicoil , hopefully when I get that back I will have cleared ( if that is the problem ) the blockage in the carb so the engine can go back in ...all sounds pretty straight forward eh?\n<br>\n<br>So we are going full out to get ready for an MOT. After that, home strip out, spray with celly in the garage, put all back together and defo, and I mean defo be on the road for next year.\n<br>\n<br>Probably not that exciting to most but this video was a couple of weeks back when I got the lights etc working\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/andyf-SSVC-Mobile-2.mp4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/th_andyf-SSVC-Mobile-2.mp4\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>And then the first time we got the engine running\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/andyf-SSVC-Mobile.mp4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/th_andyf-SSVC-Mobile.mp4\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I was really pleased with the engine, me and my mate Toby who's been helping me, we'd never stripped an engine down before and rebuilt it. I did the oil galleries whist stripped down so fingers crossed it should be god for a good few years.\n<br>\n<br>So hopefully next update will be the bus passing the MOT, \n<br>\n<br>Andy",
