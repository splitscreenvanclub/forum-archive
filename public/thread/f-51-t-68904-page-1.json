    "content" : "<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">This is a unique opportunity to acquire an original and unrestored 1966 RHD Split Screen Panel Van, with double side doors on both nearside and offside. Present owner since 1972. Dry stored from 1972 until 2009</span>.\n<br>\n<br>This Split Screen van is being sold reluctantly by the present owner, an SSVC member.\n<br>\n<br>The original green log book is still held and it shows that the van was first registered on 24 February 1966. The van has been owned by the present owner since 1972.\n<br>\n<br>The van was dry stored from 1972 until 1993. It was MOT'd on 17 August 1993 with a mileage of 73,720. It was dry stored again after that until 2009 when it was MOT'd on 2 November 2009 with a mileage of 74,808. It starts first time and was driven to one of the recent VW shows.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #0040FF\">The van still has the original Dove Blue paintwork</span>. It has never been welded or painted. There is no rust underneath and it does not require any welding. After it was bought in 1972, the van was extensively rustproofed using dinitrol.\n<br>\n<br>The van has double side doors on each side. The first user was a catering firm which ordered it with this configuration. A split screen van with this configuration is now probably unique in the UK.\n<br>\n<br>The 1500cc engine was replaced with a 1600cc engine many years ago. (The engine replacement was done by John Maher when he was based in England.) It has an alternator conversion. There is also an oil pressure gauge.\n<br>\n<br>An electric fuel pump is fitted on the left hand side of the engine bay. The original mechanical fuel pump is still in place and can be brought into use by refitting the fuel lines, etc. There is a new battery which can be seen in the photo.\n<br>\n<br>The van is lined inside and is fitted with benches on either side of the side door openings. The seats have been reupholstered (in very good condition under the seat covers in the photo). The floor mat is underneath the carpet. The radio is a Blaupunkt and is believed to be original.\n<br>\n<br>There are also a large number of Split Screen spare parts (floor mat, wheels, new chrome hub caps, front axle, rear axle with gearbox, etc.) which are available separately by negotiation.\n<br>\n<br>Price = Â£16,000. Viewing in September by arrangement.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/1Front.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/2FrontandNearside.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/3FrontandOffside.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/4Nearsidesidedoors.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/6Rear.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/7Dashboardandcontrols.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/8EngineBayandengine.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/9EngineBaynearside.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i942.photobucket.com/albums/ad270/split_screen/1966%20RHD%20Split%20Screen%20Panel%20van/10EngineBayoffside.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
