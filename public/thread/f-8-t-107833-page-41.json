    "content" : "Z14 Supplement is on thesamba.com.\n<br> It was good for showing locations of centres etc. The original fittings were for threaded holes for fitting M24 adaptors to 7/16\"UNF. We simply used nutted plates with 7/16\" fittings.\n<br> Cheapest I found was on Driftworks..but sold on eBay C&amp;C etc.\n<br> Some we used were threaded holes in bar sections.\n<br> \n<br> For my 64 we used some 3mm flat section formed to suit the location to get holes on tool box for three belts. Two inertia reel and centre lap belt.\n<br> \n<br> I will measure what we have fitted to my 64 and gather all the pictures I have and fabrication drawings and post here.\n<br> Post above has drawings for the two tubes etc.\n<br> I will be fitting two inertia reel and two centre lap belt from these two tubes ..\n<br> Maybe...a little close together you may want to modify.?\n<br> G",
