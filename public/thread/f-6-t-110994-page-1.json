    "content" : "Hi I am running in a 1776cc with twin 40s.\n<br>I would like recommendations for carb and rolling road set up. I have build spec and car set up spec for engine.\n<br>\n<br>Engine was turn key broken in on test bed and dyno figures run on 90 octane fuel at 72 degrees so not in UK.\n<br>\n<br>The vehicle has sat with very little use during fit out for around a year not run on the road. Did start and idle regularly up to temperature but not run in anger. They dragged a liitle dust in on initial running and would not idle so idle set up higher. Presently they will not idle when cold and idle ( too high?) at around 1000 - 1100 when warm.\n<br>Want the carbs cleaning checking vents checking for 95 octane and or setting on rolling road.\n<br>Running mechanical fuel pump and had to adjust the fuel pressure down.\n<br>Have fitted twin throttle springs to reduce an initial problem with throttles not closing and being slow to respond when taking foot off accelerator.\n<br>\n<br>Thoughts on mileage to run before setting up and recommendations for VW experienced weber set up people and rolling road. .\n<br>\n<br>Only done around 500 miles so far!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers",

    "content" : "Thanks eddy..\n<br>I think I have decided to go with Peter because I work most of the time in Derby so it would fit to go to work and on for tuning or go for tuning and on to work. ..\n<br>Wanted to get a little more miles on the clock first..have only done around 500 so far..\n<br>Aim to get 1000...oil change check things and then off for a check..\n<br>Also want to do some cleaning myself. .\n<br>Engine was built for low octane higher temperature running with reamed jets..\n<br>Need someone with experience to play..\n<br>Matt is efi turbo fuel injected nitro head..says he knows little about carbs.. B'S. ..but he wants dyno check with RnR proof...\n<br>Maybe will be in the next couple of weeks.\n<br>Engine was turn key but may have ingested a bit of paint blocking dust and tank debris. \n<br>Fuel filter is clean though so suspect build debris and or Dusty Dave Debris...\n<br>\n<br>LOL",
