    "content" : "Oh forgot to say the Porsche Motor was set up at Petes rolling road Royston, Cambs and it has 160bhp at the rear wheels.......we fitted a milder cam for road use......but it would take much if you wanted to run a monster motor with big cam..............not my cup of tea as I like the way it drives as is...........\n<br>We fitted brand new 2.4 barrels and pistons and overhauled and renewed the bearings shells seals etc.......\n<br>New clutch as well...........\n<br>\n<br>The idea was so i could enjoy cruising around locally and when on a road trip be able to cruise at normal motorway speeds and not have to pull into the slow lane when a hill appeared...........\n<br>Due to the van being lowered and the creative rack and pinion steering and CSP discs up front on a servo the van handles superbly.........\n<br>The Spax adjustable shocks make it easy to set up.\n<br>The exhaust is a one off as i wanted to be able to remove the exhaust without risking damaging the head studs,so i had four short stub pipes made so the exhaust can be removed leaving the four pipes in situ........\n<br>I have also fitted a MCJ rosewood steering wheel......which feels awesome in your hands.......the control knobs are billet aluminum.\n<br>The windscreen wipers are the best you can buy and are detachable.......but they are totally Rubbish....!!!\n<br>As are all split screen wipers..........they cost me £160.00......... A friend of mine has recently fitted a vauxhall wiper motor that fits straight in without to much messing..........he says it works great..................\n<br>The head lamps are brand new hella...\n<br>The five wire original indicator unit allows the brake lights and side lights to be used as indicators.......no Orange on my bus..........\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>A brand new early split rubber mat is fitted..........\n<br>As I say check out the build in rides and projects..........it took 3 years to build................I have built 7 vans over the years but this is the best by far..........if I had the room I keep it forever but I can't bare keeping it outside...............\n<br>In fact I'm really having difficulty thinking of selling my masterpiece.........but there you go....I'll grit my teeth .............and bare it...............\n<br>Just in case you've missed my Location .......I Live in Enfield North London",
