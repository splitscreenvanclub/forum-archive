    "content" : "Hi Guys, I'm new here, please be gentle!\n<br>\n<br>Following on from all the fires you hear and read about I wish to replace all my fuel lines, from tank to carbs etc. and naturally I'm going for the SAE J30 R9 Codan stuff.\n<br>\n<br>Questions as follows. The feed directly from the tank, can this be accessed easily from underneath to attach the new pipe or is it an engine out job to gain access? Does anyone have a link to share featuring the whole or some of the process?\n<br>\n<br>Also, I'm running 2 Dellorto carbs which have larger bore feed inlets than the tank, pump etc., how do you guys usually and safely get around this challenge? I'm reading differing views.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance\n<br>AT",

    "content" : "Thanks 21f, I want to retain the stock pump as I would like to keep my engine bay looking stock(ish).\n<br>\n<br>Fuel cut off valve is a great shout, but where would it best be fitted? If I fitted a mechanical switch I'd have to turn it off, so assuming the worse and my bus is now on fire I won't want to venture into the engine bay to activate it. If I went down the electric route, again assuming the worse, I'm on fire, I run the risk of the power feed or the pump already having melted and rendering the 'on' switch useless.\n<br>\n<br>I do appreciate there are a number of fire suppression kits available, however I'd like to stay stock hence this important upgrade.",
