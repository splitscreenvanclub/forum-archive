    "content" : "Yes the 'change over' years are the production years from 62 - 63, I think probably August of those years, but no doubt someone with greater knowledge of chassis / part numbers and dates will know better.\n<br>\n<br>Obviously every year saw some development change, but 62-63 marked significant visual and mechanical change. \n<br>\n<br>Mechanically it was the change from 3/4 ton to 1ton running gear (Steering knuckles, 14\" rims, bigger brakes and revised transmission ratios in combination with the 1500 sp engine)\n<br>\n<br>Visually it was the last years of the small rear hatch / window, bullet indicators and the start of the amber and red rear lights. The ends of the bumpers changed from 'slash cut' to rounded. And i think the 'church key' operation of the engine lid and petrol flap was one of the last features to change - although this may be in the 64-65 production year.\n<br>\n<br>There are some interesting features that only exist for this transition period as well - recessed cab door pull handles and a swagged rear wheel arch lip but with protruding engine louvres are two that spring to mind. I think a Volkswagen emblem on the engine lid hinge panel only ran for one year.\n<br>\n<br>I'm no experts on the exact changes and exact dates, but this period can be seen as the last significant development period to the split before it was super seceded by the bay.\n<br>It's also a period that can through up some odd anomalies in terms of certain parts speced on certain vehicles. For example Andy's late August 61 ambulance ( in the build thread) appears to have come as standard with the two tone rear lights although I believe it's about 11 months prior to production line fitment of this style of rear light.",
