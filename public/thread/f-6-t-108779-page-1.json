So far I have an AH code gearbox, 1303 A arms, 1303 drive shafts and 1303 brakes. \n<br>\n<br>In my simple head these should all fit along with a bolt together conversion kit.( I am looking at Bus Boys)\n<br>\n<br>Do I have to modify the A arms in any way ?\n<br>\n<br>Are the drive shafts suitable?\n<br>\n<br>My plan would be to use the brakes with new drums( 5x130 from M7). I have CSP disks on the front and plan to fit a servo. Will these be suitable?\n<br>\n<br>Any advice would be appreciated\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Gavin",
