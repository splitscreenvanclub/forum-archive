It fits \n<br>the diesel and any Rabbit, Golf or Jetta. It normally holds the engine at a 15ยบ \n<br>angle but is available at 50ยบ for Vanagons. The kit cost $400. Keep your '67 \n<br>200mm clutch but you will need our $185 starter motor to crank a diesel. \n<br> \n<br>You should not need a rear engine mount. \n<br>HK \n<br> \n<br>KENNEDY ENGINEERED PRODUCTS 661-272-1147 \n<br>38830 17th St. E Fax: \n<br>661-272-1575 \n<br>Palmdale, CA 93550 \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>More details to be added later",
