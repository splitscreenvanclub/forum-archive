    "content" : "I fitted a Vintage Speed exhaust - looks and sounds very nice. \n<br>\n<br>You can make J- tubes out of any of the heat exchangers used with these engines, but the pipes have to be shortened to enable the muffler to fit inside the rear valance. Vintage Speed also do a very nice set in stainless steel, but they are quite expensive. \n<br>\n<br>You can also get shortened 411/412 heat exchangers (CSP I think), but again these are expensive. However, you will need to figure out how to provide an air supply for these to function properly. \n<br>\n<br>I went round in circles over this issue but in the end I got some bespoke stainless headers made by a local firm. \n<br>\n<br>I'll post some pics later which may help.",
