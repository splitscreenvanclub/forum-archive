    "content" : "We've done a few weddings this year so far, but it was on the return journey (fortunately not on the way there), that I pulled over to phone home , just to let Trina know how long I would be as it was a 160 mile round trip, when i started Mr Bo up again, it sounded like the exhaust was blowing, I had a quick look but couldn't see a hole although could see exhaust gases blowing from the front left hand side of the engine. I decided to gently nurse him home &amp; on sunday morning had another look, difinately no hole, but the presure was on as we had another wedding today &amp; a wedding Fayre tomorrow. I called over to Carl at Beetlebank to see what he could find &amp; he found one of the head bolts was a little loose, hence the gases escaping there, knowing how desperate I was, he agreed with my help to drop the engine immeadiately, we found a tiny return on the oil delivery ring on piston 3 was missing explaining why we had issue relating to that, but then found far worse, there was a tiny chip out of the top of a valve which had caused erosion near by, but then looking inside we found carnage, the inside was melted &amp; fu*/:d. A quick call top James at Stateside &amp; he agreed to work late to \"Hemi\" machine a head to get it couriered the next day. It &amp; a complete set of stainless valves, rings etc arrived on Wednesday, built up &amp; back in by Thursday, tested &amp; picked up on Friday &amp; safetly completed Alice &amp; Olivers wedding today just as planned with Mrs Bo Jangles transporting the bridesmaids &amp; brides Mum. So a massive thank you to Carl.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412028.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412031.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412001-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412017.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412021.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412024.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/AliceOliver210412023.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
