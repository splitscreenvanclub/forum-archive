It is too short a distance from the spring cup to the end of the ball and therefore pops out of the socket. The shifter off a 66-67 has a longer distance at this point and should solve the problem. I was expecting them to be the same length overall but this shifter is shorter overall. Can anyone confirm if the shifter in a 66-67 is indeed shorter?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks",

The replacement front shift rods say they cover 62-67 but I don't see how its possible when the gear stick on a 62-65 is the shorter version. The 66-67 shifter sits right into the ball socket. When you shift gears how smooth is it?",

I could select all the gears but it would pop out of the socket in 4th. I can now get all gears including reverse. 1-2 tends to be really smooth but 3-4 is a bit harder. Maybe it will be better once the box is refurbished too",

I got a empi gear stick from GSF which has two adapter plates one for each size. This was a really quick and easy fix. Ten minute job, bargain at Â£70 . Plus you can flog the old gearstick on eBay.\n<br> Cheers Colin",
