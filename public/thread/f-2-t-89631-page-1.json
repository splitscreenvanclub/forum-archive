    "content" : "I have just returned from a awesome canoeing/kayaking weekend at Symonds Yat on the river Wye (with my family). I have to say, even though it was pretty much winter time, we had a BALL! Yes the water was a bit cold but the fun factor and paddling/rowing far outweighed the weather! All this got me thinking… How cool would it be to have a SSVC activity weekend at this venue in the summer!! Anyway after further investigation I meet a really nice chap called Ian (sorry can’t remember your sir name fella) who runs the place, it just so happens Ian owns a split screen bus so what follows was inevitable! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br> \n<br> If anyone is interested I am contemplating organise a camping weekend at the venue next year. Wyedean have camping facilities right next to their premises with toilets etc, plus there are several restaurants, tea rooms, bars and hotels within 2 seconds walking distance (in particular the Royal Lodge hotel if you want to treat yourself as we did \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">) Ian has said that if we do decide to do the weekend he will give us all a very special deal (can’t ask more than that!).\n<br> \n<br> So… if this type of weekend tickles your fancy, please reply to this post so that I can decipher if it’s going to be worthwhile me trying to get this off the ground, please check out the website and see what other activities are available. Remember, you don’t have to do everything, if drifting leisurely down the river Wye in a canoe ticks your box then just do that! if you want to kyac the rapids and get wet, then do that, it’s sooo.. your call! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://wyedean.co.uk/?gclid=CNvr8PzRq7MCFczHtAod3VwAOw\" class=\"postlink\">http://wyedean.co.uk/?gclid=CNvr8PzRq7MCFczHtAod3VwAOw</a>\n<br> \n<br> Location:\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=356135&amp;y=215954&amp;z=115&amp;sv=356135,215954&amp;st=4&amp;ar=y&amp;mapp=map.srf&amp;searchp=ids.srf&amp;dn=546&amp;ax=356135&amp;ay=215954&amp;lm=0\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=35 ... 15954&amp;lm=0</a>\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Rikki.",
