This would result in a bus capable of 100 mile range and more than enough power to push the splitscreen along.\n<br> \n<br> Please let us know if we can help you any further.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> So, for £21k / £25k you get to drive no further than 100 miles, and have no heating / no windscreen demisting... think I'll stick to the fossil fuels until Mr Tesla's products become more mainstream so the price is at least half that and the range is greater.",

That's where fuel cells offer hope.\n<br> \n<br> I've heard suggestions that battery cars could have exchangeable battery packs. Drive up to a service station and just swap your discharged pack for a charged one. I can't see that working though. If you imagine how many battery swaps a service station would need to do each day, they'd need to be huge to store all the batteries.\n<br> \n<br> Toyota (or Honda?) invested heavily in fuel cells, but their customers want a solution now, so they've switched to a battery strategy, which seems short sighted. Taking a long term view; unless the charging issue is resolved, I see batteries as an intermediate step to tide the car industry over until they can get a practical fuel cell solution. Either that, or we're going to be stuck with range-extending fossil fuel/electric hybrids.\n<br> \n<br> Or get the train \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">",
