sliding mechanism seemed to make sense with what we were doing. once in though they just sat way too high, the goal after all is to make it more comfortable for rob to drive with his 6'7 frame so lowering the seat was job one.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/1000ny/media/IMG_2924_zpsb13bd8d1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img

to make our own seats so measurements were taken and this was fabricated.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/1000ny/media/IMG_2928_zps5140a8bf.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img

class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>the curve of the frame would allow it to still give the seat a nice wide base but still sit nice and low to the panel.\n<br>\n<br>next was to find an appropriate sliding mechanism so with tape measures in hand a trip to the dismantlers was embarked upon. we found that a vauxhall zafira was a good contender, the sliders were very thin and very long, giving us a good range of movement. we cut all the unnecessary gubbins off of the sliders and tacked them onto our new seat bottom.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a

the tops, our original plan was to make one ourselves again but after stripping the fabric from the zafira seat and lining it up it seemed perfect so we tacked it in place and gave it a go.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/1000ny/media/IMG_29431_zpscd13ba2d.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img

and were more than happy with the results we fully welded everything together, fabricated new brackets for mounting the seat back, welded strengthening plates in the arch panel to hold the seat

want the seats to look as old school as possible whilst still giving the support and flexibility of a modern seat. so, lowbacks are definitely what we need for that. the lumbar support will be provided by the shape of the lower section of the zafira seat. we don't need the top section for anything or god forbid, head rests! so the seat was cut down by a few inches and a curved section welded in for reinforcement.\n<br>\n<br>at this point we also fabricated a mechanism for operating the slider locking pins. it sticks out of the left of the drivers seat and you simply pull the handle up, this pushes down on the locking catches in the sliders, lifts up the locking pins and the seat slides freely. when we are doing the finishing touches to the van this will be sent out and chromed to form a nice old school feature. \n<br>\n<br>our aim is always to carry out these custom mods in such a way so that no one who didn't know theses vehicles well would be able to spot it wasn't
