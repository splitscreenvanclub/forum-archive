    "content" : "Slow on the update front but been cracking on.\n<br>\n<br>Wednesday got roof flatted and in white. Got bitten by the dust in the garage eaves as this got disturbed over night by the wind so a few bits to sort.\n<br>\n<br>Thursday flatted back cargo area and cab giving this area its final coat, now is just polish up.\n<br>\n<br>Friday was a few hours flatting back above swage line, back, sides and front and prep for saturday. Then hit the pub meeting up with markp &amp; Graham who were off to ninove. Was really weird seeing lots of busses but not having my own there. Found myself drawn to shut lines, edges and trims. Having spent so long doing my own found myself wondering was I right .\n<br>Cracking evening catching up with the gang.\n<br>\n<br>Saturday painted all above swage line and all popouts then moved outside in the sun flatting back cab doors, valance and engine lid sneaking some white on the cab doors before calling it a day.\n<br>\n<br>Sunday and last day in the cave for a few days &amp; with upholsterers visiting Wednesday eve spent a few hours getting floor in. Used 12mm ply as wanted something with a bit of meat to screw into. The ply I seam sealed to floor so should be solid once it cures.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/E53D0994-544E-455D-9374-D58C4640D8A2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/E53D0994-544E-455D-9374-D58C4640D8A2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Then wrestled our new seat in, as felt it needed to be in for measuremnts. We replaced the thin ply that was supplied to some 18 mm, reason being to make fixing easy as I can just drill and screw through plus it makes whole thing more rigid. We also exstaend seat base by 3\" as it then gives us a 6ft bed so no dangling feet out the end.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/5172AA00-67B3-4A89-86C9-5836606C0736.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/5172AA00-67B3-4A89-86C9-5836606C0736.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Handy old 9\" hollow blocks added some weight to the joint.\n<br>\n<br>During the build knew to be carefully on adjusting door when on axle stands so thought I had solved issue as blocked always on the beams making sure bus was always level side to side and front to back. Doors were spot on but alas now on wheels rear cargo door had dropped. So glad I checked prior to paint but a few tweeks and there again.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/D6551FE7-0289-45AD-91F3-1EA839882F7F.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/D6551FE7-0289-45AD-91F3-1EA839882F7F.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/5A967E62-2E18-4D8F-81C1-4DDC93337073.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/5A967E62-2E18-4D8F-81C1-4DDC93337073.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Sorted front headlight bowl's that were catching light chrome surround, bit of an arse as front was ready for colour so a tidy up required but all fitting good now.\n<br>\n<br>Final part of day flatted back roof, cleaned up and prepped bus with some cave modification to stop any unwanted dirt dropping through.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/01F5822C-1DDF-4C80-A8C3-C0F4120025F8.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/01F5822C-1DDF-4C80-A8C3-C0F4120025F8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Final colour is now on roof and so far so good on roof covers.\n<br>\n<br>That's me laters..",

Whole world dropped as door now didn't fit right. Had spent ages gapping it &amp; it catches on inner section for some reason.
