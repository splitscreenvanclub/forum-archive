I recently bought an iPhone and when I synced it the only music is that which I've bought so all my CD collection hasn't transfered. Yet another example of Apple behaving like @rseholes and trying to force you into only using them for everything. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee \n<br>\n<br>Ps have you tried switching it off, locking it, unlocking it, switching it on then hold the centre and (I think) bottom left. This usually re sets mine but I might have the order wrong, if you google it you should be able to find the correct sequence",
