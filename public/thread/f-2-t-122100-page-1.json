Its a family van that we use all the time with the kids and its beginning to look tired with scratches, marks and a few small rusty scratches coming through. Can't afford a respray. Was just thinking a high polish but not sure. Want to basicly protect it and clean it up. Any advise on products. Or what is best to do. Cheers.",

I did exactly the same thing with good results. I’d reiterate that preparation is everything- paint magnifies flaws rather than cover them up. If I did mine again, it would not be in the winter months - too cold and you get a bit of orange peel.\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20180622/9fd8fb2127abbbf6ddd2663decdc6657.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro",

I’d love to have the confidence to give this a go myself so can I just ask what experience you have of body work prep and paint and/or is it something you think those of us without could pick up and achieve a reasonable job without (allowing for practice of course but not everyday work)? I’m not thinking show and shine but the ability to undertake some work knowing I could also prep and paint would be fantastic. Also how good is the environment in which you worked. I have a half decent garage but like many it is full of spiders, dust and leaves at times so I’m just wondering what you do to get around this. \n<br> \n<br> I guess I need to find someone locally who has had the confidence to give it a go and go and ask some questions/see how it is done. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Steve",

I didn't polish using an electric buffer. I found that too easy to burn the paint (which mean a sand back and respray). I used a mop on an air driven, 6 inch orbital sander. Takes a bit longer but you are not going to burn through the paint. The 3m stuff can go on without water which is much less messy and it's way better then 3G.\n<br> \n<br> Get your filler primer from somewhere decent, the stuff I bought on ebay was very thin.\n<br> Try to put as much paint as you can on the edges\n<br> \n<br> If you aren't going all the way back to bare metal and you just have some paint and some bare metal; this is when you might get finishing problems. What looks and feels like a smooth transition between metal (or your then primered bits) and the old paint won't be! When you paint it and polish it you'll see those bits.\n<br> I used stopper to fill those areas, sand then stopper again then a third time if you really want a good finish.\n<br> Ideally you'd lay down a guide coat and sand that back to check for dips. This is all much harder on a dark colour, white is much easier as it doesn't show imperfections as badly. Both my cab dorrs need redoing because they had a lot of filler put in badly and I removed it all and started over. I did them first and they have a lot of dips which nobody notices but me!\n<br> \n<br> A halfway decent spray gun helps a lot with the finish as well but you could put cellulose on with a roller and flat it back to a mirror shine, it would just take longer! You don't need to spend a fortune though. I used \n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000ROF32Y/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\" class=\"postlink\">this</a>\n<br> If you use a mini gun (and I found this much easier to get a really good finish with) be aware that it's laying on much less paint than a big gun so put on loads of coats.\n<br> \n<br> No lacquer, cellulose doesn't need it so it's pointless, also it can yellow. You can't put other lacquers on cellulose. You pretty much can't put any other paint on top of cellulose.",
