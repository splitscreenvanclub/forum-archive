There's no rodding eye in there either (although I could dismantle the 4\" pipe) I'm going to fit one, which is difficult in itself in a roof void whilst trying not to fall through the ceiling below. I will put an accessible rodding eye in but that means drilling through a wall using a core drill so I've go a bit to do.
