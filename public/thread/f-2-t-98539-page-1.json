    "content" : "It seems that there are a few of us getting various busses from these guys. This should give a very clear impression of how this company works.\n<br>So far the consistent feature is that the pictures provided of the vans, which is our only way of checking what we are buying, are not detailed enough or they are of different vans from the ones where the deposit was paid. This has been explained away by just being very very busy, and there is confusion as to what van belongs to what customer while it is in the red-primer stage of the refit.\n<br>I will keep this going to see how this all pans out !.",

I think it's been blasted with an industrial machine not knowing how to do it.. The RHD from Chris here in the UK looks exactly the same and that one has been blasted badly and warped all the panels.\n<br>\n<br>I think it's a fair price if it was an original Salesflap but the flap itself is definitely not original and my guess is that it is a RHD Highroof with a homebrew flap..\n<br>Having said that, the price is a little high if you include shipping to the UK for a standard RHD..",
