All you need is a spark plug wrench and a big screwdriver to change it - the former to undo the nut on the gennie, the latter to lock the pulley whilst you do the former. \n<br> If you take a spare, then if it does go, it's a simple 2 minute job to replace it.\n<br> Get a spare at any VW shop - T3D, C&amp;C, Heritage, KK (probably twice the price), Volkspares, etc...\n<br> \n<br> Andy",

When you say \"stretch it to fit\", I assuem you are not trying to put it on without removing the nut on the alternator pulley and removing half the pulley ?\n<br> If you aren't trying to do this, then do you know that the tension is adjusted by changing the number of shims used ? Adding more shims between the pulley halves will loosen the belo, and removing shims from there will tighten the belt. Usually spare shims are stored under the dished washer that is the first thing to come off when you remove the nut",

Not in my experience - the pulleys are the same size, and the position of the pulleys is the same. Thus, the belt is the same... I'll gladly be corrected on this, though, if I am wrong",
