The curve of the wardrobe should sit on top of this and as in mine before I got hold of one, there will be a gap until you get one as all buses were coverted form kombis and microbuses not vans and thus, will have this level to which the wardrobe was married up to. I don't have a headrest cushion so can't comment, but will take some more snaps tomorrow and post them. make me a list, my legs are aching!!!!!!!",

Do Scofields sell them?\n<br>\n<br>Does anyone have a cover for a bulkhead going spare please?\n<br>\n<br>Ideally I need one pretty soon so it all gets painted at once!\n<br>\n<br>What I'm interested in photos of please is the interaction between the wardrobe and the top of the bulkhead. The plan is to fix a harness bar across the top of the bulkhead and this needs to be placed such that it won't interfere with the wardobe when I fit it. I'm also concerned that if there is a cushion fitted to the wardrobe, that too should not foul ont he harness bar. I'm hoping my gibberish is clear enough that you'll not need to be running in and out of the garage tomorrow too much!\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks for your help - it's much appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Dave",
