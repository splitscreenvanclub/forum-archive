They have a record of all cars that left the german factorys. It tells you when your VW was made, what extra's it came with etc etc.\n<br>\n<br>You can get one here. \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://automuseum.volkswagen.de/urkunden.html?&amp;L=1\">http://automuseum.volkswagen.de/urkunden.html?&amp;L=1</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br> Very helpfull when registering an imported bus. \n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br>\n<br> Nick",

It's only under 6-7psi of pressure at the most when it's idling. It's an old one that I pulled off somebody elses car. Had been on there for years between the fuel pump and carb. Guess it's been glued well.\n<br>\n<br> I had put it on there to find a fuel starvation problem, turned out my T-piece that splits the fuel for the carbs had a bit of something blocking it. Probably from when I changed all the fuel lines earlier this year. Anyway, all sorted now, brand new single fuel pipe between the pump and t piece.\n<br>\n<br> Have you experienced them split before then Paul? I've never seen one. Seen plenty of knackered fuel pipes perished beyond belief and seen batterys cause fires.\n<br>\n<br> Learn something new everyday.\n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br>\n<br> Nick",
