    "content" : "Well, after my steering box went into full melt down, I decided to bring the planned steering rack conversion forward. It’s of the home brew style using a MKIII VX Astra manual rack (with the intent to upgrade to a power rack later), T25 Bevel Box, and various other VW parts (and one other VX part!) …\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1248.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …I started by stripping everything out, the steering wheel came off much easier than last time…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1243.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …one of the issues faced when doing this, is the possible relocation of the master cylinder, one thing I hadn’t considered was the reservoir filling hole?? …\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1244.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …up in the air then, and this is the first proper look I’ve had at what’s been going on underneath through the winter salt…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1245.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …one things for sure, the Rustoleum isn’t up to the job, some remedial work will done in the spring, but I plan to have it blasted and coated in something more appropriate at some point, over coated in white of course \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">.\n<br> \n<br> Most other things have stood up well…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1246.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …but this is annoying, all the ball joints where brand new when installed, and this one already has a knackered boot.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1247.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> On with the conversion then. Most conversions I’ve seen use 3 UJ’s, but usually between the bevel box and the rack requiring the use of a block bearing. After I’d offered up the bevel box I found I could clear the brake master cylinder by using one between the steering column and bevel box, that way negating the need for the block bearing. These UJ’s are from a 1303 and are usully in one piece, I’ve cut it in half so I could use one either side of the bevel box…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1251.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …this was the position I wanted to achieve…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1252.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1253.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …and it should clear the master cylinder nicely…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1254.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1255.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …I saw no reason not to use the things I already had, so the old steering box gave up it’s bracket to the cause. Here it’s already trimmed and a new piece added…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1256.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1257.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …bevel box mounted…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1258.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …not as high as I would have liked, but then I’m no scraper…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1259.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …this is the position of the shaft off of the UJ as it comes through the floor. It looks off centre, and is to the hole, but not to the original column position which wasn’t central…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1260.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1261.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …as I’m using the donut from the T25 column, the hole needs to be bigger for clearance…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1262.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1263.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1264.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …plenty of room for the column flange…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1265.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1266.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …staying inside, I needed to able to cover the donut with something and mount the column sleeve to it, I’d hoped a Bay window column sleeve bottom would work, and it nearly did, it needed some modification to add some clearance. This is the top of one having some extra height added to it (there’s a whole one in the background)…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1267.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1268.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1269.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …trimmed to the floor shape, and a flange added, sorted…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1270.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1271.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …painted and installed that’s the inside done.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1272.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1273.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> With the need to mount over to one side to clear the master cylinder, the nearside mount was very easy to do. The rack rotates in this mount so orientation was also easy…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1274.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …working out the orientation with the VX Vectra UJ mounted to check for clearance…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1275.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …in this position, it clears the master cylinder, cross plate, handbrake cable, clutch cable, and gear shift rod…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1276.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> …one convoluted bracket later.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1277.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> It was at this point I discovered the possible reason for the steering boxes untimely demise, the spindles where seized almost solid!! The steering had creaked a few times, but I thought this was the s/box. Anyway, the spindles went back to my mate Matty to be sorted, having both top bushes replaced. After a discussion about how it may have happened, and possible precautions against it happening again (I’ve never read about it before!) I decided a moisture cap was required, the result being this…\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1279.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1278.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I finished it today, and after a test drive will NOT be upgrading to the power rack, I simply don’t see the need. The steering is light and very responsive, with non of the oversteer I got before. I still need to get the tracking done too.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1280.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I didn’t take any pics of the bracket that gets you from the rack to the steering arms, not sure why, but will next time it’s in the air, what I did do though was use Bay window ball joints.\n<br> \n<br> I’ve lost the horn push from the centre of steering wheel.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
