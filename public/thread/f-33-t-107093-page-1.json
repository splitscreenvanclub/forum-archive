I ask for a pic and his reply was 'you know what a towbar looks like..' \n<br> He wanted me to drive two hours each way to pick up something without knowing what it looked like or what the condition was like or whether it was even a genuine Westy item. We all know that people have different standards of condition and some people over sell there items lol.. Seriously how long does it take to snap a pic\n<br> \n<br> My first rant in the forum.. any good? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",
