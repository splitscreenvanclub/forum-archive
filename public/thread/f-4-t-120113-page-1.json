Pic as when I got it, looks like it was removed carefully and pretty solid. Any more pics wanted let me know.\n<br> \n<br> In good condition and looking for Â£350\n<br> \n<br> Cheers",

Zooming in on your one it looks good, but can you confirm this? Do you have the shelf underneath? Im in Cambridge, i could get a courier to pick up. Thanks, John",
