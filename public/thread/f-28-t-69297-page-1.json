    "content" : "Despite not actually getting to the strip this year, I've been busy preparing for it.\n<br> \n<br> Just had the bus MOT'd and they have modern weight sysyem as part of the brake test. You put it on the two parallel runners and then go backwards and forward's, braking on the forward runs when requested. Cool for lowered cars as there are no issues with dropping down onto the brake rollers.\n<br> \n<br> Best bit though is that tells you the vehicle weight.\n<br> \n<br> My bus was 1252 kg, me in it (well there's 95!!) and a basic camper set up (rock and roll bed and overhead cupboard), plus a bench seat and table. Plus the odd curtain and sleeping bag!!\n<br> \n<br> I thought it would have been way more than that!\n<br> \n<br> Have you lot had your's on the scales?",
