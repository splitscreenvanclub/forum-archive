    "content" : "Hi, I'm looking for some advice on garage doors. I need to get a bit more head hight when my garage door is open. I have a conventional up and over metal door, which takes about 8cm from the top of the door frame when open. I need those 8cm to fit a bus shaped object through. I've looked at sectional doors that could give me full clearance through the door, but the ones I've seen seem to need more internal head height than I have. The door opening height is 210cm with only 21cm on the inside from the top of the opening to the ceiling. Swing out doors are an option, but will take some of the limited width I have. Any thoughts? Thanks",

I've found one that requires much less headroom, if you don't go for the motorised opener, but it still needs a smidge too much, maybe the low headroom kit is the way to go. Thanks",
