    "content" : "<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>grant wrote:</cite>Really nice 66 for sale jump in and enjoy. Really dry bus from Arizona. \n  <br>The bus has had some typical repairs done by the previous owner who had \"restored\" and converted everything to 12V before i got it. Although not factory original, and a long time ago everything works and the bus is fully usable.the paint isn't show winning but presentable for next show season and it seems all door jams are original paint. \n  <br>\n  <br>The bus comes with a recently rebuilt and strong running 1641cc engine with approximately 500 miles.\n  <br>The motor is a AS41 Dual Relief case tapped for full flow and was professionally cleaned, crack checked, and align bored @ .20. NEW main, rod, and cam bearings, lifters, Engle 110 cam, rebuilt German rods, Mahle pistons w/ Grant rings and rebuilt heads w/ high-rev springs. Has the doghouse style oil cooler, original Bosch 009 distributor, NEW fuel pump, Bosch Blue Coil, and alternator. Rebuilt dual 34 Weber carburetors, air cleaners and Interstate battery. Fresh oil change and currently running with hi-quality Brad Penn oil, and NAPA filter.\n  <br>\n  <br>Recent mechanical work (since August) includes, NEW brake shoes, KYB shocks, fuel line, filter, clutch and clutch cable and accelerater cable and rebuilt steering box\n  <br>\n  <br>Exterior work: installed NEW original style Sundial shade awning/tent and side curtains, repainted bumpers, NEW head light &amp; tail light lenses and windshield wipers . Tyres are in good condition and have approximately 70-80% thread remaining and includes 1 spare. Overall the rubber on the bus is in decent condition and most was likely replaced when it was restored previous. The vinyl logos on bus were applied in 2009 and could be removed easy by buyer. Roof rack has been re-stained and is also included.\n  <br>Westy windows and mesh in place..fuel gauge even works..front cab area really clean..\n  <br>Interior: NEW seat belts front and rear, knee guard, grab handles, sunvisors, re-dyed curtains, replaced carpet, ABS front door panels, super nice rubber mat, fully cleaned and upholstered Sundial interior. The camper windows, tables and fold-down bed all function as they should. The water pump is missing the spigot and does not work, but the ice box is in good condition.\n  <br>This bus will take you anywhere and a great candidate for a little tinkering over the winter \n  <br>Open to offers \n  <br>Genuine enquires lets talk\n  <br>Shipping no problem\n  <br>Grant\n  <br>07774269025\n  <br>Viewing on the Wirral northwest UK.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg4_7.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg4_7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg3_8.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg3_8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg1_14.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg1_14.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg2_11.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg2_11.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg10_2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg10_2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg8_4.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\">[URL=http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg12.jpg.html]<img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg8_4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">[/url]\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg5_5.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg5_5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>u\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg13_1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg13_1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg14_1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg14_1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg6_4.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg6_4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg9_3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg9_3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg1_15.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg1_15.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"http://s22.photobucket.com/user/grantdaw/media/image.jpg2_12.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b347/grantdaw/image.jpg2_12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n </div>\n</blockquote>",
