    "content" : "rusty, your ride will be crap if you've only got adjusters on the front to lower it so that its level with back (probably 3.5\" lower), as the suspension geometry has changed so much from standard. Drop spindles will give a much better ride, although they need even more maintenance than an undropped spindle. You will also probably not be able to use an 80 profile tyre with dropped spindles, or even a 70, unless you narrow the beam (to me, narrowed beams just look pointless). You don't have to run as low as 3.5\" down, even with IRS: there are ways to raise it back up a bit, hence your front may not then need dropped spindles: it could be mildly lowered, say upto 2\", in which case adjusters might be ok. Either way, really good dampers are essential: but they won't improve your current ride much. I assume your bump stops are already cut off. You really need to decide what wheel/tyre combo you want, and do some measuring up to see how much tyre travel you'll have before they hit the floor pan (unless you want to go to the cost of tubbing) with whatever lowering device you want to use, then you'll be able to get the right length dampers.\n<br>I think i'm right in saying some people have fitted R9D double wishbone, but no one has put pen to paper after living with it for even a few months. Take from that what you will....ade",

Current set up, other than the steering being all over the place (link pins are bad), my bus is a bit bumpy but no arch rubbing or turning circle loss. I also have to consider the fact i want disks and a servo soon so;\n<br>\n<br>1. How low will i need to go on the beam to keep the look and will this seriously compromise ride quality?\n<br>2. What options do i have (outside very pricy kits) for disks on an early bay BJ beam? are these better than the options for amy K&amp;L?\n<br>3. I have seen dropped spindles mentioned in the thread for a BJ beam in the US, anyone have experience of them as a way of maintaing ride whilst lowering?\n<br>4. do i just sit tight, do the link pins, live with the ok ride and stump up for a VWJim servo and Willwood brake kit? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks guys.",

I don't want something that's in the weeds - it needs to sit nicely lower than stock but still be practical as a family camping bus, handle ride and stop well (ideally discs on the front, maybe with a servo too?).\n<br>\n<br>I've priced up the \"traditional\" approach ie dropped spindles, narrowed adjustable beam on the front, shorter shocks and a spline change at the rear, but having read this thread it looks to make more sense to go with the Red9 wishbone upgrade, given it's not that much more expensive, has great reviews from owners and also has the benefit of rack and pinion.\n<br>\n<br>So here's the question in a nutshell; starting with a stock late split van and a buget of say, Â£3k where would your money go?\n<br>\n<br>Red9 wishbones with late bay discs on the front + servo, one spline at the rear, or should i just save some money and go with just dropped spindles (+discs) given its only having a mild drop?",
