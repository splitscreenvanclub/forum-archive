    "content" : "hello all, after being part of the final fling 08 and 09, thought it best to try a show/event with a difference...\n<br> \n<br> Oldtimers Cruize Devon......\"it'll be just right\" \n<br> \n<br> ..........pre 67 busses only! ............30 vehicles ONLY!............\n<br> \n<br> just to let you know, i am aiming this event at all types of us...... single, couples and families etc... so what i have been trying to do is get us all catered for. the cruize will include some live music, good pubs that do good food, clean campsite (showers etc..) maybe a bouncy castle (if the kids are good), maybe another good pub, good likeminded people that enjoy their own and others vw busses and all in north devon... can you just imagine 30 busses cruizin.. around and through the villages.... (it's gonna be great!!! jk)\n<br> \n<br> criteria.... it would be wise to have your bus all serviced up ( there are some entertaining roads, all of which i would be more than happy driving my old 59 up and down). mums and dads are responsible for their own children. the cruize is all about start to finish, so you would need to be able to participate from start to finish (thurs 27th may @ 2pm till monday 31st may) early vw busses only .... (unless there are spaces left closer the time)\n<br> \n<br> what's included...\n<br> thursday 27th (with a full tank of fuel) we will leave junction 27 M5 then cruize to a campsite in north west exmoor, where we will pitch up for one night (elec available). there is a pub nearby which will lay on some live music and they do good pub grub, so after a long day on the road you can let your hair down..(remember we are back on the road in the morning). \n<br> fri morning aim to leave site 10.30/11am we all will then cruize west, taking in some great views and some interesting lanes (very picturesque). then arriving at a village pub for a spot of lunch, get back on the road and head over to our local vw specialist who has laid on some entertainment (food and beverages also available). we will pitch up here also just for one night, (basic amenities, portaloo and running water only). \n<br> sat morning aim to leave 10.30/11am head back towards the coast, this is time to refuel..(next daytime stop not finalised yet), after the day showing off..... in someway or another we will head to the next campsite via the supermarket to stock up. we will stay here for the final 2 nights (good campsite facilities, hot shower etc.). there is a bar on site, but the way i see it is you do your own thing for the first night, there are a few good pubs around the best fish and chip shop in the South West in braunton. \n<br> sunday morning leave site for a day our location/car park still not decided (because its a bank hol the owners do not want to play ball!!) but wherever we go (beach etc..) plan to stay there for the day. late afternoon cruize back to campsite, get freshened up ready for the last blast!!!! in the onsite bar (remember driving home the next day!!). NOTE food and beer are NOT included.\n<br> \n<br> hope you understand and like all the above, i know there are a couple of daytime places that still need sorting so i will update as soon as i know.\n<br> \n<br> now for the not so exciting bit..... i know funds are tight, and with an event like this we all have fuel, food, beer and general expences ontop of ticket price. so i have tried to keep it down to a minimum ( considering it's a bank hol weekend), the price is per split screen bus, ( 2 adults and up to 3 children) for 4 nights camping and entertainment. Â£78.00 \n<br> \n<br> if you are still interested and want to be a part of the O.C.D , there are only 30 spaces available, (including mine), first come first in!....... please email \n<a href=\"mailto:buzz1959@btinternet.com\">buzz1959@btinternet.com</a> subject \"O.C.D im in\". with your details (names, bus reg and who's in your bus). to register. so if you want to be part of the coolest cruize in devon, get registered..\n<br> \n<br> cheers buzz and look forward to seeing you all.\n<br> \n<br> 1st edit..\n<br> also a few people have asked if they can join up later on the thursday because they either have to work or there children are at school..... this will be ok as long as we know who will need to do this....\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/buzz1959/ocd1060.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
