    "content" : "(Note: taken just last week, Saturday, 13 July 2013)\n<br>\n<br>This week was productive as far as my restoration is concerned. Last Tuesday, I spent half day block sanding the long side panel considering that there are \"paper thin\" depressions. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086567.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>this is the long panel after hours of block sanding using 220 grit and followed by 400 grit!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086566.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Please take a closer look and you will find a \"paper thin\" depression between the 1x2x24 aluminum hallow block I am using to measure all the minute depressions and the panel. Take note that when you view the panel from the sides, the very very thin depression may be visible but when you rub your palm onto it slowly, it seems that there are no depressions. So I addressed this because it annoys me knowing that the panel isn't that straight.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086568.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>After applying the fillers, I used the 1x2x24 aluminum hallow tube to scrap the thick fillers on the panel to achieve the desired thinness of the fillers that should be left on the panel for block sanding.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086573.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>One the 1x2x24 aluminum hallow tube has been used to scrap off the excess fillers, you can immediately see the amount of fillers that is left on the panel that is so straight to the current panel. I did this procedure everything that there were \"paper thin\" depressions. And it wasn't easy because I had to see the panel from the sides and it is becoming so difficult to see the \"paper thin\" depressions as soon as there are so many fillers on the panel.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086575.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>After I have applied the sealing wax red (which turned out to be okay), I applied he chesnut brown color (I just needed to see that color on the split! I am pretty much excited to see how it will look!), and I cover the dashboard with the used bed sheet to eliminate possible sprinkling chestnut brown paint. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086569.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Of course, the used news papers are always helpful!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086576.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086577.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086571.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Finished one! That panel is the best result I have had in 6 months, and I am so much happier seeing that panel that straighter compared before!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086570.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The chestnut brown look blackish while it was still drying up but when it is completely dried up, the brown hue became more apparent!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086572.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086574.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>When I woke up Sunday morning, I immediately checked the split and the chestnut brown became so visible compared to the time that I just finished painting it!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1086578.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>A closer view of the front end! The split may look cool on these pictures, but in person..... still long way to go, especially the waist up chestnut brown color. Although the sealing wax red is 90 % finished, and the remaining 10% is still even more toucher... \n<br>\n<br>Thanks a lot!",

I started the restoration myself last week of December 2012. And I am restoring the split only every weekend, particularly during Saturdays. So basically four days in a month. Although the body was already caused to be repaired by the previous owner. So, I am just continuing from where the PO stopped. But restoring it isn't a walk in the park because, I am not a painter by profession. But the restoration gives me satisfactions and removes all the stress from the long week of work. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks.",

    "content" : "I applied the Chestnut Brown paint last weekend. Although I had some adjustments on the hue of the color by adding little of orange, and the brown is more apparent now that the first time i applied it.\n<br>\n<br>I need your input on the hue of the brown buddies. Whether it is okay now or I have to add black paint to that the hue of the brown will go darker that this one.. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1095832.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1095833.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1095834.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1095835.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
