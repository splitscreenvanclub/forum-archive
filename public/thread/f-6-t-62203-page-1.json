    "content" : "Hi,\n<br> \n<br> I am working with 66 DC and after weldings SA or IRS will be modified for that. I have heard rumors about that there is an issue with tyre removal if I will go real low. How low You can go without serious problem? I would like to meet rear fender slip to center cap of the Fuchs at rear, front is easier if I have understood correctly.\n<br> \n<br> How You have handled this? With adjusting plates? Does it make difference with SA or IRS, same issuue?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks,\n<br> Petri",

    "content" : "Hi Petri rear wheel removal is pretty tricky on lowered buses adjustable pring plates do help a certain amount depending where the springplate is positioned on the splines and how much adjustment youve used on the adjusters....\n<br> currently im running notched plates on a lowish bus check my thread in the readers ride section....\n<br> the trick i use to get my rear wheels of is as follows\n<br> undo lower shock mount bolt place a scissor or bottle jack between chassis rail and axle tube then pump till you can get the wheel off !!! do this with caution as the spring plates are under tension\n<br> best solution ive found when working in my garage\n<br> \n<br> for road side issues id carry a can of tyre weld if your dealing with punctures\n<br> hope that helps\n<br> Sean",

Is it going to be more harder with 205's? Like I told I am not yet able to try rim/wheel combo until weldings are done and transmission is installed.\n<br> \n<br> Also adjustable spring plates needs to be purchased.\n<br> \n<br> Petri",
