    "content" : "Before putting it in the \"For Sale\" section, I need to get a value. Sorry if this is not where I should post this, but once I decide a price that is where it will be put and I don't to post on there without a price and mess people around.\n<br> \n<br> The story is that I have been offerd a very nice '59 in Mango and seagul, nice motor and full sorted and my heart has always been on the earlier bus.So, with heavy heart I'm thinking of selling my 64 Kombi.\n<br> \n<br> Some of you will know the spec and I've spent some serious money on it (and I don't want to think how much!!but it's well into the 20K's) so although I realised I will not get all of this back but want to see what I am likely to be asking for it.\n<br> \n<br> Spec:-\n<br> \n<br> 64 Velvet green Kombi (was Light Grey but was painted in the 70's). California import by Steve Gilbert at one on one.\n<br> \n<br> Paint faded over time, some area's shiney, some satin. Panels replaced are both bottom rear corner's and battery tray's, inner and outer cargo doors and sill/inner/outer/strenghtener. Steve G special of adding 10mm to front arches to look like earlier ones. All then painted/washed in, in Velvet green with Matting agent. A few marks and dint's but very solid and period looking. Look's it's age.\n<br> Ratty US spec bumpers. 2 x Karmen Konnection 2 and 3 bow racks, faded to the same to suit.\n<br> \n<br> Trimming Tonic interior as this bus's first owner was Chris Lyons. Brown Tartan with Velvet green strip in it. Looks great. All around a Westy style, Light oak woodwork.\n<br> \n<br> VW speedshop supplied, MAC built 2110, very high spec but all new with H beams, CB case, CB CNC round ports, FK7 Cam,new tinware, 1.4 rocker's, manton pushrods, Jaycee tube's. You name it.\n<br> \n<br> Ranch pro-street box, sway-away driveshaft's. All straight axled. 3.88 final drive and longer 1st. built to hold the next...\n<br> \n<br> CB Efi/Turbo easytune set up. Full engine management, currently running 10lbs of boost (it can go much higher!!) and kicking out 170 hp at the wheels so just over 200 at the flywheel. Messa oil cooler and Charge cooler system so it runs nice and cool. The lot 200o miles old.\n<br> \n<br> Drives like a nice strong bus when off boost and really liven's up when the turbo (T/T4 Hybrid) spools up.\n<br> \n<br> CSP disc's to stop it and a dual crt system. Drop spindles too. CsP shifter, Autometer gauges.\n<br> \n<br> Flat 4 Enkie 5 rim's (immaculate) with 165/55/15's on the front and 195/60's on the rear.\n<br> \n<br> Not quite stock but looks it form the outside!!(bar the stance and rim's).\n<br> \n<br> I've also got a full set of safari's/pop' out from Creative for it too, including the rear screen. Not fitted but could be included.\n<br> \n<br> So any idea's on how to work out it's worth??",

There is near on 10 k in the running gear in this if you was to buy the bit's and pay someone to bolt it together properly. But I'm realistic too, what it's worth is only what someone is prepaired to pay for it.",

    "content" : "I think using a valuer is sensible. Here's some amateur observations I've made over the time I've been (rather obsessively) watching the \"for sale\" section:\n<br> \n<br> - stock is always worth more than modified if the van is in good/excellent condition\n<br> \n<br> - rare models always fetch more (naturally - supply &amp; demand!)\n<br> \n<br> - OG is always a good selling point\n<br> \n<br> - you never get your money back for the restorations/modifications made - i.e. its always cheaper to buy the van with the things you want rather than to do it yourself (this seems particularly true for engines)\n<br> \n<br> - it's a buyers market at the moment: sellers are often lowering their initial asking prices\n<br> \n<br> The price ranges you suggested seem par for the course for the current market, but there may be aspects of the bus you can highlight to justify a higher price bracket.\n<br> \n<br> Here's a morally low point, but I suppose one worth making: you may get more selling to bus \"newbies\" who lack a reference point, for example through ebay or other off-site pages. \n<br> \n<br> Good luck with the sale.
