    "content" : "I remember my dad had an accident in 1968 in Fortwilliam, when we lived there in his split. A bin lorry ,driver ......, cut across his path with no warning to go into the depot. Dad got his legs trapped and had the majority of his false teeth smashed. I remember him in hospital, not a pretty sight. Dont mean to upset or worry people but it happened, I was there, and I now enjoy drivin a split and dont even think about it anymore. False teeth in 1968? I hear you think. Well, my dad had all his teeth removed when he was 17. His philosophy paid off. He's been to the dentist only three times in his lifetime and is now 84yrs. Think I might do it myself. Think of the savings my boy or dont you know.",
