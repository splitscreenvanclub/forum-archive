    "content" : "Whats the point if you can earn more or the same money per day than a Restoration service would cost. I'm sure we all don't mind doing the odd job on the van to keep it on the road, but a IRS/Engine/Front end/disc brake/ new loom and electrics install is out of my skill set. I can however drill an oil well, so why don't I do that and let the professional restorer do the restoration. \n<br> \n<br> Saying that I am currently on company number 2 as No1 i have found was a con artist and couldn't wire a plug let alone take on a VW mechanicial restoration, so I could have done just as good of a job if I was not a \"Cheque book Resto man\"\n<br> .",
