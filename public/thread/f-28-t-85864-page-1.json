Im running 9.8 CR and and FK8 cam and CB 044 heads with 42 inlet / 37.3 exh.\n<br>\n<br>If no maps are available then I would also really appreciate advice also. As Im in Jersey its not as easy as going to my local rolling road..!\n<br>\n<br>The ECU is a wolf v4 3D but im happy to adapt a map from any other ECU manufacturers also.\n<br>\n<br>So who can help me??\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance, Andy",

Gave up on using MAP as primary load very quickly due to ITBs...\n<br>\n<br>I tuned this without a rolling road but to do this a wideband AFR (I'm using an Innovate LC-1) is _essential_ along with decent engine instrumentation.\n<br>\n<br>Having said that I wouldn't trust my map at maximum load as it is difficult to operate at that performance point in a lightweight Chesil. I imagine a bus would operate at higher load sites more readily.\n<br>\n<br>I'm currently away in asia on business but might be able to send you something next weekend when back in the uk. You'd be able to load it up on the (free) DTA software to take a look.\n<br>\n<br>Let me know,\n<br>\n<br>Simon",
