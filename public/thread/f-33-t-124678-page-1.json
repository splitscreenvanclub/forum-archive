Or is everyone sick to freakin death of the news and media constantly talking about the same thing over and over again, I swear if I hear PP frigging E again I’m going to bin the tv. I’m also very frustrated by the presenters (Probably at the direction of the production teams) constantly berating the government, I’d love to hear their bloody solutions, alas it’s easier to pick on them having hindsight. Grrrrrr, can’t wait for this to be over so I can go camping again with no tv, no connection to the outside world. Rant over",
