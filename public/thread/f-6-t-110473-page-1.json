    "content" : "I’m having trouble with the bus. Problem is that now and again she will just die. When the ignition key is turned the lights dim and nothing happens. I have recently changed the ignition switch, the battery, the starter and added a hot start relay. When she does turn over she fires up without issue.\n<br>\n<br>So, I am thinking about:\n<br>• Running a new wire from the ignition to the starter as I’ve no idea of condition of current wire. It may be 50 years old and shorting somewhere.\n<br>• Running a new wire from the fuse box to the coil as I have no idea about this wires condition either.\n<br>Any other suggestions are appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>Finally, what gauge /amp wires should I replace the above with??\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Keri",

    "content" : "Keri, \n<br>From your description I seriously doubt it is the cables; much more likely a connector or connectors on the ends of the cables. May I suggest you check (with the battery disconnected) the push on blade connectors (assuming it is a post 1961 van) on the back of the fuse-box, and focus on the thick red cabled connectors especially, and make sure they are all a tight and secure fit.\n<br>Then check the state of the connectors onto the starter motor solenoid and focus on the several cables on the input M8 threaded stud terminal. Again make sure they are all absolutely clean and bright, and use a new and bright washer and nut if necessary.\n<br>Most electrical problems are generally much easier to resolve than they seem at first! Hope yours is too!\n<br>Peter Good",

    "content" : "So...\n<br>\n<br>I've cleaned up the contacts on the battery and earth strap and I'm having the same troubles. With that in mind I looked at the earth to the coil (from the fusebox?) and this particular cable has perished near the engine. I replaced a section in the engine bay but the problems continue. What I don't know is the condition of the cable from the engine to the fusebox? \n<br>\n<br>As it happens a little while ago (I had forgotten I had done this) I ran a a 6 core cable from the front gauges (oil temp, rev clock, oil pressure) and I've only used 4 of the 6 cables. My plan is to use one of these cables as the coil earth from the fuse box to see if that eliminates the problem. \n<br>\n<br>Its so frustrating as she will purr for a little while then start bogging, backfiring, generally running like a bag of s*&amp;t then purr again or cut out and she may or may not restart as there might be nothing when the key turns...\n<br>\n<br>Out of curiosity, where else would their be earth wires to check for corrosion?\n<br>\n<br>Failing all of the above then I may just bite the bullet and replace the loom, 50 year old cable is bound to perish eventually.",
