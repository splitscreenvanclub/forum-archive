    "content" : "<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br> \n<br> OK, been having problems with my fuel tank in the crewcab. Every morning and afternoon, theres been a strong smell of petrol in the cab for a few weeks. After a quick spin with the windows open, the smell goes away.\n<br> \n<br> I fitted a new fuel cap from C&amp;C a couple of weeks ago thinking the old one was leaking. However, this has made no difference.\n<br> \n<br> Yesterday, after leaving it out in the sun during our club dinner I found a big patch of fuel under the bus when it was time to head home so finally today I drained the tank and pulled it out.\n<br> \n<br> The seams are fine all the way round as I left a couple of litres in the tank and have had it stood on all 4 sides during today with no visible leaks/pools of fuel. \n<br> \n<br> When i took the tank out, only the top of the tank has fuel stains apart from one corner where the fuel has dripped over the lip onto the floor.\n<br> \n<br> I'm guessing the problem is there is no breather pipe/hole so the fuel vapours are expanding in the warmth down here and forcing the fuel out through the sender seal.\n<br> \n<br> The new fuel cap has a new cork seal but appears to be pretty much airtight as when I was draining the tank I noticed the flow of fuel was slowing down and when I opened the fuel cap, the flow increased.\n<br> \n<br> So, thats the explanation but what can I do to stop the problem?\n<br> \n<br> I find it crazy that there is no breather pipe. I've read on here that the original VW filler caps were breathable! If thats the case.... how? And if so, i'd really be no better off as the fumes would still make there way into the cab under the back seat.\n<br> \n<br> I'm a bit confused to say the least \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br> \n<br> Any ideas anyone?\n<br> \n<br> Please \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

    "content" : "Well, I took the tank out this week to have a gander.\n<br> \n<br> The first thing I noticed was the fuel stain all over the top of the tank down to just above the seam.\n<br> \n<br> I left a couple of litres of fuel in the tank and left it on its various sides for about an hour each side. There was no sign of leakage around the seam anywhere.\n<br> \n<br> I removed the sender unit and was surprised to discover the mating surface that sits on top of the tank was badly distorted into a wavey pattern. Is this normal or should it be perfectly flat?\n<br> \n<br> Looking at the tank staining and the sender unit and knowing the cap that came on the tank was non original and non breathing I've come to the conclusion that my problem has been vapour expansion in the tank being unable to escape in the warm weather down here and forcing its way out through the sender unit seal (very old and brittle)\n<br> \n<br> As I needed to get the bus down to the storage facility today before flying back to UK for xmas I had to put it all back together using a new homemade sender seal and plenty of silicon sealant. I also drilled a hole in the new C&amp;C fuel cap (btw, C&amp;C say their replacement caps do breathe if used with their cork seal. I can tell you from experience that if you really crank on the fuel cap, they don't breathe at all.......be gentle \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> )\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, after filling the tank back up and driving for 10 mins the smell of fuel in the cab is as bad as ever. This is more than likely due to the hole in the fuel cap (remember in a crewcab, the tank is directly behind the cab and not in the engine bay so fumes can get into the cab quite easily under the back seat.................and yes, i did put new seals on the partition panels before refitting them \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> )\n<br> \n<br> However, I also think the sender unit is goosed and letting fumes/fuel out, despite my best attempts at sealing it.\n<br> \n<br> Stupid question before I go any further \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">...............In a crewcab, should you be able to see into the fuel tank space through the filler flap or should that be completely sealed from the outside. ie,the fuel filler neck has the neck seal around it and all in situ but I can see around the metal support plate into the space where the tank sits! Is this normal or do i have a panel or2 missing? I really should have taken a piccy but like a dumbass, I plain forgot \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br> \n<br> If it is normal, I find it strange that VW would design something so petrol fumes would vent directly into the space occupied by the tank.\n<br> \n<br> At the moment, I'm leaning towards replacing the whole lot with a Fairbank and Craven ali tank with built in breather and a pipe leading well away from the cab, new sender and non breathing filler cap. Has anyone have any experience with the fairbank and craven tanks? Are they built to a standard etc etc.\n<br> \n<br> All advice welcome. I use my crewie everyday and cart my baby daughter around in it to kindergarten etc etc so it needs to be safe \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
