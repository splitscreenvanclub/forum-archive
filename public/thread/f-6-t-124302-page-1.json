    "content" : "Hi,\n<br> I’ve replaced the crappy repro brazilian carb on my 1600 single port ex industrial engine with a rage rebuilt solex pict 30/3. I’ve also had to fit a spacer because the previous owner has converted the bus to 12v and added an alternator and split charge. The spacer allows the carb to clear the alternator. The engine originally had a Mann mushroom type filter that I’m guessing came with the industrial set up. This filter will now not fit as it fouls on the engine room roof. I’m hoping that the original type oil bath filter would be a better fit. There is an air filter bracket mounted to the right hand side of the engine bay. \n<br> \n<br> I’m sure I’m not the first to come across this problem so can anyone point me in the right direction or does anyone have the filter I need please. \n<br> Thanks in advance jay",

    "content" : "I would start with correct year filter 1964? and work out if you can get that to fit with the spacer? If not then you may have to find a decent welder to cut n shut the mount to take out the excess somewhere. One thought is that you fitted a standard depth spacer? Could you reduce the depth of the spacer to the minimum depth to clear the alternator? Or is it really close already?\n<br> \n<br> Late splits did not even have an alternator as standard so I do not believe there will be a standard one?\n<br> \n<br> First car I ever had with an Alternator was a 1971 Canadian mini with machine sensed charge! Boiled the battery unless I had maximum draw from battery!",

    "content" : "Haha! I’d happily go back to 6v and a dynamo but as we will be needing the split charge I’ve got to try to get this set up working. I’ve been looking for the ‘64 on filter for a while and I’ve been offered one for £100 which is going to work out expensive if it doesn’t fit! Yes I agree I might have to get the spacer machined down to make it work. I’m thinking it’s just the clearance directly above the carb that will determine if the og elbow will fit. I’ll have to get a photo and some measurements. Thanks for the help",

(not me at the moment..)\n<br> I see spacers sold for alternator clearance are said to be 3/8'' or 9.5mm. Some say 10mm..others are sold at 6mm for thermal insulation. So may be you could buy an off the shelf silution?\n<br> Like all these problems...the solution may be to steal a little bit here n a little bit there!",
