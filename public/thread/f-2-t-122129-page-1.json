I would like the van to be a safe as possible as I plan to drive it most weekends and my kids are already asking if they can take van to festivals which I donâ€™t mind as I want it to be used as much as possible.I would like to hear from as many members as possible on the different possibilities out there. \n<br> \n<br> Thx terry",

As a newbie to vehicle restoration the \"no cutting\" option appealed and everything came new.\n<br> \n<br> I can't compare to any other makes though.\n<br> \n<br> When I took off in France over a huge bump on a road, towing my Puck, everything landed safely and in a straight line........testament indeed.\n<br> \n<br> If I had my time again, I would have everything powdercated as they had problems with the zinc coating and mine has suffered......\n<br> \n<br> Ask Simon about the handbrake modification and mount the rear calipers with the cables entering from above so that they don't trap water.\n<br> \n<br> Happy to have a chat with you if you want....pm me.\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
