If you apply it, let it work and scrub off the black coating, you can use it to remove rust, but there are probably more efficient ways of doing so. If you apply it and leave the black coating, that coating acts as a rust inhibitor - it's ferric phosphate.\n<br>\n<br>It helps to mix it in to a gel e.g. by adding wallpaper paste, but that gets messy.",
