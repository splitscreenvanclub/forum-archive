    "content" : "How do Sean\n<br> \n<br> I fitted \n<a href=\"http://www.futbus.com/Brake-conversion-kits/Wide-5-front-brake-conversion-kit.html\" class=\"postlink\">this kit</a> from FutBus earlier in the year. Worked out a bit cheaper than CSP at the time, and they seemed to have a good reputation - performance-wise. The bearings and seals are standard parts, and the calipers are VW fittment (not sure what off though \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> )\n<br> \n<br> The 15\" won't fit stock 15\" bus wheels, but fitted my SA Sprints fine, and the 15\" beetle spare.\n<br> \n<br> There were a few niggles when fitting - they caliper mounts for a bay first time around meaning the calipers were 3mm out of alignment with the disk causing interference issues, but they sent the right ones out once the issue had been discovered.\n<br> \n<br> Also the wheel bolts needed a couple of mm shaved off to prevent them clipping the caliper - they did tell me this would probably need doing after I'd mentioned it to them. You can now get them with studs (as in the pic on the website) to avoid this.\n<br> \n<br> They seemed to have sorted the grease seal problem that Jim and MarkFer encountered.\n<br> \n<br> Engineering and performance-wise they're good, it was just the human aspect that let things down a little - wrong bracket and communications etc.\n<br> \n<br> Really pleased with them so far, performance is great even without a servo. We've probably done 6000 miles since fitting them in March without a single problem - they give you a bit more confidence on long/steep hills \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> And there was plenty of them in Europe \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> Cheers",
