    "content" : "I did the City &amp; Guilds Level 1 MIG course at my local college and it was a total waste of money. They might as well have named the course 'teach yourself to weld'. That may just be a reflection on the college/course I attended, but if you're starting from scratch with no prior experience, you need a little support and practical tutoring to learn and that was conspicuously absent.\n<br>\n<br>With hindsight, I wish I'd just bought a decent hobby welder for the same price as the course and some scrap steel and taught myself at home. I'd have learned as much, if not more, with the help of a bunch of YouTube videos and a forum like \n<a href=\"http://www.mig-welding.co.uk/forum/\" class=\"postlink\">Mig Welding</a>\n<br>\n<br>As it is, I'm &gt;Â£300 down and don't own a welder.",

LOL\n<br>My advice was there are only a few variables to play with.. to control the welder.. feed speed/ current/ gas etc..\n<br>\n<br>as above ^^^^^^^^^^\n<br>Maybe first watch you tube and get some scrap and try it out..\n<br>Make sure your gas does not run out or the wire is not rusty... or the feed wheel is not worn..\n<br>\n<br>Get the safety gear and do not look at the arc... you'll get arc eye and a very sore eye.. Just make sure you have all the safety kit..\n<br>\n<br>James built a Locost kit car from scratch as a school project..\n<br>Once he had mastered MiG he bought a Chinese Tig set and made inlet manifolds/ exhaust set up out of stainless...",

    "content" : "I did a few courses in my college 5 years after I started welding my own cars. Level 1 city and guilds is all based on 3mm steel and level 2 was all based on 10mm steel. It 100% made me a better welder when it comes to fabrication work but there was no information that helped with vehicle repair.\n<br>Body work is 0.9mm, structure (sills pillars etc) can get up to 1.2mm and chassis (on vws) is 2mm. On these thicknesses (especially 0.9) you can not run a seam of weld. You must build the weld up with evenly spaced tacks to avoid heat build up which will lead to distortion and holes. When welding 3mm you can just run the welder on a mid power setting (depending on power of welder) start at one end and run to the other.\n<br>If you want a welding qualification then go to college. If you want to patch your sill then have a go yourself, watch some YouTube videos, chat with friends/family/neighbours who weld, if you want to tackle your own restoration and want to do a good job of it then research panel beating/vehicle restoration classes, I think Leeds college do a few weekend course's. They are usually at the practical classics restoration show in Birmingham NEC if you want to speak to them and get an idea of courses available, cost etc.\n<br>I hope this helps, never be embarrassed or scared to ask questions if you ever get stuck, we all started at the bottom and worked things out as we went along. Better you ask and learn from someone else's mistake than ruin what your working on!",
