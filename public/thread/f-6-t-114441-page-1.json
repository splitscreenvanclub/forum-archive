    "content" : "Good advice to cover end with rag or foam rubber just in case. \n<br> \n<br> I just did a tank replacement (should have taken photos at the time, but in the heat of the moment didn't think!) \n<br> \n<br> Fuel exit pipe &amp; nut should be fitted to tank after tank is in position but not strapped down. Seemingly impossible to put tank in position if the exit pipe is attached and you can easily lift the tank enough to attach the exit pipe and tighten the nut. \n<br> \n<br> You need to get the filler neck on the correct side of the overspill pipe (on the side nearest hole) and twist the tank so the tank top is towards the tailgate as much as you can. Filler neck forwards to the hole and the other end angled towards the rear in order to feed the neck through the hole. Definately need to get the filler side of the tank as close to the hole side of vehicle body as possible - I had split charge relay on that side and it was impossible without removing the relay - that 1\" made all the difference. \n<br> \n<br> I also found it helpful to have a friend outside with a short stick/part broom handle to guide and push the neck down to get it through the hole. \n<br> \n<br> The sealing rubber was easy enough to fit from the outside after tank was in but don't clamp the tank down until you are happy with the positioning of the sealing rubber regarding space between top and bottom of the neck.",

If so, buy the Wolfsburg West tank (Autocraft stock it). It fits perfectly...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_0803_zpsu014nqgq.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> What you've said above about the filler neck being short suggests that the tank that you have is totally wrong and someone rigged up a neck extension to make it reach the filler hole (I think people who fit bay-window bus tanks have that problem).",

Behind the tank is there a ridge that I assume covers the axel etc and the tank sits in front of this. If you look at the picture of mine the previous owner has sat it back so the filler neck doesn't line up but if its in the correct position it will i guess?",

The tank should sit on what would have been the cargo floor, if the truck had been built as a bus (if that makes sense?).\n<br> \n<br> The outlet from the tank should sit over the oblong cutout that is just to the right of the gren plastic bottle in your picture. A foam piece insulates the tank from the floor at that point to stop it rubbing and stop crap coming up through the hole.\n<br> \n<br> It's not clear in your picture, but looks like you're missing the mounting plates that should be welded to the cargo floor (\n<a href=\"https://klassicfab.com/klassicfab1/en/265-fuel-tank-mounts-single-cabdouble-cab-\" class=\"postlink\">https://klassicfab.com/klassicfab1/en/2 ... ouble-cab-</a> and the hold-down straps (the inch wide straps that wrap over the top of the tank in my picture).\n<br> \n<br> You also need the components of the divider (top hat section at the top, lower separation strip across the cargo floor, divider up the middle and the two removable access panels). Not sure how many of those parts are available though.\n<br> \n<br> Are you rebuilding your truck to standard spec or fabricating some sort of custom load bed?\n<br> \n<br> If you're rebuilding it to stock and you've not already found the Obsolete Air Cooled Document Project - OACDP - you'll find it invaluable for finding which parts you need...\n<a href=\"http://www.oacdp.org/5867part.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.oacdp.org/5867part.html</a>.",
