    "content" : "I am in the process of setting my van up for a larger engine and i have just mounted my oil cooler. I thought i would post it up as there isnt an awful lot of visual help on the forums about mounting coolers and 'scoops'. Hopefully this should help others when they come to fit theirs. \n<br>\n<br>I have the added difficulty of having under belly pans due to the double doors. Therefore restricting the room to fit one. I also run the bus as low as i dare so cant get away with hanging it too low :S\n<br>\n<br>So here we go...\n<br>\n<br>This is the area i have to play with. In between the torsion tubes and the first chassis rail.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01879.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I am using an Empi 72 row oil cooler with fan. I have 3 'U' clamps that mount one plate to the torsion tube and a simple right angled bracket mounting it too the chassis. Then there is a scoop that should aid a bit of extra air flow at speed.\n<br>\n<br>Here is the cooler and brackets off the van...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01872.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01875.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01876.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>here is the brackets when fitted...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01883.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01885.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>and with the cooler...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01887.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>and scoop...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01901.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/russellpeace/DSC01913.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Im hoping the scoop isnt too low as i may end up hitting it... i took it out yesterday with the brackets and no cooler just to see if it hit anything... no problems... but i dont know how i will come off if ran over something... i probably only have a few inches of clearance. I may end up changing the scoop slightly.\n<br>\n<br>hope this helps anyone trying to find somewhere to fit theirs. \n<br>\n<br>Please, if you could add your comments on here too, it would be much appreciated (positive or negative). As i said at the beginning, i wasnt able to find anywhere about mounting coolers, what it looked like when fitted or what can be classified as a 'scoop'. So i have no idea if this is what has been done in the past etc... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Peace!",

    "content" : "I will be running a 2332 blown motor so could do with as much flow through the cooler as possible. I also plan on doing alot of european trips during the hot summer months so I want to ensure max cooling.\n<br>\n<br>I was worried that the speed of the air passing over the cooler at 80mph wouldn't be able to be sucked through, hence the scoop. Also a few people have already advised me to do this. It's all removable anyway. And it doesn't mount to the cooler itself, it just fits to the bracket. Worst comes worst, the bracket will catch and fold backwards anyway. \n<br>\n<br>I was going to run it with and without and see what difference it makes first. Will be interesting to see the effect on oil temp.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for the feedback though, I am worried about catching it so I will only be putting it on if I need to \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Peace!",

Being a structural part of the bus. Cool solution tho if I could get away with it. How did you duct the hot air back out? And did you take the oil lines through the chassis or under it? Would be good to see some photos if you have any. \n<br>\n<br>Like I said before, there are very few photos of peoples installations on here to get an idea of what to do.\n<br>\n<br>Peace!",
