I tend to hang on to the paper ones unnecessarily after I've read them, probably out of respect for the amount of effort that goes in to producing them. Eventually they end up in the recycling though.\n<br>\n<br>Soft would be better for me and an archive in the member's section would allow us to find old articles.",
