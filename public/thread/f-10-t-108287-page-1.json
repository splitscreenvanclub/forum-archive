This is not a show as such but a get together\n<br> with like minded people, enjoying what the island has to offer, there will be no food or trade stands,\n<br>We have secured an area at one of our local campsites, which has all the normal facilities. Shop, \n<br>restaurant, pool, Etc. We will have a marquee for socialising and music\n<br>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.campingjersey.com/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.campingjersey.com/</a>\n<br>\n<br> Dates for the weekend Friday 5th to Sunday 7th June, obviously if you wish to \n<br>arrive earlier or stay longer it wont be a problem. There is a lot to do on the island, \n<br>places to visit, and amazing beaches. \n<br>\n<br> This weekend coincides with the Jersey International Festival of motoring.\n<br> We hope to organise an area at the show to display peopleâ€™s buses if they wish.\n<br>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.jimf.je\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.jimf.je</a>\n<br>\n<br> Ferries are from Poole on the new fast Catamaran or on the conventional ferry from Portsmouth.\n<br>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.condorferries.co.uk/offers/view-book-your-2015-travel-and-save\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.condorferries.co.uk/offers/view-book-your-2015-travel-and-save</a>\n<br>\n<br> Hope to see you there",
