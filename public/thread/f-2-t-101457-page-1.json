    "content" : "I sorted my insurance this week for my 63 Deluxe. Tried RH after hearing good things but to be honest the guy i spoke to didn't fill me with confidence that he knew what he was talking about, and Adrian Flux then undercut them by £14. On top of that, the AF policy included £2k of cover for contents PLUS £1k purely for camping equipment (awning cookers gas bottles etc) as it is a specific campervan policy. As a comparison, the RH policy covered only £100 for contents which is nowhere near enough if you're away camping with all your kit! AF doesn't have breakdown cover but already got AA so it wasn't a deal breaker! \n<br>\n<br>My advice, definitely shop around but be aware of what you are getting and not getting with each. In my case I got more for less!",
