Its not getting fuel the plastic filter only has a little fuel in it and when I'm pumping the accelerator I dont really smell any fuel.\n<br> I'm fairly certain it must be a fuel pump failure - Its currently a Brazilian one &amp; just want to check if that sounds right, before I go and order one.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks",
