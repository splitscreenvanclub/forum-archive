    "content" : "so I had nearly a full day on it today, \n<br>\n<br>I started by stripping and cleaning everything, - I did it by using engine cleaner and a jet washer, - no access to an ultrasonic cleaner unfortunately so it will have to do.\n<br>\n<br>I added the new correct bearings and checked out the alignment for the oil ways - it wasn't great , so I added a small area of chamfer to aid the oil getting to the bearings correctly . if you see the pencil marks that's where the oil passageway comes out so the chamfer was neede to allow the oil to get to the passageway \n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_154907.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_154907.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>so this is what ive done - I hope its ok? \n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_160825.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_160825.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>it was necessary on two bearings, the one by the flywheel and the one 2nd in from the front..\n<br>\n<br>then I went through the case and de-burred everything. \n<br>\n<br>I decided that next up was to build up the crankshaft timing gear \n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_164047.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_164047.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_165229.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_165229.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>then I added the camshaft bearings ( double thrust) and offered the crankshaft and camshaft. all was well\n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_171515.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_171515.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>then I added the oil pump ( a 30 mm ) to check that the camshaft bolts cleared the oil pump - well it didn't so I ground these down and refitted them to the camshaft with thread lock to make sure that they don't come loose.\n<a href=\"http://s28.photobucket.com/user/caveman774/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_171912.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c231/caveman774/Mobile%20Uploads/2015-04/20150411_171912.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>that's about where I got to today, ill have another go tomorrow",

It becomes a rapid learning curve when it comes to deck heights, cc's and compression ratios as that was a mine field.\n<br>\n<br>On mine I used my original heads &amp; barrels which were good but after developing a crack between the valves 10k miles down the line now find out the deck height was is to big although compression ratio calculated right . who ever originally made that part achieved value by taking loads out of head. I know now but on a first time build getting that info just didn't know and now requires pulling barrels of to get them machined or buying new barrels to get everything back to a STD size if there is such a thing..",
