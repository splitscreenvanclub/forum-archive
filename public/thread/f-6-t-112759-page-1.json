Looking again I only just saw his how too on the rhd conversion! \n<br> \n<br> Interesting though to hear people's thoughts/comparison but if I go rascal it will more than likely be from this Jim dude, I'll drop him a message to see what parts are needed &amp; if its possible on lhd. \n<br> \n<br> I might even get to see a few &amp; have a word at Brighton (..where I will be on foot &amp; leaving my broken van at home grrr!)",
