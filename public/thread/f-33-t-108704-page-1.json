    "content" : "So I had to write to DVLA to notify that my father's car was not sorned (as he had died and it was in storage).\n<br>Imagine my surprise that a few weeks later I got a letter about a car I sold in 2012. It was from intercredit international, they were demanding £80. At first I thought it was a joke, but alas no! \n<br>Turns out they did not get the V5 that I had posted when I sold the car and the new owner did not register it (I think it was broken for spares).\n<br>I have tried writing then appealing to the dvla, but with no evidence of posting (well who keeps postal receipts from 2012?), I had no chance.\n<br>So the moral of the story - Sell a car send the documents to dvla by registered post!!!\n<br>93p is better than £80, gggrrrr!!!",
