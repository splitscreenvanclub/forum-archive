    "content" : "Hi Rob. Bus wheels in both 15\" and 14\" (bay window) had 4 slots around the bolt holes, They are quite obvious on the 15's less so on the 14's. Beetle wheels aka smoothies, had no vents and run smooth all the way around. When people get confused about bus wheels I refer them to this samba link. \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=290000\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=290000</a>",
