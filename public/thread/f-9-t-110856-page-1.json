    "content" : "Chewie,\n<br>No doubt you've been already to the Brecons but we camped at a very nice little campsite called Priory Mill. It's about a mile out of Brecon town itself and located right next to a little river. They allow camp fires (raised fire pits free of charge) and supply wood (at a small fee). A small toilet/shower block and free range chickens roam the place! It's about a 10-15 minute walk down into town.\n<br>Sadly, this year they've changed their policy and don't allow campervans! So you'll need to park up and pitch a tent \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" alt=\":-(\" title=\"Sad\">",
