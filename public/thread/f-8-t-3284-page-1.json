However this ran off-centre by about 5mm and there was a droning noise when I got to 50mph!!! I decided to buy and fit a Scat pulley. This is an excellent piece of kit, it runs true, has allowed me to fit a new belt with no problems and seemingly has made the engine a little more perky!!!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/179604.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
