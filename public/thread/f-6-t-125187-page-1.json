    "content" : "Without the old registration documents; I think VW are your only option to confirm that, but even then the can only tell you if the number is correct, not the engine itself.\n<br> \n<br> If you request the birth certificate; they won't tell you the engine number, but if you send them the number of the engine that you have and ask them to confirm if it's original they should confirm yes or no. Not sure if they'll do that if you just ask for the cheaper 'data sheet', but you could try.\n<br> \n<br> Before investing the money though; it's worth checking if it's in a possible range by looking it up on the VIN and engine number list on The Samba. If the engine number is more than a few months 'older' than the VIN, or it's younger, then it won't be original to the vehicle.\n<br> \n<br> Have a search on the Samba for info on the style of numbers used and the stamps used to indicate replacement/exchange engines too though (the obvious one is a stamp of a circle made up of two semi-circular arrows prefixing the engine number, but a faint rectangular stamp somewhere near the engine number is another indicator). It used to be common to re-stamp an original engine number on a replacement engine. Even if the number is correct, it might not be on the actual engine that was fitted when built.",
