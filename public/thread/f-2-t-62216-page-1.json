    "content" : "We're currently close to completing the purchase of our new house, which comes without an form of garage.\n<br>\n<br>The current owners had planning permission granted to build a double garage in the back garden with road access however they never saw this through and the planning permission has now slipped.\n<br>\n<br>I believe that as permission has been granted once before it is pretty much a paperwork exercise to re-apply (with a fee of course) and have the permission re-granted.\n<br>\n<br>I know that it is somewhat of a vague question, with so many variables, and if's and buts.... but how many pennies am i looking at for a double garage? I'm not looking at something that Jenson Button or Jamie Oliver would store their motors in, but a reasonable building, with a bit of space to be able to walk around the Bus without having to worrying about the belt buckle doing the paint work any damage.\n<br>\n<br>I'd prefer brick construction, with a pitch roof and an electricity supply running from the house.\n<br> \n<br>I'm just after a few figures so that when I start asking for quotes from builders in the area I have sort of idea...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Cheer, Ben",
