I have since bought a lighter Eriba caravan.\n<br>\n<br>I went for this as there is no major damp and fantastic interior, I was going to paint and colour code the outside to match our van.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The caravan is in good condition but if it was me it does need a repaint outside. The current paint job aint the best but the caravan itself is very very straight!!\n<br>\n<br>Electrics are fully working and it still has the original cooker/fridge/sink but have not tested these altho the 240v hook is working perfectly. The leisure battery is dead but could be recharged....\n<br>\n<br>All units are intact as well as the table and a new carpet has been fitted.\n<br>\n<br>It looks to me this went through a restoration a few years ago and new rubber seals fitted all around. The cooker / sink / windows are in really good condition!!\n<br>\n<br>One of the legs is very very stiff and will need attention and the key is missing for one of the doors. There is a spare door included in the sale as well as the following:-\n<br>\n<br>Bin\n<br>Vintage Porta-loo\n<br>Cooker\n<br>Sink\n<br>Cooker\n<br>Bowl\n<br>240v\n<br>Several plugs\n<br>Extra door.\n<br>\n<br>I have more photos available to people and I would say the paintwork most definitely needs attention altho could be used as is!\n<br>\n<br>The caravan is available for viewing and would recommend you nip and see it!!\n<br>\n<br>Â£150 deposit within 24 hrs of listing finishing!!!",
