    "content" : "Just discovered that our 63 from Arizona has a pair of rear shocks that seem to be air dampened. \n<br> There is a valve fitted in the engine bay tray (opposite that main battery tray). I cant figure out who manufactured the shocks and I am wondering if any of you guys know how much pressure should these be inflated to so I can check them without ruining anything. \n<br> Thanks, Paul \n<br> \n<br> They have some writing on them saying: \n<br> 729204 \n<br> Made in USA \n<br> P043\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i29.photobucket.com/albums/c280/paulyana/100_1058.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

You can Set the pressure low for every day use and blow them up when you are gonna carry some thing heavy. I have a pair fitted to my van at the front so I can get over speed bumps without damaging the steering box, they give about two inches lift at 200psi. I think they say keep 25psi in them to stop the air bag from pinching. I have fitted a small compressor and gauge so I can adjust them as I drive. Mike",
