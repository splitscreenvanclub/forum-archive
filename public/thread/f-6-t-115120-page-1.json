The problem is I'm not experienced in being able to asses what state these are in and if I need to replace anything. Can anyone tell me what procedure you use to work out excess play etc, what to look for. Or failing that who I can send them to that has more experience than me to tell me\n<br>Who refurbishes these complete units?\n<br>Steve\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s91.photobucket.com/user/Ukrobotman/media/image_zpsj2fhb7sh.jpeg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i91.photobucket.com/albums/k289/Ukrobotman/image_zpsj2fhb7sh.jpeg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
