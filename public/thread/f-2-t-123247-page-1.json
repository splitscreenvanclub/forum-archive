    "content" : "NFA 19 \n<br> If this interests you, we are a group of split owners who have met up over the witsun break in May for many years. It’s a mystery cruise and camp out in the West Country for a 5 day period. 23rd-27th\n<br> \n<br> This year again is no different where we meet at a campsite which has all amenities and is our base for the duration. \n<br> We have our own specific camping field with Ehu for all, shower block that is designated for our group, bar &amp; restaurant facilities &amp; stunning views.\n<br> Gist of the adventure meet on Thursday 23rd May at the campsite or cruise with others as groups form and just enjoy a convoy.\n<br> Friday leave site 10:30 tour for roughly 1 hour around the back lanes of Cornwall taking in the sites. Destination has a restaurant, activity &amp; sites to see, then tour back later.\n<br> Saturday do your own thing, many go for a surfer or just chill together.\n<br> Sunday leave site 10:30 and again another tour to a destination with several pubs &amp; food for a relaxing day.\n<br> The beauty of the days is the mystery tour and convoy, destinations have food facilities or supply your own. \n<br> Evenings nearly always end in the bar, or a group huddle and drink n chat on the pitch. \n<br> Cost is £18 a night per unit all in which includes occupants, awning and ehu so £72 for duration. If you want to stay longer you can at our discounted rate and many do for an extra day or so which can be added at any time. \n<br> \n<br> If you fancy this and feel your like minded email me and I will give you the details..\n<br> All we ask is you have fun, get involved and use your split. \n<br> We have five places left so be quick as first come first served.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks Bren \n<br> \n<br> To book email..\n<br> \n<a href=\"mailto:brenralls@gmail.com\">brenralls@gmail.com</a> Quote ( no fixed abode 19. ) &amp; I will send on booking details.",
