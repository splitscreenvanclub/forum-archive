    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br> been watching oil drip while my bus is standing cold and it appears to be coming though alongside two of the six sump bolts (the little 10mm ones with the brass washers). How can I fix this? The bolts are only supposed to be torqued up lightly but on these two bolts in particular it seems that it won't tighten at all so the thread must be worn and I don't want to strip them and make them worse.\n<br> Any tips to fix this issue gratefully appreciated!\n<br> Thanks,\n<br> DD",
