Lights are on but indicator need wiring in, but again everything is there ready. \n<br>There are areas of welding needed but this can be done as you go. \n<br>Tyres good but has snow tyres on the front so not sure if legal for UK roads. \n<br>\n<br>Needs one replacement windscreen available at VW Heritage for £59. \n<br>Petrol tank has a small leak after about 2 gallons has been put in but have found one on eBay for £119 item No: 371434722916 (So is a relatively cheap and simple fix) and they are also sold at JustKampers.\n<br>\n<br>Priced for a quick sale and open to offers.\n<br>£11000\n<br>Located in Kent, England.\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n <!-- ia0 -->Screen Shot 2015-09-18 at 22.03.00.png\n <!-- ia0 -->\n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n <!-- ia1 -->Screen Shot 2015-09-18 at 22.02.53.png\n <!-- ia1 -->\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>As you can see from videos van drives and is fully running and as pre 1960 doesn't need an MOT so in theory you could just drive away.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1IoBlBU8mk\" class=\"bbvideo\" data-bbvideo=\"560,315\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1IoBlBU8mk</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ITcRzx3DPM\" class=\"bbvideo\" data-bbvideo=\"560,315\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ITcRzx3DPM</a>",
