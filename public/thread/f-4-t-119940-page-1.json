Re the driveshafts they are standard driveshafts from a type 3 or type 2 from a 3 rib and up gearbox. Re the flexiplate you will have to search for either new or used. Im not sure if a type 25 could be altered or not. You will need to research. The gearbox has not been overhauled there is no warranty. I can get the box overhauled with a receipt and warranty circa £300. I myself recently bought a 6 rib manual box for £800 and spent another £300 on a rebuild myself.\n<br> I hope ive answered ll your questions.\n<br> Regards\n<br> Darren",
