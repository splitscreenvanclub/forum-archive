Well we've been away as a family to the Alps, first winter hols in 4 years as we have been in limbo with Megs surgery for ages, now thats all done and dusted it meant we could plan and go boarding once again, with a new addition though...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/58468903a28b71153eb53383e4e17101.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>20 months and whizzing along already, by day three she was going solo, doing little turns and everything, made my holiday! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/370e3432f99616de627342ea9d6adc1f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Whilst away (I had wifi \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> ) I found out from dad that we have lost our workshop \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> absolutely gutted as we've put a lot into it over the 6 years we have had it. So Ive come home with the wind properly knocked out of my sails bus wise. It took me ages to find this place, so I am a little worried. We might have to pop it all into storage with various friends for a while until we can sort something out. Hopefully we will find a place and get setup asap but the bus will be on hold I think until then, sorry guys!\n<br>\n<br>I may continue with the engine build in dads shed as its all setup for that kind of thing already, but Im not sure many of you want pictures of engine builds as they arent that photogenic are they?!? Let me know your thoughts...\n<br>\n<br>Did a little bit the week before we left, managed to sort the turbo placement so I can still fit the rear closing panel, had to plasma a cutout to clear the pipework, and have yet to find an exhaust that works but Ive spoken to Turbo Thomas so am fairly sure we can do something... \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/64eaf83b0a4eda26ad1db5ab1ddfa9e7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Got clearance all round too \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/e7bc2d56e9d065691ae2a75d92c48472.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/cf1e6fa9aa01f93a3307009cfee5165d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Also finished prepping the other doors so painting those when the weather warms up\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160308/dbe22e0a5f7644b8836a21170fe8d061.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Sorry guys.

It was far too cold though in the workshop and two days after this photo the paint was still fingerprinting badly\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/A11B9FF0-9F6D-4D83-8CE6-90EE0D6FD221_zpsw87h8g3n.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So I had to go out and buy an Infra Red heater, drying slowly now, a panel at a time but at least its drying as I thought I would be stripping it all back at one point...phew!!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/94A7A9F4-4B12-4A69-B121-821BFCF579AF_zpsradz0bgx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The gear linkage, brakes, hydraulic clutch and throttle cable are all in too... The gears are really positive, a massive thanks to my dad for hours spent on the lathe and miller making all of the linkages and bits to make it like this!! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/42663119-76E2-496B-8544-4F8CA3EA0515_zpsvqgm1v9o.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/B6A86EA4-2332-4A8B-B59E-5341B545544A_zpsc7jkdfx9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Thats all stripped now and painted satin black.\n<br>\n<br>So onto the air ride bits, mounted it all on a plinth, and fit it inside the treasure chest now, the tank fits in front and so does a battery so all self contained, the only external part will be the little lcd display under the dash. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/5EA1F8A7-6211-4A9F-9C4D-071F12FDC454_zpsmj7qtzuz.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We are making progress now. \n<br>\n<br>If it warms up a little I may spray the second colour on but we shall see as the first colour left a lot to be desired due to the weather, it ages quite nicely though...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/0E354080-D8B4-4B38-A595-606B045789BC_zpsbpalefsp.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>May get a few hours this weekend, if so I will get some of dads pictures of the engine build too and try to do a combined update.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers for looking guys \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">",
