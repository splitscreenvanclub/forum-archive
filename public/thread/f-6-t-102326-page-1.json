What is the conversion between number of splines and distance moved ??\n<br> \n<br> I need to raise the bus by about 2\", so how many outer splines does this mean ???\n<br> \n<br> Is there anything else I need to be aware of when doing this job ??

    "content" : "phil, there is no easy way to get it out and leave the torsion bar in place.\n<br> \n<br> what i usually do is get a sprit level and score a horizontal line across the spring plate surround and the torsion bar end. Then remove, the spring plate and the torsion bar. Whack the end to get the torsion bar out and clean and regrease it, then put it back into the tube so that the scored line is level. You also have a datum to adjust up or down from, for the outer splines then. \n<br> \n<br> However, I think that 2\" is going to require a combination of inners and outers. maybe +9 / -9\n<br> \n<br> See this matrix for guidance. (Its for beetles but accurate enough for buses as well.)\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.volksworld.com/tech-guides/technical-information/vw-rear-suspension-adjustment-chart/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.volksworld.com/tech-guides/t ... ent-chart/</a>\n<br> \n<br> By the way, whats with raising it up?
