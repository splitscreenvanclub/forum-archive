    "content" : "Work on the van this week has been a little slow, as the welding work has ended and the body work started, as we all know it takes ages to get the panels to look right before any primer can be put on, working on our small garage means working on one side at a time and moving it about when something needs to be done.\n<br>We were able to make good the engine lid and rear hatch along with repairs to the rear apron, the engine is in and it all works fine so moving it around is easier, still leaks oil a bit.\n<br>Looks like the van was originally Burgundy under the other 6 coats of paint, mostly blue's and at one time green, amongst others, also had to knock out a dent in the belt line, repair the N/S window area and guttering drip rail, nice to have some primer on the panels now.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/20141012_183800.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/20141012_183800.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/20141013_125353.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/20141013_125353.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/20141015_131033.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/20141015_131033.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/20141016_130558.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/20141016_130558.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s497.photobucket.com/user/probikesecurity/media/20141018_215111.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr332/probikesecurity/20141018_215111.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
