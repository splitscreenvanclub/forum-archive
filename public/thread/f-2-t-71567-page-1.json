It`s that simple. \n<br>\n<br>You can apply the same principle to welding gussets onto the backs of dropped spindles in attempt to strengthen them once they`ve been carved out - doesn`t work as its the shape/ structure that`s changed - this causes the weakness and you cant compensate for this simply by thickening up the new weaker shape. Nice idea but physics doesn`t work that way I`m afraid\n<br>\n<br>I`m 100% confident that both VOSA and insurance companies would be in total agreement on this \"notching\" principle and would remove such a vehicle from the road under inspection, or deem them modifed enough to undergo a full SVA test (which they would fail misearbly).\n<br>\n<br> I also think that if it was your kid you was killed/mamed as a result of this utter ignorance/stupidity (all in the name of vanity \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> ) that your tune would quickly change and you`d be pushing for the maxiumum sentance possible for the selfish a hole who defiantly gave ever other road user a middle finger just so he could look \"cool\".
