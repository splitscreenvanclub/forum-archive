    "content" : "15 window Split Screen Fleetline body without engine or gearbox. I work as a volunteer in Namibia and will be leaving soon. My plan was to fix this car nicely and drive it back to Holland, but it turned out I don't have time to fix this body. It's in good shape with hardly any rust, so you can transform this car into a real beauty. 50% of the windows are still there. \n<br>\n<br>It's a RHD that is missing its left door. I have two more doors but with some rust. Also have some small parts that I won't be using. The car is parked in Rundu, Namibia and can easily be brought to South Africa. I have seen bodies priced for Rand 30.000, but want someone to have a good shot at a great car so my price is Rand 10.000\n<br>\n<br>Is anyone interested?",
