Like you I was looking for a 'red, red' not dark red or orangely red. AAC seemed to the best or brightest (titian) and seemed to be more rubbery and less rigid than Schofields and another one I found. \n<br> I wonder if they would send you a sample? \n<br> Can't hurt to ask? \n<br> DM",

    "content" : "I am also struggling to find a correct bright red insert trim. I have had 3 different reds delivered from various companies, Titan and sealing wax red seems to be described as bright red but it's nothing like what I am after. I've kinda given up now so it looks like I will be fitting sealing wax red to the Familia I am building, then painting it by hand with red tyre paint. Far from ideal, so if anyone finds a true bright red available please let me know too as I'll need it very soon ... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

I've just measured around the body, and ideally need a minimum of 10 metres? I have a full sealing wax red set And a black length for the lower body trim too. Any help greatly appreciated, have you got a pic of colour? It's very hard to tell in a picture sometimes it seems, hence why I have had 3 different red's so far!! ... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
