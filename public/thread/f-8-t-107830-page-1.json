    "content" : "So the cab floor is out. I'm looking at step box section replacements, small part of the wheel arch and the odd bit here and there. Thanks to Daaan for just advertising 2 complete arches for half their retail money - result \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>While the cab floor is out I'll be switching to dual cylinder brakes. Not technically OG but safety of the 4 kids and greyhound come first.......oh and my Mrs of course...................\n<br>\n<br>It has been noted by someone with far more knowledge than I that my bus is running a 68 Bay front beam so she's sitting a little high. Ad posted on Wanted section for front beam drum to drum. Stock ride height is really important to me so this has got to be right.\n<br>\n<br>With a surprisingly smooth cab floor removal and while I wait for the arches and new floor I thought I'd set about the cargo floor. This flies in the face of my 'finish one area before you start the next' approach but I believe in keeping the momentum and I had the time so onward and downwards! The entire floor removal was a bit of a dilemma as on the whole it was pretty good but for peace of mind, and as I'm replacing both sills anyway I though I'd just do the whole floor. Sourced myself an OG old unused VW stock cargo floor so well happy \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">.\n<br>\n<br>This was a good decision as the cargo door sill, inner strengthener and inner sill all need replacing. While I'm at it I'm going to replace the near side long sill too and inner sill. I also need to replace small sections to both B posts and the bottom few inches of the strengtheners on the near side.\n<br>\n<br>I've removed the cargo floor back to the heater tube so far. I won't lie - cargo floor removal is a back breaker on fairly solid floor - not the cutting but the spot weld removal. The good thing is though it's allowed me to have a good look at the chassis which is solid as a rock so just panel replacement for me.\n<br>\n<br>I've included an action shot. Before you have a go at me for not wearing goggles, I discovered something in the cold unit - I can't wear goggles with my face mask as they steam up! I had three choices - risk my eyesight, risk my throat and lungs or goggle up and grind blind with misty bins Alan Carr style \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>The eyesight was risked, don't try at home kids, and a decent mask is now on the shopping list.\n<br>\n<br>Next step finish removing cargo floor around heater tube, the long sill and inner before cleaning up and switching back to cab floor installation. This will take a while as I can't weld a tank from a nut, bolt and can of beer like BA. Back soon..................",
