    "content" : "After testing my bus over the last few days I have noticed a slight issue.\n<br>\n<br>When it gets above 90 mph or so the steering wheel goes very 'light' like there isnt anything attached to the end of it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif\" alt=\":!:\" title=\"Exclaim\"> \n<br>\n<br>The spindles are relatively new, The tie rods are all top notch the idler pin is fine and there is only a very small amount of play (hardly noticeable, you touch the steering wheel to turn it slightly and the wheels instantly move) which I found is down to the drag link from the steering box arm to the idler arm.\n<br>Where the tie rod end screws into the threaded arm there is no clamp to tighten the thread down (like there is on tie rods) and as a result the thread has worn slightly.\n<br>Im going to weld this up so it solid to eliminate this very minimal play.\n<br>\n<br>Has anyone any ideas on what it might be ? or is this common on vans that are only designed to do 55 mph \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>I dont fancy loosing it at the end of the strip !!!",
