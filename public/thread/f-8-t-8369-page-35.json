We didn't realise until we went to swap over your 200mm clutch. \n<br>\n<br>Sat morning, test fitting the partially stripped 1600 to check the flywheel clearence. Helpers Andy, Brian and Nige are doing all the work here! \n<br>We did the old trick of slowly tightening up the engine bolts, and turning the engien over to let the flywheel grind off any high points. Worked well. Although we didn't have a clutch fitted to it ...\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/BL2FQa\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5824/23470741805_3f71423bc8_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/BL2FQa\" class=\"postlink\">Kombi upgrade in progress.</a>\n<br>\n<br>Engine back out and ready for assembly, so we could do a test fire up using the engine rig Nige had brought along.

What we thought was a dead battery was actually a dodgy earth connetion on the starter. After a few niggles were ironed out it fired right up and sounded great. Result! \n<br>\n<br>So, next job was to get it back into the bus. Easy ... Not. With the clutch on this time it was a ball ache, even with 4 of us! We just struggled getting the shaft lined up properly without the heat exchangers being in the way. We got there eventually but it wasn't easy. Imagine our surprise then when not only wouldn't it fire up, it was locked up solid! We could turn the crank maybe 60 degrees before if locked up either way ...\n<br>After a little head scratching we figured it was the clutch that was fouling the gearbox. Engine back out again, and the bright spots on the gearbox confirmed the rivets on the clutch were hitting where the clutch throwout arm comes through. Arse!\n<br>\n<br>It was a quick fix with the drill, but by now it was pretty late, so we called it a night and went inside to warm up with Susie's homemade stew and dumplings, and to sit around a log fire.",

(in the rain)\n<br>Well, this time I made sure I got it warmed up properly. It was rough after start up, but soon cleared itself. Pulled away nicely. Going well, so took it for a quick blat on the motorway for a couple of junctions. Made no effort of getting up to speed, and cruised happily at 55. Noisy, but the engine temps were a steady 140. Pulled nicely up gradients too. Put me foot down and it soon got up to 60 but was noisy so backed off to 58ish, which it happily held without sounding like it was working too hard.\n<br>Off the motorway it died at junctions a couple of times. Restarted first turn of the key, so think that's just an idle adjustment. Took it up the steepest hill locally as well, which it climbed up in third easily. \n<br>Still a few small jobs to do, but the motor is running well!
