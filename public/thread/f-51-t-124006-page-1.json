    "content" : "I have been asked by the family of Julian Collinge if the SSVC can assist in the sale of his much loved and admired 63 Devon Caravette.\n<br> \n<br> Please take the time to read this thread so you understand the circumstances of the sale.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=123842\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic ... 2&amp;t=123842</a>\n<br> \n<br> From there you will see the link to Julian's build thread, but in case you missed it.. \n<a href=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=83572\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=83572</a>\n<br> \n<br> There is not much I can add to a for sale advert after such a detailed thread showing the extremely high standard of work involved other than to say I saw this van a couple of weeks ago and it is just as stunning in the flesh as in the pictures. The orange awning, boxes of history and a few spares will come with the van.\n<br> The van is located in Leicester, but hasn't been driven since August. I have asked for the MOT expiry date and will update when I get it, I'm not sure with the MOT exemption rules as it has a 1776 engine and twin carbs, possibly the only variation from stock on the whole van. \n<br> \n<br> Price is Â£40,000, genuine enquiries only please as I will be acting as the initial point of contact as requested by Julian's family. \n<br> \n<br> Dougie - 07772059409",
