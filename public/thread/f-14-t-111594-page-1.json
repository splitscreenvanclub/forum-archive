I need to move a splitty and kit car (both rolling projects but will need winching on) 5 miles from my house to a barn I've managed to secure.\n<br>\n<br>Tried a few car transport firms, but due to the short distance either there not interested or they are really expensive (one was more expensive than when I moved another car 90 mies a year back - lost his details though).\n<br>\n<br>If anyone can help it would really be appreciated, if you can pm me.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>David",
