So I got the garage to sort them out and do the retest which it passed, Great news, happy days \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> Neglected to post on this thread and started a Passed my mot thread as you do \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>So with the MOT Passed, it was time to strip it out again ready for paint.\n<br>\n<br>Now, I was going to do the painting myself but Clare begged and pleaded ( told me ) she really wanted a professional job done on it, and to be honest I had to give in...that thumb on my forehead was really hurting ! We had agreed that when we got the bus, It was going to be lowered, fancy wheels, big engine etc etc. But, when we did get it I decided I wanted to keep it more stock. So when it came to painting I thought it was only fair to let Clare have things her way.....Don't get me started !!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>So Clare went off to B&amp;Q to find the paint chits with the colours she wanted . I'd told Steve ( who's painting it ) that I would do the Cargo area inside and Engine bay, as they are not really going to be seen that much. Plus the Cab interior roof and some bits in the Cab. He said well you may as well do all the inside and any bad bits he'll redo, So it was agreed. Now you know sometimes you may just set your sights a little bit hi. Well I have too say after painting the inside I am really glad I'm not doing the outside. Just to big a job for my level of skill...But that's fine, I had a go.\n<br>Obviously I couldn't resist doing the hubcaps, The pic aint great, it's more of a minty/ greeny / turquoisy colour.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0182_zpsc67f9438.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0182_zpsc67f9438.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>This is how they look on the wheel. The thing is I painted the wheels a while a go so the white of the wheel is a brighter white that the top and interior of the bus will be.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/726173Bus_zpsb0044410.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/726173Bus_zpsb0044410.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And I do need to paint the VW recess in white.\n<br>\n<br>So next came the inside, It's not perfect by any means but, I am pretty happy it as a DIY attempt. Couple of runs to sort out, and a couple of bits that I missed giving a good cover to, but all in all, a happy man. And as said I'll get steve to put right the few bits that need doing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/1476319_916472005032587_909420611388796751_n_zps9952c0f4.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/1476319_916472005032587_909420611388796751_n_zps9952c0f4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And the Hubcap against the Interior and what will be the top half colour\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0188_zps9ed7e846.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0188_zps9ed7e846.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The white does look quite bright but it is quite an off white, glad we didn't go for a brilliant white \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0184_zpscc4d44ce.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0184_zpscc4d44ce.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The bus goes in next week for the full spray and polish etc, should get it back towards the end of Feb.\n<br>\n<br>Andy",
