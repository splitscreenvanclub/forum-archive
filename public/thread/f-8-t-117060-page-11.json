So I cut the end end off and replaced with a longer union, new flare and tightened up. Problem solved. \n<br> Pressurised the system again and noticed lots of weeping from various unions, I was obviously being over cautious and not doing them up tight enough, so went round every union again and gave them all a few more turns. Time to bleed the brakes again. \n<br> Long story short pedal kept pumping up and air always in the system \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji848.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> after checking all the joints again, checking wheel cylinders and servo I found the new brake light switch was at fault \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji849.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> went out and bought a new one and another leak sorted. \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170716/2a4192ea43a148d1eed2ed3a8c0e4461.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> Good one on the left crap one on the right (avoid)\n<br> \n<br> Pressurised the system once again only this time the seal in the top of the reservoir blew out, don't forget I'm doing all of this on my back under the bus so I got covered in brake fluid for the second time loosing half litre of fluid in the process. Binned the pressurised bottle and called the wife into the man cave to do it the old fashioned way of pumping the pedal which worked first time so now I have a good brake pedal at last!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170716/040de8d9abe097705bdede965c4ecfc2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br>",

I assumed it was the plate adjustment but after many tries it still wouldn't find 3rd or 4th. I took the gearbox coupling off of the shaft and tried moving the hockey stick in the gearbox by hand but although I can feel the hockey stick click into the 3rd 4th selector it will not budge. Either the hockey stick is not quite lined up with the selector or the selector itself is stuck. I checked all the gears before I installed the gearbox and all was ok but now it looks like I will have to pull the engine and gearbox back out so I can get the nose cone off to see what's going on unless you guys have any other suggestions? \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji45.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
