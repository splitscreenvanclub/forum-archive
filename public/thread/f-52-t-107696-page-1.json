    "content" : "My Oval is reluctantly for sale,built originally by Bill Frost and painted by Carlos Briajas(sorry for spelling) the car then had a motor built and is in the RKC series at Pheonix(see the pictures on the Renn thread on the Lounge.\n<br>It then moved to Cali where it was offered a place in the DKP as long as the Fuchs were detailed I believe these were done by VW Paradise.\n<br>The car then came to the UK where it was entered in the Volksworld show and won best Cal Look.\n<br>Alex Spring then bought the car and it turned out mechanically to be a bit of a mess, the 2276 turned out to be a very pretty but not very robust 2007 with ill fitting tinware with the rear tins missing,susequently it had run very hot and torched the heads.\n<br>So the spending began!!\n<br>Pete Roberts at Funkenblitz,stripped and inspected the case,clearanced it and rebuilt the block with new balanced crank and H beam rods, a new FK10 ,straight cut timing gears, heavily reworked Street Eliminators,new match ported manifolds and new spanish Idas with the third progression hole,new tinware all internally welded and head tins fabbed to suit the larger motor(30 hrs labour in this alone) Ally carb steadys were made and polished and these fit to the fan shroud.The motor has never sucked a gasket! Berg linkage full new MSD and new alternator and welded fan,All new full flow with mocal extra cooler and fan with temp and pressure gauges in custom housing and fan switch in car,although it has never got hot enough to use it.Speed shop 1”5/8” stainless header and muffler cut and tigged to fit perfectly.Also new alternator welded fan and battery and a Funkenblitxz stainless breather tube.\n<br>A new Rancho Pro Comp close ratio box with polished and peened SAW axles with a late front mount fabbed by Funkenblitz a berg mid mount and berg traction bar.The car launches strong with NO wheel hop.Best time was a mid 13 ,on street tyres with Alex driving, In his own words \"and me driving I am rubbish,a lot more in it!\"\n<br>A new 2” under beam with dropped spindles discs all round and a new m/cylinder,with brake balancing valves on the rear lines.New fuel line (dash and a CB rotary pump.\n<br>Interior ,half cage in silver with gusseted plates for the harnesses, race trim high backs upholstered in red tuck and roll with new door cards and drop in seat delete panel,gauges and Monster tach on polished ally mount in place of the ash tray(no holes drilled in the dash!\n<br>Body… Polar Silver, still stunning but with a few small blemishes,still nice enough to win top twenty at the Volksworld show again and best id show at Volks Fest.\n<br>The shell is unwelded and needs none,Alex Taylor at Defcon 3 says it is one of the best shells he has seen ( and he is pretty fussy) The only welding I have found is a couple small repairs to to the bolting lip on the rear wings and there is a very small split on one rear wing.\n<br>The car also won \"Best Modified Aircooled\" @ Limebug open day 2014.\n<br>There it is best part of 30k in the car and without sounding daft you really can feel it when driving the car.\n<br>Best offer over 16k (pounds) buys it ,this is cheap, If you are interested make an offer!Please..no offers of kidneys/sisters/sweets or opinions on the price,this is hard enough to do already.Thanks...some pics.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e89/fleetline15/57%20Polar%20Princess/7931C977-097D-41E2-ABAF-3CB7CFC14C3E-1435-000000CE84B7BB22_zps77cb284f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e89/fleetline15/57%20Polar%20Princess/FA690EF1-65AA-49FC-A092-F2BD915D8243-1435-000000CE7D4C2390_zpse5940179.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e89/fleetline15/57%20Polar%20Princess/FB2D8A5A-C174-434C-9603-B4C33BF8B063-6360-00000385A86F388E_zps5f3e461d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
