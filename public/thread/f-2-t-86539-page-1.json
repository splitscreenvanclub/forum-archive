As I'm imagining they let the cold in? whistle in the wind? and leak when it rains? Although I can image they help when its warm and help with condensation. What's your experience?\n<br>Also interested to see how others have trimmed them on the inside or put open/close vents on the inside?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",
