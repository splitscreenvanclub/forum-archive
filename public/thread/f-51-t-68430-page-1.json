It is 99.9% Complete (just missing mirrors and 1 wiper arm).\n<br>It is also running but there is either a problem with the drag link or tie-rods. \n<br>There is very minimal Rust and the body is still solid, it is mostly surface rust. \n<br>It has original 1500 Engine, that still sounds good. \n<br>Only major problem is that the Nose was damaged and fixed by preivous ownwer.\n<br>\n<br>Pics attached. Only reason for selling is that I might have a crew cab that I want to do up. Panel van is in South Africa. \n<br>If you want to restore it, it will be easy to do. If you require any more info Please let me know.\n<br>\n<br>Looking at R40000(ZAR) or 3500 Pounds. \n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:kuven0107@gmail.com\">kuven0107@gmail.com</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00247a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00250a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00253a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00252a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00251a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00262a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00255a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d18/kuven0107/DSC00254a.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
