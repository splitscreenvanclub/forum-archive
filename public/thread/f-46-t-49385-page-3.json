Apparently he thought it was too flash and never actually used it much. \n<br>Our 67 Devon has its original badge fixed to the tailgate, below the Volkwagen badge. I've seen a couple of other late Devons with it in the same place, so maybe the factory started putting them there in 66/67? The detailed plastic badge is in the same place on the inside of the passenger door - they kept this location for at least the first three years of Bay conversions.\n<br>Just off to choose my next anorak now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
