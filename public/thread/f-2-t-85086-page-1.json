Propane is much more 'searching' than natural gas too(it will leak out of a poor joint where natural gas won't). \n<br> Be carefull. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",

Be sure to use a suitable jointing paste for LPG gases such as Hawk White on all your joints and not PTFE plastic tape. Always test all conections with a suitable leak detecting fluid preferably a spray type, if using washing up liquid make sure you wash off completely after testing. \n<br> And by the way we are no longer CORGI (except Ireland) but Gas Safe and if you need to call a registered engineer he/she will also need to have passed the LPG course and will be noted on the back of the Gas Safe registration card what they are qualified to work on.

I think these fittings are designed for fixing a pressure gauge to a pneumatic manifold. So he needs the one I've described as he will be fitting the cooker to a flexi pipe.",

You don't even need public liability insurance to be gas safe registered (i always thought in the old corgi days you needed it).\n<br> There are a lot of people employed in training centres and examining bodies. \n<br> I don't see anyone telling you to do your own gas work on this thread, I am certainly not advising you do your own work.
