Things seemed ok with that so my F-in-law then gave him a list of upgrading jobs and a wadge of cash to get it in perfect condition as he was working away and would come back for it. He then foolishly asked him to keep it in storage for some time. Every time he contacted Dave everything was fine, no problems, etc, etc! Things seem to go wrong a couple of years ago with a lot of vagueness and no contact was made about the sale!! Since we moved we've been trying to find out what happened!!! We managed to visit the garage several times and eventually found sites like this one as we didn't want to give up! At least we've finally found out now!!",
