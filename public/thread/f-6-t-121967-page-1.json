Backfire gone.\n<br> \n<br> Tickover has become a bit erratic when cold.\n<br> \n<br> Engine generally running lovely but it's this lack of power up a steep hill that's the problem.\n<br> \n<br> Engine temp is always 180/190.\n<br> \n<br> I've taken a jet out and I'm running 122\n<br> \n<br> Ideas chaps?\n<br> \n<br> Steve",

Engine starting to loosen up a bit I feel. \n<br> \n<br> I'd expect it to slow up the long French (or English) hills on the motorways.\n<br> \n<br> So the issue is......when I suddenly turn a corner on a small French road through a lovely vineyard area and am suddenly confronted with a bloody steep hill. Change down and floor it but the Jill's so steep the bus won't pull up it (No caravan) change down into first and the bus virtually comes to a standstill. After what seems an eternity struggling it gradually picks up and once going is away.\n<br> \n<br> I ordered 118 jets from Eurocarb (currently122) and have installed them thinking it may have too much fuel going in or too rich a mixture - remember it was backfiring a lot when I tried 98....no backfiring at all on 95.\n<br> \n<br> I need a carb specialist.. ...anyone \n<img alt=\"😁\" class=\"emoji smilies\" draggable=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/s9e/emoji-assets-twemoji@11.2/dist/svgz/1f601.svgz\">??",

If they were anywhere near correct I'd expect them to have 30mm vents going by the 122 mains. Are they 40's or 36's ?\n<br> If you've got 30mm vents the 118 mains is gonna be too small. It may seem to run ok but it will be lean and run hot...not good!",
