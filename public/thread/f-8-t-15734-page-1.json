Also fitted all new ignition switch, wiper switch and lights switch, just need to put the speedo in now.... \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.vwnetwork.net/images/shows/58panel/29012006076.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>Then I started to put on my new tyres and wheels but not sure about the fronts. Had a lot of advice about tyre sizes etc for lowered vans and the fact i have a 1300 IRS box running in a 1600 motor so opted for 185/65 Firestones for the back and 165/50 bridgestones for the front \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.vwnetwork.net/images/shows/58panel/29012006073.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.vwnetwork.net/images/shows/58panel/29012006074.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.vwnetwork.net/images/shows/58panel/29012006075.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>Havent wound down the front yet so it does look a little wierd I so hope it looks better once its down as I am a little nervous about my choice for the front.... \n<br> \n<br>We will see. I am sure it will be fine once its down and I have whizzed it up the road to settle it all as it has been sat like this for a while.....",
