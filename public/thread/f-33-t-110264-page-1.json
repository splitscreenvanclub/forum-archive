So we sit behind and wait, and wait and wait then wait some more........\n<br>\n<br>5 minutes later we are still sitting behind the van and there's no movement so I get out and have a look to see what's happening only to see the driver in the petrol station at the coffee machine, sat there drinking a coffee whilst leaving his van blocking the LPG pump.\n<br>\n<br>Eventually he sees me and realises someone else is waiting for the only LPG pump and sheepishly comes out and moves away.\n<br>\n<br>Rant over!\n<br>Thanks for listening \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>DD",
