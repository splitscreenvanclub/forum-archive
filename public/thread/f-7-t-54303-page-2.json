    "content" : "A little more info from Trafficmaster Site\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drivenincar.com/tracking.php\">http://www.drivenincar.com/tracking.php</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br> Trackstar TM100 Insurance Approved Tracking – installed Nationwide for £399.00 (incl. VAT) – Network Subscriptions apply. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br> \n<br>\n<br>About the System \n<br>Subscriptions \n<br>About Your Installation \n<br>FAQ's \n<br>\n<br>About the system\n<br>The Trackstar TM100 is a Thatcham Q Class Insurance Approved GPS Tracking System. It is monitored 24 hours a day and can be tracked to street level accuracy. \n<br>\n<br>It can be fitted to all modern 12 or 24 volt vehicles and can be removed and refitted to another vehicle if required. \n<br>\n<br>The system is monitored and designed by Trafficmaster PLC who are a Technology Company with a traffic sensor network providing traffic information throughout the UK . \n<br>\n<br>The Trackstar works along side the vehicle's existing immobiliser which should prevent theft through hot–wiring. Please call us if you do not have an immobiliser fitted as we can arrange to fit one for you whilst fitting your tracking system. It is important to remember that in the event of theft by hot–wiring the system would have no way of knowing that their was a theft in progress and would therefore not trigger. This does not mean that your vehicle could not be tracked but you would need to contact Trafficmaster to track the vehicle for you. \n<br>\n<br>Crime Statistics from 2005/2006 show that 5,556,513 vehicle and vehicle thefts were carried out in England and Wales which, whilst frightening, reflects a 1% drop over the previous year. This may well be related to the constant efforts by companies like Trafficmaster to provide a theft deterrent like the Trackstar TM100 which, with it's record of recovery on stolen vehicles, can only make it more difficult for theft to take place. \n<br>\n<br>Subscriptions\n<br>Subscriptions are paid directly to Trafficmaster after the installation has been carried out although your unit is ‘live' from the moment it is installed. In order to ensure that your system is tracking on installation, we will have completed as much of the subscription form for you as possible. Trafficmaster will, however, require further details for security and payment purposes and you will need to sign an original copy of the form which will be sent to you with your Trackstar TM100. \n<br>\n<br> \n<br>\n<br>Subscription Charges\n<br>\n<br>The subscription charge covers the monitoring of your tracking system and can be paid either annually by direct debit or as a one off payment referred to as Duration of ownership. The prices are listed below and include VAT. \n<br>\n<br>Annually by direct debit £132.00 \n<br>Duration of Ownership £445.00 payable by Credit or Debit Card. \n<br>(Please note that duration means duration of ownership and this subscription is not transferable from vehicle to vehicle or person to person.) \n<br>\n<br>Duration of ownership can only be paid as a one off fee by either debit or credit card.\n<br> \n<br>\n<br>About your Trackstar TM100 Installation \n<br>What happens when you book online with us? \n<br>Because TM100 is an Insurance Approved Thatcham TQA rated Stolen Vehicle Tracker, it must be fitted by an approved installer and is therefore not available as supply only. \n<br>\n<br>We will call you within 24 hours of receiving your order to book a time and date for your Trackstar TM100 installation at a location convenient to you. A confirmation letter will be sent to you once installation date has been confirmed. \n<br>\n<br>There will be a subscription form which you will need to complete relating to the network subscriptions. We will request some of the information required once your order has been confirmed and will use these details to ensure that the system is made live on installation. However, Trafficmaster will still need to receive further security information as well as the original form, signed by the vehicle owner, once the installation has been carried out. This form is usually brought along by the engineer at the time of installation or in some cases posted to an address convenient to you. \n<br>\n<br>The engineer will also bring the unit along with him on the day of installation. \n<br>\n<br>Arranging the installation \n<br>As we will arrange the installation for you at a location convenient to you, we would be grateful if you would bear in mind that as the installation will be carried out by a mobile engineer, he will be affected by bad weather conditions which can cause delays and for this reason, although we will let you know whether the installation will be carried out in the morning or afternoon, we cannot give exact installation times. \n<br>\n<br>Frequently asked Questions \n<br>Q. Is the Trackstar TM100 accepted by all insurers? \n<br>\n<br>A. We have not come across an insurer that does not accept the Trackstar TM100 however please feel free to call us if you would like to discuss your particular insurer with one of our team. \n<br>\n<br>Q. What vehicles can Trackstar TM100 be installed on? \n<br>\n<br>A. The Trackstar TM100 can be fitted to all modern 12 or 24v vehicles. The Trackstar is also suitable for some plant machinery and trailers but because the specifications vary so vastly we prefer to discuss individual requirements with you. \n<br>\n<br>Q. Can a TM100 be fitted to a motorbike? \n<br>\n<br>A. Unfortunately not, the Trackstar TM100 is not really suitable for motorbikes. \n<br>\n<br>Q. Does the installation price of the Trackstar TM100 vary from vehicle to vehicle? \n<br>\n<br>A. The price for installing the Trackstar TM100 is £399.00 including VAT however; you do need to pay a subscription (full details can be found on ‘subscription' page.) \n<br>\n<br>Q. Can the Trackstar TM100 still be tracked if the car is stolen with the keys? \n<br>\n<br>A. Most definitely. Because the system is a GPS vehicle tracker it can be tracked to Street level accuracy. The owner would, however need to contact the stolen vehicle helpline to alert them to the theft. \n<br>\n<br>Q. How long will it take from placing an order till an engineer comes out to me? \n<br>\n<br>A. This obviously varies from area to area but our usual booking time is 2 to 3 working days but it is always best to call us to confirm. \n<br>\n<br>Q. How long does the installation take? \n<br>\n<br>A. Again this may vary but we allow an hour and a half for each install.",
