Basically the idea is so we can loose the PITA twin jam nuts / locking tab washer system of holding your wheel drums in place / bearing adjustment correct.\n<br> \n<br> Similar to how late splits can upgrade from their twin jam nuts to bay window locking nuts, ie these:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.vwheritage.com/vw_act_shop.product_pID_25078454_crumbPageToLoad_2_lang_EN_country_GB.htm\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.vwheritage.com/vw_act_shop.p ... try_GB.htm</a>\n<br> \n<br> So I can gauge interest for potential batch numbers, and early bus owners let me know if its the sort of thing that might be of interest to them?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> NOW AVAILABLE here = \n<a href=\"http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/prod_2125428-Front-Hub-Lock-Nuts-T2-5563.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/prod_212 ... -5563.html</a>",
