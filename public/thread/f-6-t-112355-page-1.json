    "content" : "I'm in need of upgrading my 1300 SWA box for something with a more suitable cruising speed. Looking through JMR calculator a Freeway flyer 3.874 will give me cruising speed of 68mph compared to a pro street 4.125 at 59mph. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>I'm considering building a 2110 next year, but was advised the pro street would be better suited. I don't understand why if the freeway flyer has a better cruising speed. I was also told my current 1600 would struggle on hills with a 4.125, surely it will struggle more with a 3.874! or am I missing something?\n<br>\n<br>This is all hypercritical at the moment!",

Looking at JMR calculator the 4.125 will let me cruise at 60mph at 3000 RPM, which is better than my 1300 box as I need to be at 3500rpm for 60, which isn't great for motorway miles as it starts to get hot and the dells get thirsty, but its fine for most of Norfolk's daily roads speeds.\n<br>I was confused as they recommend the pro street for a 2110, Id have thought that would have been the other way round. As for the freeway flyer 3.875, 3000 RPM is 69MPH, fine for cruising but surely it will struggle on hills!",

This set up works great with my reduction boxes, 14\" 80 profile stock rims and tyres. It goes up 12% hills on the tour de Yorkshire route and cruises/at just over 60mph at 3000 rpm.\n<br>\n<br>Suits me..",
