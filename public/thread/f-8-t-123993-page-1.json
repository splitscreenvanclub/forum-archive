The originals were rotten around the lower hinge mount but were good above that. The door seal channel we bought wasnt the right shape so we put it in the stretcher:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993315.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993316.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then we were ready to repair the A post:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993317.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993319.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Same on other side:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993314.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The RHS B post inner was repaired:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993320.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993321.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993322.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The LHS B post inner didnt look too bad but was full of pin holes but a lot of the outer was good, so we kept as much of the outer as possible, and removed the full inner: \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993323.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993324.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The new panel has no mounts for the semaphores, so they were taken from the OG panel and fitted to the new panel:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993325.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993326.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993327.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Pinned in place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993329.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1993328.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Probably forgot loads, but thats about where we are up to at the moment \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

We have spent what seems like forever messing around with the silver weld through BBT / Taiwan panels. Not been impressed with any of them so far... Doubt Ill be using them again.\n<br> \n<br> The LHS B post bottom just ended at the sill, so I had to buy a lower KF repair piece and weld it on. Then we spent a bit more time lining the body up and pinning everything in place before we weld anything.

Wasnt impressed with this panel at all. Needed lots of work before we could fit it:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133047.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Painted all the inner framework body colour then welded the long side panel on:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133053.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133054.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133055.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133056.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Removed the engine lid hinge panel and mocked the rear corner up:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/2133050.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> We mocked the rear corners, hatch and engine lid up but got no pictures as it needs quite a bit of work to get the gaps nice. Thats the next thing to sort when we are back on it.",
