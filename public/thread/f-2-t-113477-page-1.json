    "content" : "I bought a 63 bug recently and its 80% OG paint. It has lovely thin paint patina to it where its been naturally sand blasted.\n<br> The wings have had a bit of poorly applied filler and wrong colour rattle can which I removed hoping to find OG paint underneath but the PO must have run a D/A over it before as only half of it was OG paint underneath. So I need a body shop to repair this. Ideally painting the areas in grey same as OG primer then pearl white and buffering the paint thin to match the body. Crazy thing is there was only the smallest of dings on the wing that they have tried to repair! \n<br> Anyone got any recommendations for someone to do this in the South East?",
