I didn't even notice on the inspection and remembered when I got home, so I text the guy but he says its not got one. I'm not sure if that a 'its missing' or 'no place in the dash for it' but I didn't notice a hole in the dash for one.\n<br>\n<br>Either way, still excited for the new bus \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
