I have seen blatant Chinese copy's of my company's weighers at exhibitions etc. Not a lot you can do as they're government aren't bothered about it at all. One of our customers bought one of these machines and it lasted 2 years before it was scrapped! (Our machines generally last 15-20 years before they're replaced) But it was that cheap that they weren't too bothered!\n<br>\n<br> The Chinese will control the world at some point. It's not if, it's when!\n<br>\n<br> Nick",
