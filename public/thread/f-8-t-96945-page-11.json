I had to re drill some of the holes where it bolts to the front bumper mounts and rear valence, but other than that, straightforward to mount onto the van.\n<br>\n<br>I then enlisted the help of my two plasterers and my brother in law to actually spin it.. Nervous does not describe how I felt at this stage, but he went over like a treat, even when at one stage, two of us were pushing against the other two so it felt like the bus was totally out of balence!\n<br>\n<br>So here he sits now,....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/9392dcd4c30c26b0d3a33c43bbe05f09.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/208b02712a06f0aa138a2cb0b2a7aecb.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/d189fbf5f6fbeb15817d3ace3e74353c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I can now complete the final bits of welding underneath including putting the jacking points on, the seam sealer and underseal, then brake lines and servo and then back on his feet with the suspension and drivetrain on so he can be moved in and out of the garage....none of which will involve me lying on my back!!\n<br>\n<br>Over and out!",

    "content" : "Well I've been hard at it this week seam sealing and as a result I took today off work asit was a warm day to lay on the underseal, which represents a huge milestone in my endeavours.\n<br>\n<br>I went for a product called 3m underseal which is supposed to be comparable to gravitex. It's sprayed via a \"Shultz\" gun which I borrowed from my dads neighbour.\n<br>\n<br>So after masking up all the wheel arch lips and a few other bits that I didn't want covered, got the mask out and....well ill let the pictures do the talking, takenk by my fiancé, who hastily moved her car out of overspray range...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/0239552c9b50d84283dc391825bc4df4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/62e3d69dc094c0e303ecdf9aec857f38.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/f3abfd6b7363b9ecad6ac67fe7f44002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/8c3291cad6d91dcd03b3741c90d15627.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>By the end I was covered and had the slightly unusual experience of having to wash my hair with thinners!\n<br>\n<br>Anyway I'm pleased with the end result,it gives a nice texture which covers weld marks and minor imperfections very well.....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/effa09b996bb43003e47d723a463cf89.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/b4e030ed67abd1285d301b15dbb7ee23.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I masked up the area where the beam mounts to as its quite a tight fit and the thickness of the stonechip might make fitting the beam a bit tight....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/4104d81b30bffd6922e337dce32fe0d1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/8f4f06936639a6b9c3d30b8c19bc1570.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/ed6c0f5737dc63bee98af94d5ead81e4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So I'm now at a stage where I can bolt a few shiny new bits on whist he's on his side. I'm sending the front beam to be blasted and in the mean time I'm going to start with the brakes......\n<br>\n<br>Jon",
