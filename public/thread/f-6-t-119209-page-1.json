    "content" : "I run stock wheels and have a straight axle conversion with spacers. Despite torquing them regularly it's impossible to get them really tight and they have a tendency to work themselves loose.\n<br> \n<br> This has meant one of the wheels especially has some lateral movement and has worn grooves in the wheel bolts. Anyone got any thoughts on what I can do to improve the situation. New bolts and new spacers aside? \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=21356&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=21356&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_3821.JPG\" title=\"IMG_3821.JPG (801.4 KiB) Viewed 2063 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> Cheers\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_3822.JPG\" title=\"IMG_3822.JPG (835.81 KiB) Viewed 2063 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_3822.JPG\" title=\"IMG_3822.JPG (835.81 KiB) Viewed 2063 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=21358&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=21358&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_3823.JPG\" title=\"IMG_3823.JPG (918.19 KiB) Viewed 2063 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=21357&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bec85afff225d9d7527249573951a03d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_3822.JPG\" title=\"IMG_3822.JPG (835.81 KiB) Viewed 2063 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",

You may find the wheels are beyond use if the surface profile has been worm. \n<br> \n<br> Those taper bolts have be around into the drum, damaging the initial part of the mount. Be very careful after you swap to new bolts that he problem doesn't continue. Oh, and definitely don't re-use those taper bolts with collars. Start with the correct bolts.",
