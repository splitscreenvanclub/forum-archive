I got all gears but they are not clean in selection.\n<br>\n<br>Is there a way of setting this up to gain a clean gear selection. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Richard.",

Before I adjusted the plate position I had all four gears in selection a little sticky in selection but there. Adjusted the plate tried the gears again and it's stuck in a position which I can't move. \n<br>\n<br>I hope it's nothing wrong in the transmission end Cap end and its just stuck. I can rotate the wheels by hand so I'm guessing it's not stuck in gear but just jammed.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone got any ideas,\n<br>Richard.",
