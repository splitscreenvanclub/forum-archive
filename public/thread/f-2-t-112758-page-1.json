    "content" : "Hello, I am asking a question that may have been posted several time before. I am looking to get information about acquiring a split screen van as a restoration project. I have no experience mechanically and no very little about bout the van except that I have liked them for a very long time.\n<br> There seems to be many sites selling restored projects ranging anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000. I was hoping to get a solid body and chassis and work from there. Can anyone recommend where I might get information about the best place to research the vans and source them? Any other information that you think would help would be most welcome. Many thanks",

    "content" : "Also, consider fully what your looking for in terms of result. Are you really up for a project or want a van to use soon as possible? Whats your goal timescale &amp; what's your budget, what can you do yourself, is this realistic? \n<br> \n<br> Body work is a money pit if getting it done &amp; a hard work, time eater if doing it yourself. I recommend you draw up a cost sheet before you buy. You can jot down all the costs for each element (bodywork, mechanical refit/mods, engine build level, interior etc) to refer to at a glance when assessing busses. \n<br> \n<br> I have a total project &amp; a running van (which is my daily driver). The running van I brought earlier this year as a part finished project &amp; having been looking for about a year (its easy to go &amp; buy a crap shed of a van!) for something to use while I restore the other (started looking for an early bay then was pricing into just about running splits) I found part done projects could be really good value for cost &amp; time to completion so worth looking at those.\n<br> \n<br> Good luck",
