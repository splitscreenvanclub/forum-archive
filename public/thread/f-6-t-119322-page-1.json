I've just noticed the Kilometers noted for the MOT last year is the same as what it reads now (I haven't done loads of kilometers this year, possibly 200KMs)... The MOT is due in June... would this be an MOT failure?\n<br> \n<br> Would anyone know what the problem could possibly be and is it easy to fix?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Chris",

Check the dust cap on one front wheel (cannot remember which) it'll have a square hole in it which should have a speedo cable poking through held in place by a circlip of split pin. If there is nothing holding it in poke it back through and secure it. If it is still there it could be a nomen cable. Good luck. Dave\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
