    "content" : "1966 21 window Devon samba\n<br>\n<br>Original uk Ramsgate delivered bus,really nice and mostly original Devon interior,red top tables,square ended sink unit with whale pump.has sliding cupboards in rear. Also have cooker that fits on door it's not a Dudley though,still has cooling rack and screws for legs. Cargo door units are repo units also overhead locker/table storage.duracor cushions have seen better days. I also have two easicool units one correct flat back and a slanted back,was going to make one good one out the two.\n<br>\n<br>Bus is running 1600 twin port on a straight axel box,also torsion arms turned,it's as low as it can go without serous modification to rear wheel arches. The shock mounts have also been moved to the rear of the axel tube,old mounts are all still there so nothing that can't go back stock if that's your deal.front end is running dropped spindles,raised steering box and wheel arches have been rubbed. Koni adjustable shocks all round.\n<br>\n<br>Bus is rock solid underneath all seam sealed treated and painted body colour minimal amounts of filla used for panel work,you have to use something! When I got the bus in 2010 it received rear corners,battery trays,inner and outer sills,cargo door bottoms,inner front valence and a couple of outriggers. I was running it ratty for a while then decBided to blend fresh metal back in.....ended up painting whole bottom half!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> the only areas that still need attention are some of the skylights which are not that bad at all. Also inside the bus above side windows,again nothing major,this is why I never put a headliner in her,was next on the list.\n<br>\n<br>£36,500",

Sink unit is 64 or earlier cant remember,also no hole in bulkhead for water tank,these are all things that threw me. The rest of the interior Is correct....I think,and I'm pretty sure it was always a Devon,all the gas pipework was all there,badge on the cargo door, the holes are ther for the Devon light above table,just loads of things that point out its a devon.
