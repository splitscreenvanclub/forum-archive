I missed out on a whole set of interior panels earlier int he year - I hadn't appreciated how much I wanted them back then!! I know they are hard to find but someone must have some, even if it is just so I can get some colour matching done... I do like original panels if I can, even one panel at a time...\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Dave",
