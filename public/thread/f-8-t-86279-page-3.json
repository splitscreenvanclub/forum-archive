Sounds confusing but kinda opposite of my build.\n  <br>\n  <br>Are you going to run the torque tube in a hump in the floor or keep it below stock bus centerline?\n  <br>\n  <br>My build has alot of the same design problems but different solutions.\n  <br>\n  <br>Would love to see you start a thread at Pelican Parts in the vw/porsche conversion forum, as you are going to spend a bunch of time there!

It does mean that it will never be slammed but why would you build an AWD and then slam it???? Flat, smooth tarmac aint that slippy!\n<br>\n<br>Thread now up and running over at Pelican in the VW/porsche forum.",

I have 17s (reps) for mine as the 18s I have in the garage were too big (unless you buy 2 pairs of 7.5J fronts). That is based on the torsion tube / arms etc. from an '86 911. 17s also meant I got a bit more rubber and less wheel which is not a bad thing on a camper.",
