I have the big table with the double leg behind it, so making it free standing.\n<br>\n<br>I have to get a leg made and source the hinge. I have a few photos to go by, but would anybody be able to supply me with some measurements? Also would anyone have any ideas on getting as close as posbbile to an OG hinge? \n<br>\n<br>I'd like to get this as close to original as I possibly can, as the rest of the interior is so nice. I'd be very grateful and promise a pint or two at a show!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks,\n<br>\n<br>Mark",

The hinge will be the easy part as they are nothing special, what will stump you is the sprung clip bit that keeps the leg locked down as I've never seen anything even remotely like it for sale ever anywhere not never ever \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>There's a pretty bad picture of it on this thread on volksmoan\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.volkszone.com/VZi/showthread.php?t=560454\">http://www.volkszone.com/VZi/showthread.php?t=560454</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, I will sort pics tomorrow. Are you going to be at peppercorn/sweetcorn and you can have a proper look? If not, I'm hoping to be at action depending on how little Empi is doing. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
