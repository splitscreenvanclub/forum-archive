All of this is to get ready for what will soon be fitted up onto our newly Velvet Green and Pearl White bus.\n<br> \n<br> And I am going to say something I've never really dwelt on before. That is a new and huge respect to those of us that that rebuild and restore these old classics. I have never before understood the care, dedication, heartache occasionally, time and energy it takes. \n<br> \n<br> I dont think I'll ever again be able to walk past a newly restored bus or bug etc and not stop to dwell on this. It's been a monster part of my last year, since Busfest 2015 really and I think I've survived it and even enjoyed it most of the time. We are not done yet but these are big days.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8010_zpszzjkc5qp.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/cc2519f767839f9fef9e210a39cad084\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/Drums_zpsxdlu24et.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/7cadc9df2dd24abfa1f6cd557b45fabe\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8014_zpskuyqqzfu.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/eba1a8d5750da4fc21442c4676e4fbc4\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8009_zpsadrh0d0k.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/fea226e849be3b0e269eff760978418d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8012_zpspfc8owa0.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/2bd22b4e250deabef8358a07292751d5\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8015_zpsxj9khwi9.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/19e65a8f073cd94777734ddcba23ccdd\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8016_zpszbjt2nej.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/2fad98f914f4212903969fec893a1924\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8017_zpsnrmk8ln1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/f93bb1011c7e319615eec959b8bcdefb\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> And my wiper motor was assembled and wraped, ready to go on\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8008_zps6dduq0yy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/d9180f72bccf909d1f05adecf979c9ec\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

I wish I had taken a before and after as this doesn't look much now!\n<br> \n<br> We have already purchased the Link pin set for both sides with the seals, caps and needle bearings and I think I am really quite pleased with the result. \n<br> \n<br> The king pin seals will need popping out and new ones warming and easing over and in. But the king pins don’t seem to have a great deal of tightness, play or wear. Paul Wisc only fitted them 3-4 years ago (when we replaced the front beam) so it feels like these might be alright to go again and just keep an eye on.\n<br> \n<br> One king pin was free and easy. The other was a bit gummed up but once we cleaned round the bottom of the pin, degreased and freed it, the movement was much better. I hope that once they are painted up in chassis black by hand tonight, fitted on, new nipples tightened up and greased, they will be just fine for a while and hopefully just one to watch.\n<br> \n<br> Hopefully I / we have called this one right but if you read this and have thoughts / suggestions do please comment?\n<br> \n<br> And I have just one more thing to buy – the bottom front axle king pin bottom plug. I wonder if Nigel has SSVC stock, as C&amp;C has run out and Schofield’s don’t seme to have it? Has anyone else bought them recently?\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8029_zpsffrywfcs.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/bcc05dc40f65c23238f87c07dffea9e2\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8030_zps0jrt3l9b.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/5f928218cff2d0a24a0f5108361b7d78\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Mark then moved on to pressing the inner and outer bearings and seals into the rear IRS hubs, again getting them ready to fit.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8031_zpsxx4mxmqa.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/bba47a907e0b17c3d7e2995339b8f9fa\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8032_zpsoagl2fod.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/f5095947bd654f58a2e38d01cd9f02db\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8033_zpsr6gcgfut.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/0455cdcd018ea3edb02979a7118fb400\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8034_zpsxqpjkczr.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/32d0dfe4c5301eb15cbab21c35bb6db0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8035_zpshbuea7sl.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/f6ede73d8a7380b2a60e3233af35dd0b\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> After a bit of research into EP and EP2 grease this became the grease tube of choice for me – for the beam, king pins and bearings\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s286.photobucket.com/user/wheatywheels/media/Veronica%20resto%202016-17/DSC_8036_zpsmpupf9nn.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/images/ext/81a10e9ed58f512417b125131c3e0cc2\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> How can it be that so much work looks so little on the floor!

This was a big day as it was the first time I had seen my two colours together, and after a light colour sanding and polish. I was not disappointed!\n<br> \n<br> I wasn’t there to see Veronica leave Andover but I finished work to see her arrive and just dodge the drizzle.
