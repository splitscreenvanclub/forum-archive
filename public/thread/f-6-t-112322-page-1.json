However, withithe fuse blown the headlights still work, but other things stop working, like the interior light. Not being great with electrics, I'm completely baffled.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone with any ideas?",

It's been fitted with a 25 amp, but no idea if this is correct.\n<br>\n<br>It's a new loom. I'll try the disconnect method and see how that goes!",

    "content" : "Wow..\n<br>That is a big fuse to blow!\n<br>I reckon you may find the installation was with a bigger fuse to get round a problem\n<br>I would have expected a 6 fuse box as well...So maybe the board has been upgraded...\n<br>I would map first of all and try to find out how it is laid out.\n<br>\n<br>I would find out what wires are going to that fuse on each side of the fuse and where they go to..\n<br>\n<br>Did you fit the loom or do you know what year it was made for?\n<br>On my 65 Fire truck. I took off the kick board and wrote labels and attached them to each wire I identified as I went along. Then I worked out which side of the fuse board the wires went to snd which fuse and compared with the hand and year layout...\n<br>Then I moved wires back to where they should have been on the board\n<br> One by one with the battery off!\n<br>It worked fine then..\n<br>Someone had played about and some circuits did not work.\n<br>I still need to work on how the siren circuits are supposed to work. .",
