    "content" : "Hope this is of some use, last year my bus had a large leak ( the oil cooler seals had been siliconed !! ) Garage replaced and all ok for a week then it started again, took it back and turns out my cooler and engine block are different , one early the other later so needed the stepped ones. The difference is small and was overlooked the first time round, all ok now.",
