In my humble opinion for that money I would like to have proper seats instead of t-shirts.. \n  <br>\n  <br>Don't get me wrong, I hope you can sell it.. it's definitely a cool bus\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>IMO it's priced right for the current value of a German 15 window tbh. I'm fully aware of how much £35k, that's the reason I'm selling. I have other things in my life that need money spending on them and they're all more important than owning this particular bus. I love it to pieces but sometimes you just have to go with your head instead of your heart.\n<br>\n<br>As for the seat covers, a pair of TMI ones is about £350. I'll happily knock that off the price.
