It needs nearly everything that you can do to it - doing to it, same as the 52 but worse in some places better in others. I will have to build the chassis and pop the body on i think. The thin body has faired better suprisingly, but it does need a bit of straightening in the back and side. Made gotenberg in sweden tonight, more travelling tomorrow and hands on it monday. Going to be an interesting trip back,hope it doesnt fall apart on the trailer.\n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\"> cheers mark",

I know they will read this and the other pair who were on a mission of a simular kind. \n<br>My new 51 is just a monster(well may be just in my eyes \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> ), im over the moon with it. \n<br> \n<br>Ok here are some more pics of the van as found....and a bit of its recovery a month or two back for the people who like pics... \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/100_1305Small.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>This is the hacked in back window and the mud coming through, the glass had broken under the pressure.

The roof basically for the most part just popped out \n<br>Cab X parts are very good and also almost unbelievably the front panel and A posts are perfect, and even the bottom of the original A post are there which is almost miracle stuff and alot of the inner and outer valance although it will have to be changed. Front doors are very good considering, and the sides are not too terrible. \n<br>The Centre front chassis is Bad but not as bad as the 52 and looks to be fixable which is nice as its the very early style as does the beam, all the centre of the chassis is toast under the cargo floor, not one part usable. The rear torsion tube looks ok over the double section but the rear part of the chassis rails look not so good and very bad by the battery trays. \n<br>The back floor panel to engine bay is not good and also the rear wheel tubs are bad espesially on the pass side but on the plus side the back corners and engine lid do look like they will straighten ok - hopefully. \n<br> \n<br>The guys abroad put in a frame under the van to stop it from collapsing to get me home which held just fine. \n<br> \n<br>The Plan now is to make a huge jig using the 52 chassis then remove all the 51 chassis shot blast it all repair the front and rear sections, slot them in the jig and then put the rest of the frame together. Repair the body and pop them together. All that driving gives you alot of time to think... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>Will probably start it next year.. \n<br>Cheers \n<br> \n<br>Mark",
