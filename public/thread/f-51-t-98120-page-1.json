    "content" : "I could get some more tomorrow if you like on the areas you have specifically requested to see..I have her in dry storage at the moment..she is very solid and that's the good thing about her as you can see all this and what you are getting. There are no hidden nasty surprises with her as I have had most of the welding done already and she is a blank canvas almost to put back together. I know the safaris need some attention but hey! she has safaris and they are pretty cool. Plus she is a walk-through so you won't get wet making a cup of tea or have to climb over the bulk which is a nice touch. She is only going because I have another project. She is a very well known bus as she used to belong to Ade (most people know him) so you can ask about and see she is genuine. I will see what pics I have and get some more. Thanks.
