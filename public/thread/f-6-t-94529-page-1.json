I topped it up with .20ltrs\n<br> \n<br> Is it normal for the gearbox oil to filter down into the reduction box ?\n<br> \n<br> over the winter I've had leaks from what looks like the gearbox and box reduction boxes, have managed to get a mate to sort a ramp for tomorrow, hence filling it today, just wondering if I should be worried about what I've perceived as gearbox oil filtering down ...\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Nik",
