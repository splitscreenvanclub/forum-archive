    "content" : "Evening all, I have an issue with a standard spilt box which whines / rumbles quite bad in 4th and also slightly in 3rd. I have just swapped for another box and it's exactly the same ! Surely it can't be the same fault on both ? I have disconnected the gear selector when it's in 4th and then moved the stick back and it goes a good few MM. Indicating that the gear stick / mech has plenty of room to pull it back further so I believe the issue isn't there. The only thing I have kept is the hockey stick / nose cone, could it be this ?? The first box kept jumping out of fourth also, I haven't tried this one on the road yet, just on axle stands . Anyone please offer any advice ?? \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
