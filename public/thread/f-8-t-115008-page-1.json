    "content" : "Hello everyone!\n<br>\n<br>I'm new to this forum but have just purchased this bus with a view to carrying out a full custom resto! It's been a life long dream and I can't wait to get started!\n<br>\n<br>I bought the bus from Paul Irving of IRV'S VW Restorations. It was his personal bus which he was going to restore but with new business growth in mind he's kindly sold this beauty to me. Together we'll be building one of the coolest buses out there (I hope!). Please enjoy the \"before\" pics before strip down, dipping and any replacement panels are put in place. No cutting corners here, this will be a top end build and built to the highest of standards.\n<br>\n<br>I've battles with the \"keep original\" vs \"not\" and I want the bus I want... Not a trailer queen in standard form. When built it will be enjoyed for sure. SO I'm going old vs new custom... It will look largely original on the outside (apart from stance and wheels) but underneath it will have a modern engine (probably Subaru WRX turbo!) and gearbox as well as power steering, breaks, air ride etc etc... Full spec will evolve but this will be a serious bus once done! \n<br>\n<br>I hope we don't offend anyone not going the original route but I hope it will still be enjoyed the way she will turn out...\n<br>\n<br>Any feedback along the way great fully received!!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Nick\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/8ae70aa116f5fdb1d37a5ee161527663.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/53b9716ea8096b5f61c2ff86fdee841b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/8f31d5b12777d4e58cf9de9f62b1966f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/56423170c3106ef81acb0eb092b5b0e5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/d4b509e81bfc5f78b1430c61bfd36b3d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/c110674e31ba94ca10184baabc048340.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/9e3fa040211d0a878abd11bb0f5b9c64.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160312/575a4bfb961398a4f048ad51c2733e7d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
