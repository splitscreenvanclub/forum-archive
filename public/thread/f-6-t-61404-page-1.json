    "content" : "If you have the ones that meet on the roof bows and span the whole width of the van then you might need a second pair of hands to help you position them. When you have the panel in roughly the correct place with one side into the trough behind the rail that runs around the bottom of the roof then you need to bend the other side upwards to get it onto the rail then push the bend you have created upwards until the panel snaps into place. It can be awkward and the panel may need trimming a few times to get it right but if it is fitted well it should almost support itself like an arch.\n<br> \n<br> Once you have them fitting correctly take them back out and varnish or paint them before putting them back in for a final fit\n<br> \n<br> I made my own panels using 1.5mm birch ply that is very easy to bend and cut using a strong pair of scissors. Instead of drilling into the roof bows to screw the panels on I used some \"no more nails\" tape from B&amp;Q to stick the panels to the roof bows. This has been very effective and doesn't damage the vehicle. \n<br> \n<br> To cover the joints where the panels meet I got some 1 inch aluminium strips cut at my local metal supermarket (look in yellow pages) and cut them so they were slightly longer than the length of the roof arch. When put in place over the joints and carefully bent into shape they completely conceal the joint and look neat. Because they are slightly long they also support the roof panels.\n<br> \n<br> I think wooden roof panels look great and can easily be removed if ever you want to change them, re-finish them or whatever. Hope this helps. Good luck.",

I also made a strenghtener/extra roof bow but used some really thick ply cut and shaped to roof then liquid nailed on to roof, was never that happy with this though and worried that the ply may warp and pull roof out of shape with it. Lasted two years with out causing any problems mind. So thinking of using this method again\n<br> \n<br> When you say you \".....put them in one strip at a time glueing them together as I went\" did you build this up using the 1.5mm ply or something thicker? Also was the first layer glued to roof? Only curious as this seems a better, easier an neater way of doing it than I had done, wish I'd thought of doing it this way first time round.",
