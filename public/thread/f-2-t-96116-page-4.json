    "content" : "Machine7 have definitely done their homework on this one. I fitted some to my bus not long ago; the 3 metres was a good length, I was surprised it used so much to be honest! \n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #000080\">\"This is a modern high specification fuel hose, which is an ideal upgrade / replacement hose for all Air-Cooled vehicles, including Beetle, Ghia, Type-3 &amp; Buses.<br> <br>The specification is referred to as SAE J30 R9, and is used on modern fuel injection vehicles, it is designed to withstand modern unleaded fuels.<br>Over recent years, fuel at the pump has been replaced with a grade referred to as E5. It contains a 5% mix of Ethanol. The Ethanol mix is better for the environment, but unfortunately degrades rubber fuel hoses. There are current government proposals to change unleaded fuels to E10, with 10% Ethanol. SAE J30 R9 fuel hose is designed to withstand the level of Ethanol in E5 and E10 fuels.<br> <br>Please note, we no longer stock original style cloth braided fuel hose, as the SAE J30 R9 is much safer. Fuel hoses should be checked every few months, and replaced, if there are any signs of degradation. We believe that anybody using the old style cloth (or stainless) braided should now upgrade to the more modern higher specification. It is far better to be safe.<br> <br>The hose has a 5.6mm internal bore, which is ideal for all standard installations as well as most twin carburettor set-ups.<br>The external diameter is 12.6mm, which is larger than the original cloth braid hose, so you will to use larger clips. We keep suitable clips in stock, Item code 054.690.50.<br> <br>This hose is black, and is printed with W = SAE J30 R9 FUEL INJECTION 5.6MM.<br>Designed to be used on monder Fuel Injected vehicles, but is obviously compatable with Carburettor Fuel Systems, as found on Air-Cooled vehicles.<br> <br>The Bundle contains 3 metres of hose, which should be sufficient to replace all of the flexible hose normally founds on all Air-Cooled models, plus a replacement fuel filter, and a set of 10 stainless hose clips of the correct size for this hose.\"</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.machine7.com/shopimages/products/normal/250-dscf9427.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xProd=13193\">http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xProd=13193</a>\n<!-- m -->",

    "content" : "VW Aircooled Works - E100 biofuel line\n<br>\n<br>Just picked up on this thread and see that other businesses with interest have commented so feel fair to add my comment.\n<br>\n<br>We were actually the \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">first</span> to offer only ethanol resistant fuel line and have never offered the braided product due to testing we carried out at our workshop. We offer R9 fuel line and also E100 biofuel line. \n<br>\n<br>It is correct to say that R9 fuel line will give increased level of safety over braided line with no specification. However, care should still be taken when fitting this. Basically this fuel line is rubber based so will be prone over time to attack from ethanol. Lifetime of this product in a modern car is 5 years when the car is used daily. However, as are vans tend to stand over winter this can be reduced as the ethanol vaporizes through the wall of the line taking with it the natural oils so making it harden.\n<br>\n<br>We have launched on our website and at VW shows this season a non-rubber based fuel line that is resistant to 100% ethanol as well as being re-enforced and heat resistant. This fuel line is basically FIT AND FORGET. Check out our article Worst Nightmare in ISSUE 7 HAYBURNER. \n<br>\n<br>Biofuel kits for single carb, twin carb running on both std 6mm tails and aftermarket 8mm tails are available and we can make up any kits to order. Do not assume that suppliers will give you the correct fuel line for your engine, internal diameter of fuel hose is critical the fuel clips are not what should hold the hose it should have grip force.\n<br>\n<br>Important thing to remember is that the fuel being used today is modern mixture not what VW designed their engines around and as such we bring modern safety products to the VW classic scene. Our Fuel cut off solenoids with E100 biofuel hose are the ultimate safety feature for fuel delivery.\n<br>\n<br>Please check out our for sale thread offering discount on webshop prices.
