Trust me I do have some method in my madness! \n<br>\n<br>OK so buy some later spindles and then run 944 discs and calipers.... thought this would be the case. My early spindles are recon ones too so should sell reasonable well.\n<br>\n<br>I am having a new factory built.... it will have rather alot of 'spare' space so the plan is to get the bus in for some mods \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v101/David72/Picture038-3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
