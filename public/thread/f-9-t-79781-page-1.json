I have been advised a campsite will be wise to spend the nights partly for the electric hook up, and partly for the showers. \n<br>\n<br>does anybody have any recommendation of sites in or around the Lake district that are open all year round, we have it for 7 days so a bit of distance between them would be good. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers \n<br>Doofus. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
