We when agreed a completion date. Only for it to pass and then tell me to stop bugging him. So onto next painter. Some progress being made. A few repairs to be made. 914 engine currently being rebuilt. Red9 front and rear to go in. So need gearbox. And a trimmers in glasgow for the seats.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
