As type21f says, there is actually data to back up the higher numbers of buses in later years. \n<br>\n<br>There is also commonality of layout across 64-67 and convergence of consistent parts from 60-67 so the sheer number of years contributing to the same parts to a 65-67 bus stacks up as well as there being more buses made and surviving from those years. For example a 60-67 bulkhead seat is the same all the way through, a 64-67 rear seat, 62-67 wardrobe, etc.\n<br>\n<br>The 64 is the only 'one year only'* layout with the corner-cut cooker unit and the rear cargo door washtand cupboard, so maybe this is rarer than the 60-61 or 62-63 variations? But then how many more buses were made, and how many earlier sinks didn't get broken along the way and how many people didn't lose the door cooker cupboard at some point. And also the '64 is mostly a 65-67 but with tweaks to a couple of parts, rather than a fundamentally different layout as previoius years were, so...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>*I don't think anyone's clear on the exact cut-offs so maybe more than one year for producing this style but it seems to centre around 64?",
