C&amp;C have a full door but only up to 1960 and it looks like Classic Fab did a lower frame repair but it is now no longer available for drop ship whatever that means. Any help much appreciated.",

I can build an order list on the Classicfab US website but they will only give the option to deliver to the US or Mexico and that seems like a great road trip but not cost effective. The same parts are not showing on C&amp;C who are meant to be their European distributor. :bounce",

    "content" : "I had similar issues buying KF parts many years ago.\n<br> I paid for the parts and then the shipping on the US site. They took the order and the money. Then they tried to cancel. They thought they were to be shipped to British Virgin Islands? I worked in procurement and I hit heavy with them. Willing buyer willing seller I had a contract with them to supply!\n<br> \n<br> I did manage to have a really good slanging match with the principal Gerson by email. Had fun arguing with him. In the end told him how useless C&amp; C were. C&amp;C had little or no idea of what they had in stock, had on order or when it would arrive. In the end he directed me to a Columbian distributor and through them I bought two complete A posts shipped by air mail direct into UK. 5 days from new order to receipt. \n<br> C&amp;C made great play on holding more KF stock. KF were still criticised for poor supply.\n<br> \n<br> Klassicfab last year set up their own distribution network in Spain. They have withdrawn from European Agents. You can find on line but are they operating?\n<br>",
