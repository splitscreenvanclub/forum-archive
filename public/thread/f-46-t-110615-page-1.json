It has three screw holes on the flap which screws to the frame and two on the flap to the door.\n<br>I cleaned both of mine and noted that the upper one had lots of play, on examination it has been smashed and the frame is broken at the back. \n<br>Does anyone have a source of exact replacement or an OG one I can buy?\n<br>Please..\n<br>\n<br>Mine works fine but I am sure my Grandsons will test it within an inch of it's life and it will stress the screw holes and expire.\n<br>I have fed the screw holes with plastic wood to give added life already...\n<br>Anyone?\n<br>OG with patina would be nice?\n<br>Interior collectors?\n<br>\n<br>Clymoj?\n<br>BJ1?\n<br>Maddison?\n<br>Boyden?",

The old hinges are good though, and aren't too shiny. However I'm still living out of a Premier Inn at the moment, hence why you haven't received your other bits yet, apologies. But persevere and keep that hinge alive as long as you can, there's a backup here for you.",
