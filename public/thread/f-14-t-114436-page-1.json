Just wondered if anyone knew anything about airstream caravans???\n<br>\n<br>Can I tow one behind a car / bus and if so what is the max length and weight?\n<br>\n<br>Looking to perhaps get one to use whilst the bus is off the road being welded. But wanted to make sure I can tow it behind my car and perhaps the bus when it is finished being welded.\n<br>\n<br>Regards\n<br>\n<br>Flip \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">",

Original interiors are very heavy. Retro fitted interiors would decrease the axle weight.",

    "content" : "Airstreams have a very high hitch weight, particularly the vintage models - look how far back the wheels are set on the vintage models. They are properly built from decent materials so they are VERY heavy, a 24' 1961 Airstream weighs over 3000lbs with a hitch weight of 340lbs - (link: \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.airstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Trailer-Motorhome-Weights.pdf\">https://www.airstream.com/wp-content/up ... eights.pdf</a>\n<!-- m -->).\n<br>\n<br>You can counter the hitch weight by storing stuff at the rear of the Airstream and if you buy one with a rear water tank then filling that up before travelling helps. You need to seriously watch stability if you make it tail-heavy though - it's a balancing act/compromise.\n<br>\n<br>Maybe you'd get away with a small one like a Bambi with a Golf. The axle upgrade is a bit of a grey area if you are not buying from a dealer, I believe dealers selling them as 'ready for the road' have to make the running gear compliant. The US spec calls for a 2\" towball but they are readily available. If running the original electrically operated drum brakes you would need a brake controller, Tekonsha make them. I run one with electric brakes (and a Tekonsha controller) and they work really well so don't let that put you off.\n<br>\n<br>Good places to fire off questions are \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ukairstreamers.org\">www.ukairstreamers.org</a>\n<!-- w --> and the UK Airstreamers facebook page.",

It's not too hard to work things out.\n<br>Basic rule of thumb is don't tow anything more than 80% of your cars curb weight and keep your nose weight below 80kg (depending on the vehicle). These rules can be stretched for an experienced caravanner.",
