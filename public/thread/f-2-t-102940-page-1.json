    "content" : "I've got RED9 kits front and rear.\n<br> The rear was not a straight bolt on job! Due to the position of the thick welding on the red9 kit meant the chassis legs that come from the torsion bar tube did not sit into the seat for them on the red9 kit, why red9 don’t just weld them on the outside is beyond me! So out came the grinder and ground the edge off the legs, after that it fitted pretty well. I told the guys at Red9 so hopefully the fault has been fixed.\n<br> \n<br> @SCUK\n<br> I have the Subaru Turbo engine and box!\n<br> \n<br> I asked Red9 guys if the Subaru box would fit with their kit and they said yes!\n<br> Fitting the Subaru gear box, to get the drive shafts to be aligned with the hubs means the gearbox sits further forward so the mounts on the red9 kit where useless and served no purpose, so out came the cutter and grinder again. Then I made up some new brackets to mount the box. Also the rear bar of the red9 kit fouls the box so had to cut a section out of the box section to allow the box to fit.\n<br> Although I could of got around it the torsion tube made the fitting of the box very tight and difficult and as it was not doing much now as it has the wishbone suspension I decided to cut the central section out to make it an easier fit, also for the same reason I realised the chassis legs where not really necessary so after the earlier effort of making them fit I decided to remove them and brace up the red9 kit and torsion tube for strength.\n<br> Again I spoke to Red9 guys at Stoner show afterwards, and then they told me “Oh yes we had to cut the rear bar to get another Subaru box to fit”!\n<br> \n<br> But it all fits and works now…",
