Wondered if it was something the mag could help with?\n<br>\n<br>Well I think it's an interesting idea, just not sure of the best way to deal with it... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> Something like a \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">Would Like To Meet</span> page? Or a list of local VW clubs? With info like how often you meet up, contact details, informal/irregular get togethers, or routine 2nd Wed of every month at the Red Lion sort of thing. The forum sounds like the best place to have a list, but then not all SSVC members go on the forum... \n<br>\n<br>Appreciate other ideas on this as I'm just tapping out loud here \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
