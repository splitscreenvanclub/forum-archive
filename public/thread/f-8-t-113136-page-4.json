It's bust a hole one of the pistons but the case looks ok so looking at a reasonable rebuild with new barrels and pristons etc. One head cracked so looking to replace these as well. It's SP 1500 (1966) so a any thoughts please, upgrade to 1641 from VW heritage etc, and stick on TP heads which I have the opportunity to get. Also looking to get an OG refurbed carb from someone like riverhaus .
