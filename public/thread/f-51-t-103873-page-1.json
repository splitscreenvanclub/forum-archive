    "content" : "i purchased the Bus back in Dec 2009 after it restoration was completed and have enjoyed it very much, but now it's time for a change.\n<br>\n<br>I have many invoices of work carried out, you can see from the last pictures there is quite a lot of information, mostly receipts and invoices of work carried out either by the previous owner or myself.\n<br>\n<br>The bus has had many changes over my owner ship as you'll see from the pictures but the Buses Current Setup is as follows;\n<br>\n<br>Engine is a rebuilt Approx 5000 miles ago, 1600 twin port with twin 34 Webber Carbs, deleted Heater Pipes and a stock exhaust. Original single carb setup included in the sale also comes with Original air box as well.\n<br>\n<br>Front; \"transporterHaus\" 3.5 inch drop spindles, with a Creative Engineering Weed-eater 2 Narrowed and adjustable beam with Gaz shocks. \n<br>\n<br>Rear; 1968 Beetle 1300 gearbox with straight axles, Upgraded Gaz Shocks and 10mm wheel spacers.\n<br>\n<br>Wheels; 14 inch Steel Wheel in red with 165/55/14 tyres front an rears, with White wall inserts. and OG Hubcaps (German Chrome)\n<br>\n<br>OG Hub brakes all round\n<br>\n<br>Inside the Bus has all OG parts including a rare Samba Clock and Deluxe Chrome Speedo Surround including a very nice OG Fuel Gauge with matching Chrome, as well as a period Motorola Radio currently not wired in to speakers, An additional Rev counter mounted in the Chrome ash tray completes the dash. \n<br>\n<br>Walk through seats and Camping interior, in the rear good original condition and re upholstered door cards in Cream Vinyl and brown tartan.\n<br>\n<br>The Bus is currently dry stored in a garage at work located in Folkestone close to the Channel Tunnel, but can be seen at my home in Hastings. \n<br>\n<br>Overall condition of the bus is very good but is in need of a little TLC in certain places, Ive had a quote to do this work and it is £500, although I wanted to sell the bus as honestly as I could so the new owner can see how original it is.\n<br>\n<br>I'm on the look out for something a little different but cheaper so a Part ex is possible, but would require a injection of Cash.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">£15500<br></span>\n<br>The sale also includes 2 roof racks one 3 bow and one unknown model but large which can be seen in the pictures as well as some vintage suitcases......\n<br>\n<br>Regards \n<br>Nathan \n<br>07894947930 or \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:eddielittle@hotmail.co.uk\">eddielittle@hotmail.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e -->",
