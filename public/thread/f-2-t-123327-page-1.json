    "content" : "Hey, shipped many buses,bugs and Type3’s but always dealt with individual sellers. Never had a problem...have always sourced through theSamba. Paid by bank transfer. Ask all the right question and ask for plenty of pics. Personally I’ve always found the VW community in the States to be honest. Down side at the mo is the exchange rate. IMHO it’s a buyers market at the moment so maybe see what’s around that’s already in the UK. I’ve just bought a bug in the UK for the first time in 15yrs as (it came from Cali originally) cos rates+shipping cost is making it less viable to ship. Now the bit that will p!ss a few people off but I wouldn’t touch a Brazilian split at any price!!!",
