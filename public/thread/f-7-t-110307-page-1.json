    "content" : "Thank you Shelltoes!\n<br>\n<br>So, as most people know a traditional tracker is hidden in your vehicle and at some point will gain its power supply from your vehicle itself, normally located under the dashboard (wired). The modern day thief operates like this:\n<br>\n<br>Steals vehicle\n<br>puts a jammer in cigarette lighter straight away, this the jams the signal of the installed tracker\n<br>drives vehicle to a safe house/safe location\n<br>disables the battery\n<br>scans/searches the vehicle for fitted tracker \n<br>finds tracker - rips it out and throws it in water or simply destroys it. \n<br>Tracker no longer works\n<br>takes your vehicle to a rest location, normally leaves in a warehouse/shed or even train station car parks/airport car parks for a period of around 24/36hrs\n<br>After this soak period they thief assumes the vehicle is now 'clean' and starts the journey to the end user/destination. \n<br>\n<br>This is a very basic description of what the thief does and the knowledge is built up from the 9 ex police officers we have now working for us at APU Ltd.\n<br>\n<br>Our device which we do not call a tracker but an ARU works differently and has a few more features than the traditional tracker.\n<br>\n<br>The ARU has:\n<br>Its own in built power source that last for 3-5 years dependent on reporting rate.\n<br>Once the device sends it location it then goes back to sleep mode, thus someone scanning for the device will not pick up a signal\n<br>Has a light sensor which when activated sends an emergency alarm to our office staff who then alert yourselves that your vehicle may be under threat\n<br>Works on quad band GSM and also operates with GPRS so the device will be able to send and receive globally and tell us where your vehicle is. (We are supported by Vodafone)\n<br>\n<br>Anyone from a technical background I am very happy to send over the technical data sheet for you to look at. \n<br>\n<br>In essence the thief knows most vehicles of worth now have trackers, they also know how to beat the tracker. Our device which is designed in house and has insurance approval is one step ahead of the thief again.\n<br>\n<br>I don't want to come across as a salesman on here as the device once viewed and understood correctly sells itself at a price below almost every tracker companies price.\n<br>\n<br>VW's are getting stolen and we have a device that can find them once stolen.\n<br>\n<br>Again anymore interest or questions please feel free to call me\n<br>\n<br>many thanks \n<br>\n<br>Simon \n<br>\n<br>07901513172\n<br>\n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.apultd.co.uk\">www.apultd.co.uk</a>\n<!-- w -->",

    "content" : "Ok the best way to answer is the device works in exactly the same way as it does when its in the open air or in normal condition, the issue with underground or steel containers is that the carrier waves (effectively radio waves in Mhz Ghz spectrum such as GSM plus GPS all rely on the transmission carrier waves penetrating the environment. Underground locations absorb the energy (particularly water/damp) so there is no transmission possible (for any device) and similarly in steel containers the steel/metal shields and absorbs the carrier waves but the absorption spectrum is not the same for all frequencies so the higher frequencies are shielded better than lower frequencies, hence why we use lower frequency bands.",

    "content" : "Morning Ziggy\n<br>\n<br>thank you for the question, \n<br>\n<br>Tracker products are great at what they do and do everything they say they will.\n<br>\n<br>However based on pure facts and everyday dealings of looking after a fleet of vehicles of 2246 cars that range from Renault Clios - Bentleys it is becoming ever more increasing that the thief knows where trackers are located in vehicles (simple when you think they need to be located close enough to front of the vehicle so they can be wired in to gain power supply), and more importantly the thief knows how trackers operate.\n<br>\n<br>They report their location by whatever means possible constantly. The thief simply jams the signal, scans and looks for device then takes it out. Tracking unit is now disabled.\n<br>\n<br>Our ARU device can be placed anywhere in the vehicle, does not constantly report its position (excellent for VIP's and showbiz who we work with as they don't want to be personally tracked all the time) and if our device is exposed to light it sends an emergency signal with its current location telling us that it is under threat.\n<br>\n<br>Like I said Tracking branded products do what they say they will and we actually use them on our fleet of vehicles but more so for our fleet manager to make sure our company vehicles are out on the road and at the right place at the right time.\n<br>\n<br>However looking after £50 million's worth of vehicles we are working with companies who are getting vehicles stolen on a weekly basis by organised crime gangs. \n<br>\n<br>It is our device the ARU that is giving us the success of finding the cars and not the Tracking units as more than often after 24hrs of vehicle being stolen the tracker is disabled.\n<br>\n<br>Real time situation = a client has a Lexus GS stolen 2 weeks ago, 2 devices attached, 1 x tracker 1 x our device. Yesterday our device reported the location of the vehicle is Oman. Tracker not reported for 5 days now! \n<br>\n<br>Not a good situation for the owner but the device is proving a lot of its features at the moment:\n<br>\n<br>Worldwide location reporting\n<br>even if the battery was disconnected for the time car was in a container our device still has power \n<br>\n<br>We are now working on a plan to recover the vehicle...great real time exercise for us guys.",
