I'm spending more time on the bus than with my family at the mo and my wife knows how to pour and light petrol in a very effective way!!\n<br> \n<br> I've a 65 split that has been straight axled, with a later 1200 beetle box and runs a fairly new 1641 TP type 1 engine.

It was a LUK 200mm job, but didn't look too worn (as I said, I'm new to aircooled so I didn't know how worn is worn, if you catch my drift) It was dry and no oil about in the bell housing. Ordered up a full new LUK setup and replaced it including the bearing. Checked the clutch fork and this is a fully welded up one and looked fine. Flywheel fine too. Put all back together, screwing the clutch cable back a little too as it was easy to get too.\n<br> \n<br> Put the engine back in after doing the welding and started her up. Clutch was miles out of adjustment so wound it back towards the end of the cable. Still slipped, so wound it back again. Still the case and I am back to square 1 here. Slipping clutch with no adjustment left. Have I missed something? does the cable outer slip and does this affect how it works? is the wrong cable fitted or are all bus ones the same? can the other end (pedal) jump off and not settle properly? once in a while the pedal sticks down now too?? can the clutch operating arm on the outside of the gearbox move, throwing it all out?\n<br> \n<br> Any idea's as I have to do it on the drive, I'm getting too old for this and most of the time it's raining here!!\n<br> \n<br> I love my bus, but this is driving a wedge between the rest of us!!!",

I had a problem with mine seizing recentely, worth a try! When the cable is disconected the pedal should fall to the floor! try that first and maybe in the meantime we can think of some more ideas!\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Chin up \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Andy",

    "content" : "Thanks all, much appreciated. just need to get to the bottom of it.\n<br> I'll try and clarify and add more detail.\n<br> \n<br> If the cable was currently longer than it is, I could screw out the wing nut further and this would remove the slipping, its almost as if the cable is not long enough and the bearing is still engaging with the pressure plate (if that makes sense), so if I replaced it with a new cable (unstretched) , would that not be shorter? Is there a chance it has a bay one fitted or should have a bay one fitted? are they any different in lenght?\n<br> \n<br> The pedal is nice and free, I've not looked at the clevis pin, but that will be my next port of call. The pedal has only stuck down since doing this work, once I had backed of the cable adjuster to almost the end, it has not stuck. \n<br> \n<br> The fork at the gearbox is in good order, not sticking or slack in its housing, not bent inside, well lubed and it looks new to be honest. The spring is in place and again, looks in good order.\n<br> \n<br> Jim, as yu know, the clutch cable has a outer, if this has slipped or jammed, would that cause this problem, almost shortening the iner because the out had jammed on something? The reason I mention this is that I read somewhere about the need for the outer to have 1/2 to 3/4 inch slack in it (or is this not anything to do with it?)\n<br> \n<br> At the other end, could the cable jump where it connects to the pedal mechanism and in effect shorten the cable lenght?\n<br> \n<br> Your comments are much appreciated gent's, a light at the end of the tunnel so to speak.",
