So I thought must take it off. So then I was thinking about when you buy a second hand car or bike how do you know if it has Tax or not.\n<br>\n<br>So got home and was chatting to Clare about it ( who seemed to be quite well informed on it all \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> ) and she said \"well you don't but it with Tax anymore, you have to buy it when you buy the car \"\n<br>\n<br>So how doers it work then ?\n<br>\n<br>Say I buy a 2nd hand car, the current owner claims any road tax back, but obviously I cannot drive it on the road until I have got tax for it, do you phone up the DVLA on the day and pay for it there and then?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Confused of Gosport \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">",

    "content" : "it maybe me but I smell a bit of sharp practice in this new system\n<br>\n<br>Previously a car could be taxed and carried over to the new owner who then taxed it as of the new expriy date, so one could argue that the car has 12 months paid on it\n<br>\n<br>I just sold a car on the 3 March. The new owner had to Tax if from the 1st March and I only get refunded from the 1st April as March was not a full month. SO now that car has had effectively thirteen months tax paid on it?\n<br>\n<br>On average then each private sale is going to mean that the seller gets refunded from the 1st of the next month and the buyer pays from the first of the current month. Have they just worked out a way of effectively taxing a car twice in the month its sold?? Am I missing a point and getting irritated for nothing, or have they just worked out a way of gaining more tax in a system that to me seems unfair? My rather simple maths means each private sale (assuming traders take the tax off and it sits there for a bit) is going to boost the coffers on that vehicle tax by 8%?",

As for the grey area between picking up the keys, taking ownership and driving away and getting it taxed, on the basis you're not going to drive it away without it being insured, in theory a phone call to the DVLA should see it taxed before you start moving off. Assuming you speak to someone sensible at the DVLA.",
