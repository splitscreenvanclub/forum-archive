    "content" : "February 1951 Non rear window signwritten panelvan ‘Stella Choklad’\n<br>\n<br>As far as early commercials go, this is hard to beat. Pre 10,000 chassis number barndoor panelvan, supplied in primer, then signwritten in Sweden in Brown and Cream with Stella Choklad livery. Its the second oldest signwritten Volkswagen surviving in the world.\n<br>\n<br>This was due to be sold to a good friend of mine, however he now also has to buy a house, so is unable to purchase it from me. I bought it 4 years ago off Chris at Musclebus Auto. Chris had already fitted a new centre chassis to the bus, so it now has some integrity to it. It was pretty complete when he imported it from Sweden, and he carefully took the components off and stored them to start the metalwork. The bottom end of the van was where it needed most work, hence the replacement middle chassis, but the main structures including the 1 year only seat base, engine bay, upper pillars and roof are all sound. It still has its original cab doors and door tops with original glass, the door tops are in good condition, but the lower doors do need repairs. \n<br>\n<br>All the hard to find stuff like wiper mechanisms and motor are also included, and it still has its extremely rare cast ali 1 year only front badge. It still has its original crash gearbox and beam too, along with its original dash pod, column and steering wheel. \n<br>\n<br>This is in Bristol with me, and I am asking £35,000 OBO for it. Happy to ship/deliver, give me a call on 07866618267 if you want to have a chat about it, more than welcome to come and take a look at it at my house. Here is a link to an old build thread that Chris started when he owned it, I have more pictures available on request.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=45258\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=45258</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/IMG_2664_1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/IMG_2656.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/P1020893.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/P1020858.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
