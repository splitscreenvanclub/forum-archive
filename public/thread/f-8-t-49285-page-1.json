    "content" : "Hey chaps... I have needed some inspiration recently and have read many, many threads here in R &amp; P and loved them all... so here is mine... \n<br>\n<br>Started out as a pretty solid swedish school bus... Imported by FBI I believe... sold on to Shaun at 50-67.com... then came my way as he had way to many projects on the go... \n<br>\n<br>This is Day 1... been dragged off for some welding early 2003... \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/day1-3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Then down the farm for a years worth of work...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/chacewater1-3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/chacewater-2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>By summer 2004 it was in one piece and on the road...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/jamboree04-4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Fast forward another couple of years and here we are today...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/finalfling.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/jamboree08-4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Now its locked up and about to get stripped again... well as soon as Christmas is out the way!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd81/acmecustom/010-6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>First on the list is a new full headlining... been experimenting with foam and vinyls for a week or so and I think I have finally decided which way to go... A foam backed 3mm light grey brushed nylon. Wanna make sure it brightens up the back... Then the hurst comes off for a make over... Then strip everything off everything, trim, bumpers, safaris... lights... racks.. ... remove ALL lacquer... which took me 3 days last time!!! And give 5 coats of homebrewed super satin.... Cant wait to get stuck in \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>Best of luck to everyone else working in a cold garage!! We all know its well worth it in the end... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

After spending most of today looking I have a solution now. I will be replacing the 3mm rubbery neopreme... then laying on a light grey brushed nylon that has a 3mm foam backing... Should make it nice and cosy. Also the upper dark grey panels are coming back off for a face lift now too... cant wait to get this done!!!",
