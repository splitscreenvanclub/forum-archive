It needs a better spacer. So I had a measure and marked out a bit of 3mm steel\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2999_zpsk222vrpx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2999_zpsk222vrpx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and gradually opened up the holes\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG3000_zps1n1uov1u.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG3000_zps1n1uov1u.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>While the metal and the drill were cooling down I worked out which door puller would make the cab door lock open fully and it turned out to be the grottiest one I had……. so that had a good clean up and the cab door now works well…..or it would if it would shut….that's an imminent job \"to do.\"\n<br>\n<br>When my step drill was no longer big enough I resorted to the burr grinder\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG3001_zpsqwfn7ar0.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG3001_zpsqwfn7ar0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>so here it is on top of the bought speed shifter spacer\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG3002_zpstzcvlbbr.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG3002_zpstzcvlbbr.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>there's a bit more now for the shifter base to mount to. I bolted the stick on and got it selecting gears, feeling quite positive and \"notchy.\" I don't know what it should feel like though so I'm going to try packing one more small washer on the underside of the floor to shim it a tad more to see how that feels. Then I can finish of the spacer. I made a start with the shaping. Then I need to weld on some sides…..\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG3003_zpsqxfblqzn.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG3003_zpsqxfblqzn.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I had about a half hour left at this point so fitted the cargo door handles. All my handles will have to go off for chroming but I think I'll sort that out over the winter. They'll do until then….\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG3004_zpsk81bll7k.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG3004_zpsk81bll7k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>That's it,\n<br>\n<br>cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Steve",
