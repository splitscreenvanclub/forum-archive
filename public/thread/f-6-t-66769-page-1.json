At the front the pedal is connected to a 13/16\" Master cylinder and then the fluid runs through a JIC-4 hose to a 5/8\" Wilwood Slave cylinder.\n<br>\n<br>The gearbox is from a Porsche 914 so its a bit different. The slave cylinder is jammed in a very tight gap beside the gearbox.\n<br>\n<br>You can buy a kit to install this type of hydraulic clutch system for a bus from Creative Engineering, mine is home made.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/10072009191.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/10072009192.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/10072009193.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
