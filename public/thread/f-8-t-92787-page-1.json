I `ve had quite a few aircooled vdubs over the years, but this is my first split. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> I went to view it a few weeks ago at Volksheaven and realised its exactly what i`m after - completely rot free - apparantly it came from some farm area in california where it stood for probably 20 years or so being used mainly for gun target practice and home to the local rat population!\n<br> \n<br> One thing thats intersting is that its fitted with a Chevy Corvair engine - i`d never heard of these before, but its a flat 6 aircooled engine from the 60`s that was a popular conversion in the states. I`ve checked the numbers on it and getting some help from some guys on a US corvair forum, it looks like its a 1965 2.7l 110bhp \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> I`ve had a good look at it since the van arrived and i think i`m going to give it a go getting it running as it`d be a bit different but a period engine. The engine bay hasn`t been cut up which is good and i have a donor 1500 vw engine to go in if it doesn`t work out.\n<br> \n<br> Here`s a few pics -\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1213.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1191.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1089.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1198.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1209.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/75169080/van/diary/initial/IMAG1207.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

You could probably fabricate a plate to make the engine lid stand off at the top, kind of like beetle stand offs. Given overheating issues, reliability and cost implications of parts I think I'd be tempted to sell the engine and invest the money into the resto or rebuilding/replacing the other engine although its nice to have something different\n<br> Much as I hate to chunder on your chips, I read an article in a mag a few years back which was looking at vintage power upgrades and the view was that compared to modern upgrades available now the bhp/Â£ makes it quite an expensive hobby. \n<br> Bodywork looks fairly solid and I'm loving them windows. What's the plan, run it as it is knocks and scrapes and all.....hope so, looks cool as it is (maybe a lower though, but that's just my opinion). Any pics of the underneath or the cargo floor and what's the plan to sort out the missing bulkhead. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee",
