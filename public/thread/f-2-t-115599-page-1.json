    "content" : "What with the introduction of a couple of spogs to my family, I've been away from the show scene for about 6 or so years. As such I've lost touch with what's about really.\n<br> \n<br> Can anyone recommend any shows (preferably fairly chilled and suitable for kids, maybe with some bands on the night) in and around the midlands area? We used to go to Vanfest, Stanford Hall, Bug Jam, BVF etc but all seemed to outgrow themselves from what I remember. There seems to be loads of different (smaller?) shows around now, but wondering what other people think of them?\n<br> \n<br> Also is there a convoy from Victoria farm to Stanford Hall this year? Was thinking about doing that, although last time I went to Stanford Hall it had been moved to the bank holiday weekend and was way too busy.",

    "content" : "Stanford Hall is on Sunday 1st May this year and yes it does get busy but still one of the best shows of the calendar if you ask me (which most don't \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">) Very family friendly as in not populated by spliff-heads and morons. \n<br> VW Action is an awesome show and again, very busy but not anywhere as much as bug jam. I'd happily take my 2 yr old to Action and there's loads to keep kids entertained with racing (ear guards are a must) plus a funfair and bands in the evening. \n<br> I took my lad to Bug Jam last year and to be honest it was a big mistake as he was deffo too young and let's face it, bug jam is bug jam so the moron element are in abundance. I'll be there this year as I love it but it's no place for little kids, maybe 10yrs+ but not toddlers. \n<br> If you fancy venturing farther afield Battlesbridge in Essex is a nice chilled family show again with bands. The main day is the Sunday but folk go from Friday evening to set up, catch up and chill out. \n<br> Hope that helps \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br> \n<br> Cheers, Lee.",
