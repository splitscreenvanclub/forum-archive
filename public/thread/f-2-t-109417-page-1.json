    "content" : "OK, with the sad demise f my camper recently, along with it went my old skool audio set-up I had collected and had installed over the years. It was old, but had a good sound to it. \n<br>\n<br>Upfront I had the following;\n<br>Alpine CDA-9813R 60w head-unit driving\n<br>Alpine SXE 1350S component speakers\n<br>Alpine KCA-420i iPod connector\n<br>\n<br>In the back I had;\n<br>Alpine SWR1021D subwoofer\n<br>Driven by a Rockford Fossgate 60w Punch amp\n<br>Plus a pair of FNQ1406 6-1/2\" Rockford Fosgate Fanatic Q Mid-Bass speakers Driven by a Rockford Fossgate 40w Punch amp\n<br>\n<br>Unfortunately it is all now destroyed and so I need another system \n<br>\n<br>Any suggestions or advice as as to what sort of route to go? Is it worth looking a complete new system (out of touch with what's what) or look at maybe another older system of component parts again? \n<br>\n<br>I suspect my budget from insurance will be pathetically small (£500), but I can look to add to this to get a decent sounding system.",
