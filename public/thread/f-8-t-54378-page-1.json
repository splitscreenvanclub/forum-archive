    "content" : "Well its been a long time coming and tons of typing and posting up of pictures. So here it is – the story so far. Hope it’s not too boring for you all and you like me have learnt a lot though trial, error, kind advice and lots of head scratching.\n<br>\n<br>We had been looking far and wide for our 1st ever aircooled and it had to be a splittie. We looked a so many rough ones, long chases around the country to be letdown/disappointed before another long session on the dreaded E-bay our Ghub came up. These were the pics posted…\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/cd31_1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/cee1_1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/100_2071.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/100_2061.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/100_2062.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>These were from the chap who imported her in 2005/6 as she arrived. How different she was then. She had a bit of a rub down with 1500 grade wet and dry by Darrens Son and had a tickle with the lowering stick. A drop 1 spline on the rear and adjusters to the front beam. apparently the yellow was very custard looking and not too nice in real life.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/GHUBfromAmerica1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/GHUBfromAmerica2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>After a quick trip down to Banbury to meet her and Darren and his great family we shook on a deal and we headed home to sort out the money and stuff to return the following week to collect her. All week I was wishing it to pass quickly to go and get her.\n<br>\n<br>I took the train down with my trusty tool-box and was met at the station by Darren. Emily had to go to work so had to stay behind. The anticipation and excitement was unbelievable. A hurried exchange as I was desparate to get behid the wheel and I was off back up the M40 home. I stopped for petrol and a couple of photos on the way..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/Photo211.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/Photo212.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Too late, bitten by the bug and total addiction has followed. \n<br>\n<br>She is a 1964 Sportsmobile. Has her stock 1500cc single port engine and generally solid all round. Never been welded or in need (till now – will come on to that later). Her interior was very tired, dark and gloomy and had no headlining. \n<br>\n<br>The money pit looms.\n<br>\n<br>Once home things started to go a little wayward – icing up of the carb, popping out of 4th now and again. Not too bad though given her years I thought. We pottered around grinning like lunatics. Bryony (8 then) loved her but it was now way cool enough for Joe (13 then) who hid in the back and pulled the curtains down incase he was seen!\n<br>\n<br>We met Simon from \n<span class=\"posthilit\">Absolute</span> \n<span class=\"posthilit\">VW</span> in Castle Donington who took her into his trusted care and get her a once over. A good service, relocated the external oil cooler and filter, fitted dual circuit master cylinder, secured the battery, POR15 the underneath and Dinitrolled the cavities, sorted brakes and numerous other tinkering.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/DSCF0323.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/simoncameradownload4April010.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/blog/simoncameradownload4April006.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Not sure on them but got these shoes for her – not for much longer..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/Van%20Works/Picture014.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The gearbox got worse and worse and gave up on 4th on the way back from seeing my brother in Swindon. We had to drive to our first ever Vic farm in 3rd all the way. Poor old girl needed a little love. !st ever campout = was brilliant!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/Vic%20Farm%202007/2007_0505Vic_Farm0006.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>More chasing around the country and many thanks to people here I sourced creative enginering IRS bits and bobs. Back to Dr Simon who performed immaculate surgery to her again and out she rode with a new rear end inc DC code gearbox. All nicely powder coated.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/23May058.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune106-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/23May128.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/23May118.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune168.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune161.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune062.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune047.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune053-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune036.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune031.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune030.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w224/simons121/New%20IRS/1stJune029.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>To be continued...",
