He's in a bit of a bad way, but as you can see, the benefit of an A level in metalwork from a long time ago is paying dividends and I've cracked on. He weighs a lot less now and I've just taken him to be blasted.<br><br>Thanks to the many interesting posts on here I'm getting an idea of how to proceed but will undoubtedly ask many daft questions as I've never done anything like this before!<br><br>So here goes, daft first question - several of you raise the height of the steering box. Why is this? I'd guess at lowering the ride height? <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> <br><br>Any help, or tips greatly appreciated, and can anyone tell me how to post more pic's?<br><br>Steve<br><br></span>",
