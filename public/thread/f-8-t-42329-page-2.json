You see I have a few tricks planned for this build and I decided it would be nearly as much work to modify a solid chassis as it would to build my own from scratch. Plus this way a beautifully solid chassis doesn't get harmed. \n<br>So, next job is order up a large Klassicfab Meccano set and get welding. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>Something else cool about the bus that may help me look a tiny bit less insane. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>Finland is like Sweden in that a member of the VW community has managed to get a hold of all the old records which show detailed accounts of Volkswagen imports and sales in the country. The records for my bus where included. Here is a bit of what they say. \n<br>The bus was built on 25th June 1952 \n<br>Left the factory on 26th June to a dealership in Tempere, Finland. \n<br>The dealership then sold the samba to a private owner on 27th July 1952 who registered it on the 18th August and drove it until 1967 when he parked it in a wood near his house. Here it stayed until I became the new owner. \n<br>So yes I am only the 3rd owner from factory. 2nd if you don't count the dealership. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> Shame the second owner didn't look after it a bit better. But I guess if he had then I doubt I could have afforded it. \n<br>The speedo disappeared at some point, stolen as the guy never gave permission for it to go. Shame because the bus seems to have stayed within a very small area its whole life and the mileage I guess could have been very small. \n<br>I hope to get a lot more info and cool pictures in the future as at least the second owner is still alive, so if I can finish it before they die i'll take them for a spin and get some more info.",
