And the light is too blue, so needs warming up a bit..\n<br>\n<br>I've got a few PITA jobs coming up actually:\n<br>Install gearstick (needs someone to climb under the bus to hold linkage)\n<br>Secure dimmer switch (I want to use a screw with a bolt rather than self tappers, so need to climb under van to fit)\n<br>Trim passenger side pedestal. This is a bit of a ******* of a job actually as it requires fitting the seat back cover and getting it trimmed nicely, then fitting a metal trim, which needs cutting and bending around the base, before fitting the rubber base mat. \n<br>\n<br>Don't suppose you're going to be bored at all this weekend and fancy a couple of hours messing around with someone elses van do you? The metal trim shaping is the one that's vexing me the most at the moment.\n<br>\n<br>I cant do the drivers side yet, as I need a new cover made, which I'll get sent to my hotel wen I'm in Vegas in a few weeks, along with some matching vinyl to cover the 3 luggage area panels.\n<br>\n<br>The bunks and bellows ribs are at the powder coaters at the moment. Once the last of the interior is done, I can concentrate on the roof!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\">",
