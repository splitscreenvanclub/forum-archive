The more I peel back the sealer stuck in holes and fake tin stuck over rotten original chassis members the worse I feel for you guys and the more anger I feel towards whoever did this dishonest cover up. But we're best to forget them and enjoy moving forward, I can't wait to move it forward for you and see the smiles when its all done. I'll send you some more pics a bit later buddy.",
