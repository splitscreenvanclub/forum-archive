If I was to buy the bus I'd want to find a replacement. Are they easy to get hold of and where's the best place to look?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks,\n<br>\n<br>Mark\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

So even if I'm lucky enough to get one I'm maybe looking at about £1000 (+) by the time it's welded and painted.
