Mainly cos it was the cheapest option but also figured i could change it if needed.\n<br> \n<br> I have had no problems with it being too low... only ground coming out of my drive which is stupidly steep. Towed a dandy tent nice and level no problem. Think the ball is approx 35 cm from the floor... can check if it helps.\n<br> \n<br> Knowing that it works i kind of wish id gone for the swan neck as it looks a bit more proper.",

I think the swan neck would sit at same height with same clearance underneath.\n<br> \n<br> I seem to recall that there are guidelines/specifications about minimum ball height and 35/36 cm was as low as is advised iirc.\n<br> \n<br> From my experience i havent had any problems with the height but i wouldnt want it any lower. My dandy tent sits level with the van when all hitched up. The removable plate was going to be my plan b if current set up was too low. \n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps",
