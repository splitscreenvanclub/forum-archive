    "content" : "Hello,\n<br> Does anyone have any contact addresses for Alex Bell? Or know where he keeps his buses and parts? I think I need to hire a private investigator to retrieve some property he has stolen.\n<br> \n<br> Alex used to run so23westfalia.com and is now running \n<a href=\"http://transporterhaus.de/\" class=\"postlink\">http://transporterhaus.de/</a>\n<br> \n<br> About 10-12 years ago he borrowed a 1956 Westfalia bedframe from a friend of mine, and collected a check from him for around $2000-3000 U.S. He was loaned this bed frame to be used a template to reproduce more.\n<br> \n<br> He has since disappeared with the bed, the cash, and has had a very bad habit of ignoring emails for the past 10 years.\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, the bus is almost finished:\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.kustomcoachwerks.com/forums//viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=8557&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.kustomcoachwerks.com/forums/ ... 57&amp;start=0</a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.kustomcoachwerks.com/gallery3/var/resizes/Type-2/KBs-56-spring-frame-westfalia/DSCF0926.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> And it needs a bed!!!!\n<br> \n<br> In February I reached out to him, told him the owner was prepared to forgive the $2000-3000 cash, only wanted his bed back, and was willing to pay to have it packed up and shipped home. I also said I would pay to have someone come around to collect it from whatever shop he had it stored at. He was very communicative at first and said he'd get it handled within a week or two, very apologetic about having it for 10-12 years with zero communication. \n<br> \n<br> Then he just dropped off the grid, has ignored dozens of emails. \n<br> \n<br> Anyone know how to get through to him?\n<br> \n<br> I'd be prepared to offer a reward for any information that allowed me to collect these stolen parts.",

If transporterhaus is selling on eBay, does anyone have a return address? \n<br> \n<br> Hopefully at some point the bed will get returned, absolutely no sense in Alex keeping it for 10+ years.\n<br> \n<br> If he owes money or parts to anyone else, come forward!\n<br> \n<br> I know often people are hestitant to come forward. I don't like posting anything negative about the guy, at one point he seemed to be a good character, at this point? You be the judge. Ten years is a long time! A bed-frame worth who knows how much, $3000, and super crappy communication, what else is there to do at this point but try and smoke the guy out?\n<br> \n<br> I cant imagine doing business with any of his companies until this gets resolved.",

Very sad. Hopefully he was able to comfort or compensate the owner of it somehow.",

I don't think it was exactly left for ten years but when a hundred emails get ignored over a 10 year period and on the off chance he did get a response it was full of promises that things would get wrapped up shortly.\n<br> \n<br> Again, it's not about the money, or any owed parts, or even the timeline.

We've just reached the end of the line here and I'm not sure how to get through to him.\n<br> \n<br> The bus is almost finished and the owner just wants his original bed frame back that he loaned Alex and he would be fine with paying shipping and a reward to someone who can help facilitate that happening.",
