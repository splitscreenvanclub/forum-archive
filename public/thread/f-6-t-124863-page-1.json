Now it’s all dry again only the battery light comes on.\n<br> \n<br> I know the bulb works, there is power to the speedo as all the other lights/instruments are working. The wiring loom is only a couple of years old so pretty confident that is ok.\n<br> \n<br> I have tried removing the wire from the pressure switch and earthing, but still nothing happened. What do I need to try next please.",

Can get it to work, but the slightest bump in the road and it becomes useless... just need to wedge it over with some electrical tape or something.\n<br> \n<br> Very frustrating that it took the two hottest days of the year to figure that out!\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> Carl",
