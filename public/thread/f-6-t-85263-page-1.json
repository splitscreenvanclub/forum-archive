    "content" : "The gearbox in our van is making quite load rumbling noises, which seem to have got worse recently.\n<br>\n<br>The rumbling noise is there from start up when in neutral - it goes away when the clutch is fully depressed. The noise seems to get worse when pulling away - either stationary or accelerating, or engine braking. If you press the clutch when travelling the noise goes away even if it is still in gear, the same goes for coasting - until engine braking begins.\n<br>\n<br>I don't think it's as bad in reverse - but i just might not have paid as much attention \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>Gearbox oil was changed a few weeks ago which seemed to make it worse \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I got a local garage to do it while they were checking the carbs and timing. They put standard 80/90 hypoid in.\n<br>\n<br>I changed the oil again this week for peace of mind - this time with Fuchs Titan synthetic 80w90 Hypoid and stuck in a tube of Forte diff treatment too. This seems to have quietened it slightly but not much \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>The magnetic drain plug was a bit furry when I pulled it out - not sure if the garage cleaned it the other week though \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> There were no big lumps or gritty bits just small silver flakes - more like copperslip type consistency.\n<br>\n<br>Gearbox is a 1500 beetle unit (AH I think) mated to an 2007cc engine - bus is straight axled.\n<br>\n<br>The box came from Jonesy at Boatyard buses (He didn't rip me off either, got rather a good deal actually \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> ). John Walklett then gave it a once over and welded 3rd and 4th - he said it looked to be in very good condition.\n<br>\n<br>The S/A conversion was done by a guy in Leeds around April time last year.\n<br>\n<br>We've done around 6-7000 miles on it since then.\n<br>\n<br>Any suggestions / questions welcomed.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers",

The noise disappears when the release bearing is being used and loaded up - surely if it was failing it would make some sort of noise then? It doesn't \"feel\" like that sort of noise.\n<br>\n<br>Input shaft bearing sounds, unfortunately, more likely - the noise is there only when there is some sort of loading between the input shaft and the engine. ie. Setting off, accelerating, engine braking. Bugger.\n<br>\n<br>I'm not sure whether the garage cleaned the plug? So it's either 2 weekd of build-up, or 7000 miles. I would say a mix of fines and very small flakes - you couldn't feel the particles in a gritty way, just see them.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers.",
