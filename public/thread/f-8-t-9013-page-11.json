I dropped the engine this morning and Paul (Ebenezer) very kindly donated a beetle engine and we set about fitting it. \n<br> \n<br> Had to swap my alternator over onto it, house its remote oil filter on my bus and swap fuel pumps, so it wasn't a record breaker. \n<br> \n<br> I think I ran out of petrol en route to the testing station and couldn't get it started again as the battery was a bit dodgy. I stupidly shorted the jump leads and blew a fuse on the bus - and I don't have any spare reds(!) Couldn't jump it from my car for some reason, so it was towed home. The MoT bloke said to bring it back tomorrow morning at 11. So even if by a miracle it passes, no convoy for me this year. \n<br> \n<br> The tracking was miles out and the steering was everywhere. Brakes were non-existent for some reason and the throttle linkage is dodgy and very difficult to get any revs. So a little list of things to do before 11 tomorrow. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> I don't care though. I drove my bus and I have video to prove it. \n<br> \n<br> The mileage now reads 69161, having read 69159 since I bought it all those years ago. \n<br> \n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
