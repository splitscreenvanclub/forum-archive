    "content" : "Tartan Material for interior panels of bus. These were the interior panels of my bus before it's current restoration. I was wanting to use them again but we put the matching seat cushions in storage and a mouse promptly ate them !! Really p****d off as this material cost hundred's of pounds. So took 18 months finding a material that was similar. So I would really like to see this have a second life. My bus is a walkthrough but I rescued one panel of a seat cushion and there is some of the original material spare so you should be able to cover the bulkhead,the material fits the front doors, cargo doors and long side panel plus walkthrough or full length bulkhead. The colour goes really well with sealing wax red or coral buses's . I enclose a photo of the material draped on one of my old door panel's. The material has been thoroughly washed, is not perfect but pretty good and will probably need a bit of a stretch as I washed it at 60 degree's. Only asking £30 as I would love to see it used again (I genuinely cried when that bloody mouse had it's way)\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49842228653_4c88232c38_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49842672777_058844f5a8_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
