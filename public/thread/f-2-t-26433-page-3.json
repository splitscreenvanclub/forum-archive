'LOL' at the end of a message makes me want to punch the author in the face, no matter how amusing their tale may have been. My now 11yr old son asks why I write text messages in longhand and, shock horror, use punctuation!! 'Because otherwise it is just wrong' is my answer, which I do believe is actually a rather poor answer grammatically.",

I'm on a grand tour of Europe in Lily, my 63 splittie and recently found myself in a spot of bother with the electrics in here. Anything like this is beyond me, and I'm quite happy to put my hands up and say it needs a mans look! Trusty google wasn't bringing up any vw repairers in the area, so I had I spend my day going from caravan shop to garage and back again, before I was finally recommended to a place called Freisland Krevers - \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mooney.nl\">http://www.mooney.nl</a>\n<!-- m --> who were really helpful in getting me back on the road. \n<br>\n<br>So basically - if you are looking at doing one for Europe, make sure you get these guys in The Netherlands on the list!\n<br>\n<br>I'm away for 5 months so sure to need more help along the way, so I am happy to post details in here?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Amy &amp; Lily!",
