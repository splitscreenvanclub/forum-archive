(Before anyone asks yes the starter motor is a Corvair one with an adapter to fit VW boxes the engine still runs backwards) \n<br> The engine came out of a Splitscreen which was married up to a standard VW gearbox, this was a while ago &amp; the bus has been sold. Dose anyone have a Bell Housing or Gearbox I can borrow for a day, I live in Woking, Surrey \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji120.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji1009.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Craig \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
