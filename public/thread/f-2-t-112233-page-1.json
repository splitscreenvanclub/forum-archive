    "content" : "I imported 63 vert bug from a private seller in New England...as above got him to send plenty of pics and then spoke over the phone to discuss shipping etc...all turned out well.\n<br>\n<br>Had a less fruitful purchase of a split from another seller and only had email contact....got a bit frustrated with time scales (he was a bit too laid back) as months passed with sketchy contact. He was vouched for on samba and elsewhere but in the end I got the local fraud squad involved and after a visit from LAPD (and threat of possible felony) it was all resolved and funds were returned to me. I have no doubt that the guy would have come good eventually but after a couple of months with no contact I got a bit twitchy (also got a severe scalding from my better half) - only mention it as there are steps that can be taken in a 'worse case scenario ' if things were to go pear shaped.\n<br>\n<br>Always a.bit of a gamble but if you have the seller's genuine details you can protect yourself to some degree.\n<br>\n<br>On each occasion I paid a % of agreed price with agreement that full funds would be sent following confirmation from shipping company that the vehicles were on their way/due to be collected. - Obviously this only happened first time round.",

    "content" : "I've imported 5 from the States the most recent arrived last Thursady. My experience is that generally speaking most seem pretty honest....but do as Ben says and check the feedback and also as Shelltoes says...not everyone's idea of rust free is the same and that's certainly true in the States. Ask for pics...you can't have too many, and personally I always phone and talk to the seller...I think you can get a pretty good sense of how someone is when you speak to them. I've only ever dealt/bought through TheSamba and wouldn't go anywhere else except the other well established sellers like OldBug for instance.\n<br>Good luck...it's exciting too.",
