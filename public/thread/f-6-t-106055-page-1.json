The plasticiser from the vinyl migrates into the glue and turns it into a sticky non-adhesive mess. Same with evostik. Try to find a proper vinyl upholstery glue. I've used a PU based glue and it worked perfectly when sticking the headliner at the rear.",

We took our time and asked lots of questions beforehand, and Wonderland were happy to pass on tips and advice as promised. Recommended. \n<br> \n<br> Also we used the glue they recommended and supplied which worked really well. I did use quite a lot - about 4 cans, and I'd recommend replacing all the rubbers at the end of the headlining bows - you will need two of their packs to do this.\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps someone thinking of taking the plunge.........\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m145/Freddie846/Mobile%20Uploads/482349EA-38A1-465E-82B8-52B5452A280D_zpshcnaxnd6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">[/URL]\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i103.photobucket.com/albums/m145/Freddie846/Mobile%20Uploads/5F159837-811E-4B05-A202-39034C4A31C3_zps6pptael9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">[/URL]",
