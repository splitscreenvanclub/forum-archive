    "content" : "Hi\n<br>Don't think you can fit them wrong although it looks as though there has been a bit pressure on the strap were it snapped,probably were alternator sits on the stand.\n<br>I snapped two in quick succession recently,turned out to be the fan had elongated the mounting hole and the vibration snapped the straps,\n<br>needed a new fan in the end.\n<br>The chrome straps are poor quality,might be better with OEM one.",

    "content" : "Interesting marking where it has snapped......\n<br>In theory.....the strap relies on the force along the strap being spread over the width and length of the strap. .\n<br>So if it had been bent at some time that would introduce a possible weak point and stress raiser. .\n<br>Looks like corrosion may have contributed and when tightened up causes local high stress at the bent area and corrosion weakens further..\n<br>You clamp to stop movement and eventually it gives way. ..\n<br>\n<br>I think...",

    "content" : "Well I have ordered 2 replacement ones, One OG from Custom and commercial and then a chaepy one to have just in case it happens again.\n<br>So a bit of history on this. about a month ago, we were on our way home after a motorway drive and there was an intermittent noise that on inspection was the fan on the tinware, and yeah the strap had become loose some how. So that would explain some bits I guess.\n<br>\n<br>Hopefully the OEM one will be good and when fitted correctly last a time.\n<br>\n<br>I did get home from work today and make one myself, just like the cheapy ones you get, But I have decided to wait for the OEM one.\n<br>\n<br>Andy",
