Some of my steel clips became weak and snapped. (Did not realise, apparently you can buy them, but this works too). Get some .22 bullet cartridges, squash and planish them in the vice, 10 secs work. Hey presto. Slide them down the trim, push though the door cards and twist and bend to lock in place. Saved making some from scratch! Cost nothing.",
