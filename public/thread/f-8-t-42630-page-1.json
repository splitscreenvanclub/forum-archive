    "content" : "Well, I've made a start at last...I'm waiting to \"Aquire\" some steel box section so I can make a rottisserie / Chassis roller. But in the mean time I decided to take the front panel off, mainly so I can treat and clean up all the metalwork behind the panel.\n<br>Did put a post up asking for a bit of advice on the best way to do this and I've decided to go for the option of cutting through the outer skin of the windscreen pillars.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/PIC_0046.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Mainly because where the bottom of the screen meets the top of the front panel, the only way I could find the spotwelds is to bend the metal up. Which then left creases / ripples in it.\n<br>So after removing 5 spot welds down each side of the A post and then seperating and removing the welds of the lower front screen it all came away quite nicely.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/PIC_0047.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The front panel itself is certainly re-useable, needs a repair section to the bottom and some repair work to the headlight bowls. And a bit of panel beating to the centre.\n<br>\n<br>Andy",

    "content" : "Well it’s certainly about time I updated what’s been going on with the project. It’s been a bit frustrating and I lost heart a bit lately. But I’ve been waiting 15 years to get the bus so I’m not about to give up on it!!\n<br>\n<br>I think it’s taking so long because I’m trying to do it right, do the bus justice, not just scrap bits, but try to salvage them, and then just some things just seem to take for ages.\n<br>\n<br>So looking back over the months, the first thing I did was to cut off the front panel. The inner and outer valances were shot as to were the bottom of the A Posts. I got the Klassic Fab panels as most places only seemed to do the Left hand drive inner valance which they said you could make fit !!!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Chassis%20Ends/PIC_0003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Bus%2030-11-08/PIC_0022.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Bus%2030-11-08/PIC_0023.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Once all the welding is done I'll be rolling the bus over and cleaning up all the underside and painting it.\n<br>\n<br>I’ve had to drill out ALL the screws that held the Cargo doors in place, they just wouldn’t budge, but I managed to drill them out ok and then run a Tap ( or is it a die ) just to clean the threaded back plate.\n<br>Same again for the rear hatch screws, again they all needed drilling out and a tap run in to clean……and funnily enough the same for the engine lid.\n<br>\n<br>Thankfully there all done now and all ok.\n<br>\n<br>I’ve repaired the hinges on both cab doors, did a little “how to”. Hopefully will be of use to other people! \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=48330\">viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=48330</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>\n<br>Using some wrong formed parts I’ve repaired the drivers side wheel arch.

That may be going on mext weekend. There were quite a few dents down the long sill plus I noticed that the inner sill needs a reapir so I thought I may as well just replace the outer completely.\n<br>\n<br>Had a bit of trouble with the Cargo door sill. When I put the new inner sill in place it was all a bit out, wouldn’t line up staright with the top hat sections and the I sections, \n<br>Got a bit of advice of the forum and some pics , so It’s all tacked in place and looking ok.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Bus%2030-11-08/PIC_0024.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The Passenger door is low at the b post end, hopefully when the passenger side floor is in place it will support the A post and bring the door in line.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Bus%2030-11-08/PIC_0025.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/Bus%2030-11-08/PIC_0026.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The sill will be spot welded along the bottom\n<br>\n<br>That's about it for now.\n<br>\n<br>Andy",
