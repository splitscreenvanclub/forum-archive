Rack is well made and strong….perhaps slats a little too thin but they can be replaced if necessary. I don;t yet know if it will fit with Dormy top…. it's tight. I'll cut a section out and reweld and powder if needs be. Will make a matching rear so that kayaks will fit.\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

Anyone who suffers from acute boredom or not wanting to hear of my woes should \"tune out\" now and go to a more interesting thread \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> However this is all part of \"Rusty's journey\" so is relevant (at least to me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> )\n<br>\n<br>I had a sore right eye on Sat afternoon and thought nothing of it, other than perhaps I had got something in it again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> or scratched it. I was working all Sunday but have little to show for it, in fact I can't remember what I did, but I do remember splashing some thinners in my eye at 4pm ish. At about 5pm ish, weird things started in my right eye and lots of 3D cobwebs and \"oily\" shapes appeared \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> all in 3D. On waking Monday, my vision was a blur and so I went to the opticians Monday pm, who couldn't find much wrong but booked me an appointment on Friday for some Tropicamide drops and a deeper investigation \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> I was, however not totally reassured as she appeared not to be much older than twelve and, although she may have had perfectly good results from Uni and the Royal College of Opthalmologists, you can't buy experience.\n<br>\n<br>Tuesday morning went by in a blur, literally, like looking through a smoky fire and on Tuesday night the Sheila ran me up to A &amp; E \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> After a three hour wait, the eye doctor couldn't find anything wrong and sent me home, promising to fax everything through to the relevant department who would contact me in due course………………\n<br>\n<br>Eye consulted Dr. Google ( there's a pun there \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> ) and spent several hours ringing the hospital on Wednesday morning, eventually getting someone interested who agreed to see me in his lunch break if I could get there by 12.30 (it was now 11.50 and it was a half hour away and was pi$$ing down)\n<br>\n<br>Long story short, Eye was seen and within an hour had my torn retina spot welded to the back of my eye with a laser (their words not mine). Things appear to have now stabilised but Eye struggled a bit today as Gary came back to do some more filler work \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>(Appently the thinners was probably coincidental and it would have happened anyway, mostly caused by……….aging \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> Not good, but I don't fancy the alternative \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> )\n<br>\n<br>Gary took one look at this and, unfortunately, it didn't pass muster \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1854_zpsoum7oufi.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1854_zpsoum7oufi.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and proceeded to slaver it over with some Upol \"Topstop Gold\" which is now my new filler of choice. I've learnt some more and and it's been nearly accepted. It's difficult with one eye not working but I know of another guy, similarly challenged, who hasn't made a bad job of his bus \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> so I've no excuses \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1855_zpsprajl7xb.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1855_zpsprajl7xb.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Meanwhile Gary got on with the front panel. He's beaten it into submission with his flipper, ably assisted by me when his arms weren't long enough, and although we need to do a little more welding in a couple of places, it's coming on. I'll let the pictures do the talking, but if I ever did another similar bus it would have a new WW front panel and a long side \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> That's experience again…….which you can't buy….\n<br>\n<br>I'd left it like this, having used up odd bits of filler here and there….\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1856_zpsjujvgmpk.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1856_zpsjujvgmpk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and then it started to improve, bit by bit\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1857_zpsf7exafob.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1857_zpsf7exafob.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1858_zpsbs82mh8r.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1858_zpsbs82mh8r.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>sorry, this next photo's out of focus, but is just about exactly what I'm seeing out of my right eye \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1859_zpsn2gvdgug.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1859_zpsn2gvdgug.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I couldn't resist at the end of a long day…..\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1860_zpsv39jgddl.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1860_zpsv39jgddl.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The high note for yesterday is that Paul from Bears Motorsport rang me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> The gearbox is finished and on it's way to me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I also today got a email from Paul at Harry Harpics and although he's a bit behind, due to powder coating delays and an imminent holiday, the engine's just about ready \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>I just wish I was……... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

He found some low spots and made me ladle a bit more on, and you can see. Apparently the \"Topstop Gold\" is more condusive to having different layers and you can spirit wipe it and it doesn't soak in, unlike the Fantastic.
