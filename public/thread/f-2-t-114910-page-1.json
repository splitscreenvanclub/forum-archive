    "content" : "I was thinking about what way to go with the front beam in my Barndoor. \n<br>I always thought I would have a narrowed late beam with Barndoor mounts to get the wheels tucked and out of the way of the doglegs. But I believe narrowed beams always run a little rougher then stock due to the shortened leaf springs. \n<br>But I've also heard barndoors run a little saggy at the front due to poorer and sometimes (non deluxes) less leaf springs. So would it not be a nice compromise to have a narrowed Barndoor beam? Where the shortened leaf springs actually improve the spring rate and make it more like a latter split?\n<br>Is this right, or am I missing something?\n<br>\n<br>One other thing. At the back, Barndoor torsion bars are shorter so does that make the ride firmer or are they softer to compromise?",

Daves windy window drive amazingly well. We have plans for ours now to get them even better. Give me a call if you want dude. Gareth",

    "content" : "Cheers dude. \n<br>It would always be basically a later beam. But was just wondering if there was some advantage in keeping the BD torsion leaves to ruduce the firmness. It would mean Barndoor trailing arms. But with 63 spindles I don't see any obvious disadvantage. \n<br>Anyway, just shooting ideas.",
