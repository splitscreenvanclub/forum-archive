    "content" : "Not sure if it's been covered on here before but a while ago I was doing a bit of research into the paint M codes on my Canterbury Pitt van. They show that it was originally painted, upper and lower, in pearl white. The earliest picture I have is with the van in two tone, sea blue and white. Who knows when the blue was actually added but I wondered if it was common practise to supply vans to the conversion companies in all white then for any additional paint to be added prior to sale.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks.",
