My understanding is that it as one year only optional extra and was discontinued as it cracked very easy on the seating. \n<br> Company's like TMI do not carry it as it is rarely ordered . Aunty Avetts did find me the steel blue but not the papyrus white that seems not to exist in the world now. (But did offer to make some for me)\n<br> The paint was sea blue and cumulus .\n<br> I have had my van almost 30 years and never seen another UK van with it. There seems to be plenty in the USA though.\n<br> G I would love to see some photos of David Balls if anyone has any ?",
