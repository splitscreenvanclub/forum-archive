    "content" : "Reported on here at the time when I fitted a VS exhaust system that performance was down by approx 15-20% both power and torque. Also had to turn the idle up as wouldn’t tick over. Bus used to pull from 22mph in 4th gear but with VS would only pull from 30mph. Decided to fit a CSP sidewinder system and performance back to ‘normal’. Bus pulls from 22 like a train. Pulls up the local hills so much better again. Also when I removed the VS system 2 of the exhaust gaskets were burnt and would have needed replacing. This is a problem others I have spoken to have reported. \n<br> Shame as the VS system looks cool....but clearly not good for performance. \n<br> \n<br> On a different note...VeeWee aka GSF’s new Heat Exchangers are spot on with correct internal fins and work very well producing really good heat \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",

Amazing torque which is what it was built for...best bus engine I’ve ever had. Will (now) pull from 22mph in 4th gear and cruise at 80mph...on the sat nav...so genuine 80mph and return over 30mpg fully loaded. Freeway Flier box.\n<br> \n<br> The VS system was the 125bhp version with HE’s. I commented on here before how I noticed a drop in performance as soon as I fitted it. The fact that it was burning gaskets (after 500 miles) and dropped the idle speed would suggest too much back pressure...I’ve heard that the internal design of the VS is crap....that’s from an exhaust engineer.\n<br> The down side with CSP is the price I guess...but then you get what you pay for eh?\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> As best as I can tell the VeeWee HE’s produce as much heat as the old OE ones. Big improvement over the CSP ones I had on the other bus...much better.\n<br> \n<br> All of this is just my experience \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
