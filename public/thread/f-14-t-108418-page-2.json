(im not sure whats happened)\n <br>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>Well it's a long story. Back in 2013 we were living in Portugal and struggling along (like everyone else over there!!). That was until my dad died and I came back with my family to sort everything out. It was not until we arrived at his house and realised there was a problem; my sister had been there and taken many things, most importantly she had taken all paperwork including his will. She then denied that he ever made a will and that's really where the trouble starts. It (well she) got really nasty, to the point that it was an aunty that told me when the funeral was as she had arranged it. To cut a long nasty story short, well we ran out of money to return and since the boys had to go to a school we stayed in the hope of eventually sorting things out. Everything I own, including my busses is stuck in Portugal - I hope it is still there!! We have been saving up to get our dogs back and maybe a van but it has been two steps forward and one step back. Lucikily my wife has found a good job, but because I have ankylosing spondylitis that was misdiagnosed (fused neck and spine) I have not been so lucky. I'm o.k. but may struggle getting under a van!! Things are getting better though, we have managed to rent a house with a garage, and last week I got a washing machine from oxfam!! (First one in 4 1/2 years, no more washing in the bath, yay!!). Things could have got me down, but thanks to some kind people on here and some other random acts of kindness, it hasn't. There are good people in the world and I glad to say that many of them are in this club. \n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Dom.",
