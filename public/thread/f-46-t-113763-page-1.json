Righto...\n<br>\n<br>MonkeyKnuts has a 62/63 interior search his build thread for reference pics. \n<br>\n<br>Also search splitmaster on here and look at his last build thread. He has a mm correct replica of my 62/63 interior with lots of photos. \n<br>\n<br>Your cooker cupboard is based on a 62 but is replica - look at the hinges which are replica pre-61 hinges. It has a later (67?) cooker in it too. \n<br>\n<br>The sink unit is more bay or Canterbury Pitt esque - the metal round sink as opposed to the Devon plasticy one. The tap is a 63 tap. \n<br>\n<br>The drawers look like they're based on a narrow hatch bus but with later plastic handles put in. \n<br>\n<br>And as Graham says the bulkhead unit has been done with the bottom panel the 'wrong' way up so you can't use it for the extra leg room. \n<br>\n<br>Overall a very nice looking job though, only the geeks would know!",
