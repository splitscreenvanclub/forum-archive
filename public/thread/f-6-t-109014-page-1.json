Everything works fine and trouble free but I am wondering if I will get any improvement in either performance or economy by fitting an electronic ignition module in my existing 009 dizzy. If yes is the Pertronix 2 module worth all the extra money over the Accuspark module?",

If the points carp it at the side of the road its a 5 minute job, if an electronic ignition unit carps it at the side of the road its a ball ache.

Points also do go wrong and fail; they sometimes go short circuit, not very often I accept, and they certainly wear like the clappers since 'health &amp; safety' stopped the sensible and appropriate compounds being added to the heel and the contacts to reduce the wear.\n<br>Peter Good",
