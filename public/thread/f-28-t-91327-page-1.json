    "content" : "Hi all, \n<br>\n<br>I am in the throws of restoring a 62 samba and have aspirations to race it down the 1/4 stretch at Santa Pod. the bus wont be restored for at least another 8 months yet which gives me time to start thinking about a performance engine and ancillaries. Problem is I have no clue where to start or what I am looking for? I have no idea about which places selling performance blocks are good or whether they offer sub standard machined parts. Essentially I am looking for recommendations about providers of a high performance engines and tuning specialists that might be able to make my bus MEAN! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> \n<br>\n<br>Any help or pointers would be gratefully received. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks",
