German rebuild though \n<br> \n<br> Once engine has warmed up and settled down red light comes on. Once I tickle the throttle it goes and same when driving but once revs are down on again. \n<br> \n<br> Only other thing is during my mot the tester made me rev the engine to get the headlights through the brightness test.. \n<br> \n<br> My question is is it the battery regulator or the tesco value dynamo that's at fault? \n<br> \n<br> Thanks Philip",

    "content" : "I had exactly the same problem several years ago when I replaced a Bosch dynamo with one of the cheaper repro ones. It was basically OK but from the very start, at idle the red light came on. Like yours, once the throttle was on a little bit it went out. Also tried a different regulator – no difference. The replacement dynamo only lasted a couple of years but I replaced it with a (more expensive) recon Bosch unit. This not only looked better quality (subjective, I know) but as for the original unit, the red light at idle was banished. No problems at all since then.",
