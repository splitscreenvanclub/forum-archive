She had been sprayed in that awful vauxhall purple colour that was popular in the 90's. She has had 2 restorations under my custody. If you would like to see any pictures please PM me and I would be interested in your history with her and copies of any pictures you may have.\n<br>\n<br>Regards\n<br>Simon",
