She's moving under her own power now which is great - albeit the brakes aren't working yet \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\"> \n<br>\n<br>Recently I discovered that one of my alloys has cracked - they are EMPi 5 spoke replicas (but old replicas so I don't really know who made them). They've cracked from the centre cap out to the bolt. I presume this is the common place for them to go. \n<br>\n<br>Give that they aren't original I'm reluctant to get them repaired. Does anyone have experience of alloy repairs if I did decide to go down that route. \n<br>\n<br>To be honest I think the question is what to put on to replace them? Budget means I'm looking at a new set of replicas. I'm thinking about either a straight swap for some new EMPI 5 spokes, but am tempted to change it up a little and go for Slotmags. In terms of who's wheels to go for I was thinking SSP, but not 100% sure. Any suggestions welcome.",

    "content" : "I had a horrible moment when I realised that I was going to have to make a hole in my prestine new paintwork. The Reason? The new cargo door skins were made without a hole cut for the door handle! Nobody noticed this including me until the van was painted.\n<br>Well that was all a few months ago and I've been plugging away at the rebuild and ignoring this job, as I was .... it. But today I braved it and here are the results - Not actually fitted the handle yet but you get the idea....\n<br>I'm really happy and glad I took my time. \n<br>The hole was c 14mm so I started out with small drill bit and drilled from the inside so that I could line up the fitment of the mechanism. It was scary drilling outwards through the top-coat but it held up nicely. Then I got a small round file and started working the hole, then progressed to a bigger file until finally I got the size I needed. Trial fitting the handle helped to ensure I got a good circle. \n<br>I'm so glad I didn't drill the hole in the end, as I think I may have got distortions in the door. Filing only took a few mins so definitely worth doing it the slow way!",
