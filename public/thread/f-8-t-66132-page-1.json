    "content" : "Thought it was about time i started doing something with my Split this year, well i have owned it Nearly 5 YEARS!\n<br>\n<br>I bought it of some ones forsale board at Bug jam 2005. I had always wanted a split as until then I had purely messed around with 70's bugs. \n<br>\n<br>I saw it on the Sunday, went and looked at it on the Monday and the guy delivered it from Leighton Buzzard to Wiltshire on the Wednesday or Thursday. I then put it in a small lock up garage and that's where it stayed until now. I have a habit of getting distracted by other projects so this will probably take some time!\n<br>\n<br>Will let the pictures speak for themselves.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/160510006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/160510001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I'm making some good progress now, the body repair list is gradually shrinking.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">L/H rear 1/4 bond and spot weld</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Finish cargo door skins</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FFFF00\">Cab door repairs</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Finish Wheel arch tubs</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Finish cargo floor</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Cab floor</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Lower screen surround right.</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Lower screen surround left.</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Clearance Cab floor for draglink.</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Front roof peak</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">L/H roof gutter</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">L/H rear roof corner</span> \n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">R/H rear roof corner</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Tailgate surround upper panel</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Narrow rear torsion bar 3 inches</span>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">Seam seal body. </span>\n<br>Paint!\n<br>\n<br>More very soon as this will push me along a little. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
