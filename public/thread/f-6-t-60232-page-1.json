    "content" : "Hi bus chums, After a lot of research &amp; head scratching I think my new bus will have a narrowed front beam not the red9 wishbone set up. Ive seen buses with a 4\" narrowed beam &amp; the front wheels look lost inside the wheelarch, is there a reason to go for a 4\" over a 2\" beam?, is it best to go for a creative engineering new one? or is there a better one available?, I have the old one still fitted can I shorten it myself or is it a specialized job? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n<br> Cheers Phil \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",

Always best to get a 2\" narrowed beam as these can have an extra 2\" taken from them.",

Its narrowed by 75mm but because mines a balljoint its a bit wider and the dropped ball joint spindles make it a bit wider still so I think I'm only narrowed by ~40mm but its okay with high offset porsche rims. I think it may be too narrow if it was a K&amp;L version, I certainly wouldn't want a 4\" narrow beam. If you've got low offset wheels (BRM / Empi /Radar etc) then yes 4\" is the way to go.\n<br> \n<br> Whatever beam you get just try to make sure you retain OE style roller needle bearings and grease seals.",

You can get a 4\" narrowed beam, a cheap disk conversion from C&amp;C (coz its brazilian bay with the narrow five pattern so all OE parts), drop the spindles (radish?) and then slam it to ####. You should clear the door recess inside the arch but you will rub the sloped inner roof of the arch so you'll be to chop a wee bit out and make a mini tubbed section. Those Interlagos wheels are 45mm offset and with 225 tyres they'll reach quite a long way inboard.",
