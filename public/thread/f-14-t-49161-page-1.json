The driver was obviously a big landy fan (he appears to have been a member of several 4x4 forums) and his modifications appear to have lead to a horrific accident. No one would knowingly drive their vehicle in dangerous condition would they?\n<br>\n<br>I'm having a night off from tinkering tonight but I just thought it would be good if we all stood back from our projects for a moment and thought hard about what we've been doing. This case could have severe implications for the car modification schene and the motor repair trade too.\n<br>\n<br>My thoughts are with his family. \n<br>\n<br>Keep it safe folks.",
