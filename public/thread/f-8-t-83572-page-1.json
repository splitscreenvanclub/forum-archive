She had about 84000 miles on, but I believe the majority of these were clocked up on family holidays to such exotic and far flung places as France, Italy, Spain, Austria and Germany (and remember this was 60’s Britain so that’s pretty flamboyant!) Testimony to this were all the vintage travel decals and, as I later found in the van, unsent post cards and old road maps.\n<br>JUY Was in pretty good shape and came with stacks of paperwork and receipts going back to the 70’s for things as menial as tyres.\n<br>Unfortunately I don’t have many pictures from this time, but she was all original including 6v and crossplys and was only missing the following:\n<br>\n<br>Water tank\n<br>Passenger 2/3 seat (replaced with seat from a marina!)\n<br>Awning and lower awning rail (due to sill repair)\n<br>Most of the tools from the tool roll\n<br>Cutlery and crockery \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<br>\n<br>Condition wise she was starting to need a bit of tidying having had MOT cover sills tacked on (original, but rusty sill still underneath \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cyclops.gif\" alt=\":cyclops:\" title=\"cyclops\"> ), the guttering rail had started to go as had the lower screen surrounds and the doglegs were on the way out. A tow bar had been fitted directly to the bumper and the bumper had suffered numerous dings and dents. The rear corners were going as were the bottom of the doors.\n<br>\n<br>Although I had no intention of selling in these early days, I also had no idea I would end up committing so much time and money into this vehicle... where has it all gone!",

    "content" : "It took a long time between buying JUY and being able to collect. I hadn't taken her for a test drive and she was awaiting a new MOT certificate. She needed a new silencer and it took the garage ages to locate the correct one.\n<br>Driving her for the first time was a unique mixture of fear and excitement.\n<br>It had been raining on the day and I got in and there was a pool of water on the speedo - for the first and only time I though \"Sh*t... what have I bought\"\n<br>The drive back was unique - I was constantly stirring the gear stick as I always thought I was in the wrong gear having no familiarity with the underpowered engine and driving technique of changing down way before the slightest incline in the road. Oh and of course changing down to brake - I was convinced the brakes had oil contamination \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> .\n<br>It was mainly B roads all the way back and the vagaries of the steering combined with crossplys with a directional will of their own made for great fun.\n<br>The lofty forward control seating position and a fully functioning heating system meant that by the time I got home I just wanted to keep driving. Uh-oh in about 100 miles JUY had gone from being a VW camper van to something in the blood.",

It was pretty gruelling as it was Feb or March and no heating – big thanks to Jake for the sleeping bag that you can wear while driving!\n<br>I’d had some problems with running high oil pressure prior to the trip. I didn’t have a gauge fitted but oil would leak out around the distributor pedestal.\n<br>I was working on fitting a totally overspeced breather box with venting from the rocker covers and oil filler till 2 am the morning I was leaving.\n<br>All seemed well down to Dover, but I pulled off the Autoroute for breakfast and sensed all was not well by the speckling of oil over the back of the bus. Opening the engine bay revealed oil dripping from everywhere.\n<br>So the rest of the trip down was spent driving on tenterhooks, keeping the rpms down and stopping regularly to mop down the engine bay and top up the oil.\n<br>I bedded down at a service station on the warm parcel shelf above the engine bay with engine oil in every pour – a huge motor home pulled up beside and I could see the occupants having a warm drink while watching some telly, but I still felt I had the better deal!\n<br>JUY turned the clock over on the run down although of course the speedo was running faster with the new front setup.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/7038218429/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7224/7038218429_d7151da3fc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6892124116/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/6892124116_90b8820ccb.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/7038218489/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7234/7038218489_316f53ef15.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/7038218667/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7228/7038218667_93f1c64dcf.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/7038218559/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7038218559_a389b10e77.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/7024841403/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7132/7024841403_d3f76d276e.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878740984/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7255/6878740984_50da92f1dc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878741254/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/6878741254_397c0d8f34.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878741432/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6120/6878741432_55f7e74531.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878741540/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/6878741540_b98c87f28f.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878741854/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6213/6878741854_db42b19fa9.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7636148@N06/6878740868/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6215/6878740868_a00f509de0.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

    "content" : "JUY was now back in use as a daily driver all year round. \n<br>A few more trips in the following years includding West Ireland - stunning place but the roads are a nightmare in a lowered bus. You'd be bowling along an A road at about 65mph and suddenly bottom out the steering box - makes for a very tense drive; this was not part of the plan!\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/163247.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/178647.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/178648.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Id put bigger tyres on the front before the trip but they were rubbing the arches on bumps and rounderbouts. Took my smart car tyres just in case so had them changed at a typical West Ireland tyre shop..... a shed at the back of some old boys farm.\n<br>He had some difficulty getting the bead to seat on the rim. JUY rode pretty lumpy after that. I couldn't see the extent of the problem untill we got back home and I got the wheel off; about a sixth of the tyre was completely un seated! Scary stuff and a lesson to me to never let mechanical problems wait untill its convienient - it could be a real safety issue.",
