    "content" : "Please note:\n<br>\n<br>Jeff from Stolen Splits &amp; Bays\n<br>\n<br>After careful consideration I have decided to close down my website \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.stolenvwsplitbuses.co.uk/\">www.stolenvwsplitbuses.co.uk/</a>\n<!-- w --> reason being is that I don’t really need or use it any more. As we are steadily getting more &amp; more VW enthusiasts following us on Facebook &amp; on Twitter, so I felt I didn’t need the website anymore. \n<br>\n<br>Also with us being registered with lots of different VW forums around the country, then we are definitely getting the word out with regards to Stolen VW Splits &amp; Bays.\n<br>\n<br>So absolutely no change with us on Facebook or Twitter - we can be found on Facebook under Stolen Splits &amp; on Twitter under stolen57\n<br>\n<br>Cheers Jeff",
