Support is an afterthought and to add a little excitement the drivers seat can pop off the rails if you take a corner too quick. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> I would like to fit something a little more comfortable and useable, much as I like the look of the original seats the van was bought to be used, and when I get somewhere I would still like to be able to walk.\n<br> \n<br> As stated its a LHD walkthrough, any advice/suggestions would be appreciated.",
