So I was hoping that someone might be able to talk me through (pics would be a big help!) how the table is fitted to the side of the bus?\n<br>\n<br>Table size is approx: 44\" x 24\" (1120mm x 610mm)\n<br>\n<br>Is the wood used in Pitt interiors, some form of mahogany? Any idea about the type of Formica used on the top surface of the table? Is this possible to get a close match to replace the original Formica, as it is chipped with a couple of corners missing at the moment. Ideally I was thinking of refurbishing the top of the table if a suitable Formica was available?",
