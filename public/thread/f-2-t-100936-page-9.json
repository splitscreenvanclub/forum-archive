Looking forward to Ben Pon. Hoping to have it looking very different for the show (just paint). I'm spending every night picking paint with a blade.

Attention to all the nice 51 specific details. \n<br>And then... \n<br>Restored barndoor beam and gearbox shelved and a repo adjustable barndoor beam with drop spindles bolted in. Straight axle at the back turned a few splines. Like Scotty's 52. But only bolts no cuts. NO steering box raise and centre pin steering (leads to clearance cuts). \n<br>So the whole bus can be made 100% stock within a couple of hours if it should be desired. \n<br>\n<br>Oh and number plate \n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">51amba (Slamba)</span></span> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">",

    "content" : "Here is what I known of the history of the Samba. \n<br>The guy I brought it off believed the owner before him was the original owner who ordered it from VW directly. He must of as no barndoors were imported into Greece until 1953. But there is a lot of paint jobs on this bus so perhaps he wasn't the first? That owner used it as a School bus (like all Greek barndoors \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> ) for a private school of 12-16 year olds. There is a law in Greece that no school bus can can be used for more than 12 years max to ensure road safety. So that put an end to the Sambas use for the school. They stored it for a while until the guy I got it from brought it in 1967. Which is also when the original engine got replaced. He described it to me as a perfectly complete samba painted white over red. Unfortunately he needed it to carry cargo. This meant it had to look like a panel van. This is when he cut the roof off level with the bottom edge of the sky windows to the front of the sunroof. He also cut some of the window pillars out (I'm not quite sure why?). He added the ambulance divide. He said he LOVED the original look and amazingly he stored the complete cut roof and original engine to the extent that he was surprised he couldn't find them for me!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif\" alt=\":o\" title=\"Surprised\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> The van was registered to his business, Animal food delivery, until 1974 when he sold the business. He brought the bus out of the business contract and registered it to his new company, the restaurant at the, soon to be, campsite. It lost its number plates in 1983 when he sold the restaurant. He drove it around the campsite until 1991, when a massive dog they had which kept braking his chain broke free again. When they caught up with it it was by the bus so they tied it to the van while they went out and brought a new chain. When they got back the dog had got under the van and ripped out the wiring. That's why it was left parked up. He kept it under cover into the 90s. The campsite closed in 94 and opened again in 96 as a club. This is when it turns sour. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> It was located in the club car park and drunk people returning to their cars soon started throwing stones and then it all escalated. One cluber tested out his new bull bars by driving into the front. The cans started arriving and it wasn't cared for anymore. I genuinely believe this van had but a few years left before it was junked. The vandalism was really escalating. Between my visit in April and this February someone had tried to rip the quarter light off and had used a log to smash in the split screen centre pillar. Thankfully the thorn bush had probably limited some damage and the cans had stopped any arson attempts. Someone had ripped off the engine lid and front cargo door and probably tossed them into the sea. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>The owner really loved this car though. Which is why he had never sold it. He told a story of two French guys who tried to buy the van 10 years ago with a plan to ship it to Brazil for a full resto in the Brazilian VW factory \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>He kissed and hugged it goodbye when I left and asked if possible could I return and give him a lift in it when it's done \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
