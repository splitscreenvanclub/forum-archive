    "content" : "Hi\n<br> \n<br> Hopefully video (although up-side-sown) demonstrates problem. The arm of the disengager seems to short and does not go into the housing of the blade arm.\n<br> \n<br> Is this standard .... repro part? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> Have I fitted wrong? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\">\n<br> \n<br> I have found a thread here and contacted Chad Magee in the states but not heard back. Would finding an original pair (not had much luck) help as they have teeth to grip the spindle better / arm that actually fits into the blade housing.\n<br> \n<br> I use Rain X but would like to get the wipers working properly considering the efforts/expense made to get the correct wiper motor mechanism.\n<br> \n<br> Any help or direction appreciated\n<br> \n<br> Cheers \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_compress.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":compress:\" title=\"compress\"> \n<br> R\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb288/thestrings/IMG_2418_zpsd51d3446.mp4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb288/thestrings/th_IMG_2418_zpsd51d3446.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
