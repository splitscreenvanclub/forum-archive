It also means that I can redo any dings,scratches and stone chips any time I want so I'm not too worried about actually using a pristine bus.\n<br> 2 pack is much harder and resistant to damage from both knocks and chemicals (including petrol) If I was having someone else do it I'd have 2 pack for those reasons.",
