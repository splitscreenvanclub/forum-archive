My initial thoughts were that it was going to get a new identity from a non-repairable.\n<br>\n<br>Police rang me when it was found.\n<br>\n<br>Just hope you get yours back too, i felt sick for the few days it was missing and i'm sure your feeling it at the moment.\n<br>\n<br>Good luck to you fella.",
