    "content" : "Its a 75 Fleetline that I am putting in A scooby engine into it. The Fleetline was very solid from the start so a good base for such a project. The Samba roof was a conversion kit from Columbia.\n<br>I always wanted this set up, Samba walk through but could never afford an original. Also to tear up a german made Bus and stick a scooby in it, is a bit of a shame *The engine access was a request from me in case i wanted the higher powered Turbo set up, so a RHD 15 window Fleetline was the best starting point. No one really minds if these get modded, and I wanted to see what you can do to a fleetline and how the end product could look.\n<br>I Like them as you can pick them up in such good condition for a great price, because of the lesser demand.\n<br>This Bus is not a restoration job but a customisation, so a completely different approach. Im not going to change the pressed in badge at the front as I regard this to be the DNA proof that shows just exactly what this Bus started as. I was told West Coast could if I wanted cover the fleetline up, But that is definately not what I wanted to do. Fleetline and proud !.",
