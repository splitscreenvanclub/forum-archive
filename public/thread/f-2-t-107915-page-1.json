    "content" : "Agreed. I cannot remember when I first met Peter but it was a long long time ago when he had a stall at a show. A brief examination of what he was selling and listening in to him answering questions convinced me that he was in the business for 90% interest and 10% business. He was helping a man explaining what he needed to do to investigate the faults with his starter motor....not sell him a replacement. He gave him a technical hand out showing what was what and where the faults lay. Over the years I have asked questions and received help. I ordered all Peebles's loom and aux loom and split charging items from him. I conversed on double 6v battery set ups and thankfully then ordered all my 12v electrics all over again for Sherry.\n<br>A true gentleman providing an invaluable service and help and solutions.\n<br>He will be missed\n<br>Grshsm",
