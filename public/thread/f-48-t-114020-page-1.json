    "content" : "I'm thinking of restoring my van's table...\n<br>\n<br>Sometime in its previous life my Canterbury Pitt table was cut down in length losing its rear legs in the process. Fortunately, it retained its front leg complete with spring fixing and also has the twist catch that secures the table to the side of the van so it's still very useable. A couple of short planks complete the bed space when needed and act as an additional under the table shelf when not.\n<br>\n<br>I've had a look at the Volkszone link from a previous thread – very useful thanks for that - so I know what the rear legs ought to look like though I did wonder what the width of each leg ought to be. The inside of the front leg's foot on my table has a metal bracket (shown) which I think a thin metal bolt ought to slide into. Something like this is shown in the link but I wondered if anyone might have a better, more close up photo / dimensions showing what the bolt looks like. Presumably this also stops the rear legs falling down when the table is set up for inside the van? It would also be good to know of a source for an as close as possible match to the original Formica top. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks very much.\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11551&amp;sid=5ce42ec79830fca4993b362d9f80cb0d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11551&amp;t=1&amp;sid=5ce42ec79830fca4993b362d9f80cb0d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"CP Table Foot Bracket.jpg\" title=\"CP Table Foot Bracket.jpg (54.92 KiB) Viewed 496 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",

Over the course of a month or so I managed to dis-assemble it and clean up all the original screws and brackets/hinges etc ready to put it back together again.

    "content" : "Hi Lee,\n<br>\n<br>Thanks very much for your reply. To see a few more photos would be great. I'm guessing that the width of the rear legs should be about 2¼ inches. \n<br>\n<br>My plan would be to keep the table I've got now pretty much intact just in case I end up preferring the length it currently is which just about contains the front leg when folded up. I'd just transfer over the front leg and claw catch to a new full length table top. My table also shows two lots of four holes at the front leg end where presumably short legs were previously fitted so it might be fun to add those also but I was thinking that you'd likely bash your knees into them when sitting down. No luck yet with finding a close match to the original Formica (or whatever laminate it was) so I'd probably end up using a light granite effect top surface.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks again.\n<br>Peter.",

    "content" : "Hi Lee,\n<br>\n<br>That's a great suggestion for the missing catch. Thanks very much. I hadn't come across that design before. The ones I had been looking at in local shops were rather more chunky looking so I was thinking I'd have to modify one of those or make one myself. I used the 'cranked cabinet bolt' description from your link and found the same/similar design on ebay in both cranked and straight forms so I think one of them (original shape?) would definitely be to go for if I take the plunge and make a table – potential Formica samples now sent for. I've also double checked the length of my table top and like yours the front leg actually overlaps the end a bit but not by much.\n<br>\n<br>Best wishes,\n<br>Peter",

I couldn't find a match to the original top surface but as my seat covers aren't original either I've now been looking at various different options from an ebay shop that does 4'x2' sheets. I wasn't sure from the photos how light your table top is but just in case, they offer a white pine effect, item number 252268521733 but without seeing a sample it's hard to see how close the match might be to yours.
