The trick is to arrange the interior so you can make up the bed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> You can have the cooker on either side of the van - I'm possibly going to have mine on the door side and adapt the hinge plate and rollers so it still swings out. That means I'll be making a mirror image buddy seat. Alternatively the cooker could go on the other side which means you would have the buddy seat on the door side - that would mean you would have to make a third side for the seat, but it would also mean that all cooking would be inside the van. \n<br>The catch is for holding the drop-down flap between the seats in the upright position. Do you have the flap? If you go for a full width R &amp; R bed you won't need it so you could sell the catch to me as I don't have one \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Nice pics BTW. That cooker unit on the right should have a Virr Varr top that lifts off - not hinged. AKAIK all spaceways were fitted with Argyll cookers with no legs - the cooker fits on two alloy rails riveted to the inside of the unit. So yours is interesting because it has legs. The rear clips for the warming rack are also unusual. The hinges on the large door are in fact the rare and desirable hinges for the rhs rear crockery cupboard - I have some NOS correct hinges for the cooker doors if you need any. I'll take some pics of the units I have. \n<br>\n<br>In fact we need to make this THE Spaceway thread so thanks for starting it. \n<br>\n<br>Off for a day on the ocean now - wind and rain increasing nicely and I need to service the engine \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>Brian",

Is this Vivar?? \n<br>\n<br>The black one looks identical but with a black formica top- It has the remnants of the original catch plate in the bottom exactly like this one? Could this be original? It certainly looks it..... the hinges whilst not OG seem to make sense to me- they are the kind that you can slide off to make the lid removalble still. \n<br>\n<br>I also removed the large black door with the hinges you mentioned to investigate further... \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/926265.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>.... There is no evidence of any other kind of hinge ever being attached to the hinge or the framework- these are also the same hinges used on the rear shelf storage unit. What years were the spaceway interiors made? Did they adopt the 'use what we have and make do' kind of approach??",

    "content" : "Fascinating! It looks like your cooker unit is indeed a variant of the normal one. Is there a built-in water tank? Plastic or galvanised? I have a feeling that the unit above and yours are very early versions, partly because the props on the easicool sliding seat are made of welded rod - later versions were steel tubing. The whale tap is also an early version - fitted to pre 65 bulkhead Caravettes. What on earth is this for? \n<img src=\"http://i1232.photobucket.com/albums/ff369/shaunrobinson70/66%20Split/IMG_3350.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> seems like a board that fits where the table and 'infill' part would be on the normal Spaceway. And what is the contraption fixed to the side of the cooker unit? Are you still out there Big Al and Shaun - can you join in this thread? Cool rack BTW \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>The top of your cooker is indeed Virr Varr and the table should have five leg plates - four for free standing when outside and one for the table when fixed to the wall. When the bed was made up a short leg was attached to one of the leg plates to support the table in its bed position - between the rear seat and the cooker unit. \n<br>\n<br>It may be that Devon offered some options for Spaceway interiors - I know customers would ask for the interiors team to produce furniture to their own spec. \n<br>\n<br>I'd really like the catch if you are not using it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>Brian",
