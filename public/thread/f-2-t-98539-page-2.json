Oliver ( the boss) seems to spend most of his time sourcing new busses, and not running the shop, and that leads to a slow pace of work, also he says he is doing 30 busses at once.\n<br>It seems the company is expanding rapidly and the operation is getting more professional, there is company headed invoices and a secretary. I have had 3 sets of pictures so far, well below the agreed weekly update, but that doesn't bother me, as I feel i am geting enough info. \n<br>So far so good !",

Are you paying by instalments? How are the rest pics looking? Are you having part resto and having it shipped in container or full resto and roll on, roll off shipping to Southampton by ferry?\n<br>\n<br>Would be good to hear from someone that's dealing with them.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Russ",
