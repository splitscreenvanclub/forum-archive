The depth measurement taken from the top of the hinge roll to the bottom of the frame is 455mm. (At the \"A\" post side)\n<br>I also have a friend's bus here with a set of Creative stainless steel safaris that measure 446mm.\n<br>The difference of some 9mm is a bit puzzling to say the least!\n<br>Obviously, The position of the lower frame is quite important as I don't really want to weld it on so far out of position to suit the safaris and then not be able to fit standard front screens. Any informed info would be welcome! Steve",

    "content" : "Many thanks for all replies. I'll get out there tomorrow and play some more. I'll also give CE a call as soon as I've checked out if the hinges have any braze on them and take some measurements of the glass. Was going to do it today but my mobile went out of action so had to go and buy another one.\n<br>Just to clear a few things up....they aren't double-skinned and there aren't any drain holes in them. There are depressions in the top body frame on the bus to fit the hinges to.\n<br>When I got them the glass was in them but the seals were falling apart. They also have a bit of rust here and there but still worth restoring. So I got onto CE to ask them how they come apart. They were indeed, very helpful. They were a sod to get apart but they are in bits now. \n<br>I've just assembled the frames to get some position on the lower panel before I spot-weld it to the front panel. The previous owner had just welded the front panel over the top of the top rib of the old front panel, thus reducing the window aperture, and then just applied some filler. As luck would have it, he hadn't drilled the holes for the wiper spindles! This poor old bus has had a rough time in the hands of a twit. It has taken me a long time to get all the layers of metal and filler off it to get to the point where I can fit some new proper metal.\n<br>I'll be back in a couple of days.",
