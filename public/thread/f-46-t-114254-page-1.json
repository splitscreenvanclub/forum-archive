    "content" : "I've just spending a stupid amount of time rebuilding/re-french polishing my rear cupboards, just so I can mount my Devon mirror back in its correct place above the cooker! - I know, I know I'm turning into a Devon DIC!!\n<br>\n<br>I wondered what the 4 holes in the side trim were for above the cooker, and a post on here last year put me right, its for the mirror mount - since then its been burning away at me that mine is not correct. (help! LOL)\n<br>\n<br>(my one side cupboard was a home built special and too long, so the mirror didn't fit in its correct location!, It seems my Devon only had one rear cupboard for many years - when I stripped the roof table holder, one side had a pale witness mark where the OD cupboard has been for 50 yrs, the other side had aged consistently, Anyhoo at some point a thoughtful PO had quite a good go at scratch building one in Oak, but it was made several inches too long), and as we all know length is very important ;o)\n<br>\n<br>So yesterday I put all the rebuilt cupboards &amp; table holder back in, only to go to fit the final pièce de résistance of the mirror mount and finally put the mirror trimuphantly in place - only to discover the mount I have had for yonks is a repro and the mount/trim holes don't line up anywhere near - gutted I can tell you!\n<br>\n<br>I really don't want to drill yet more holes in my side trims if I can possibly help it... Soooo....\n<br>\n<br>**WANTED** an Original Devon metal mirror mount - it has 'England' stamped on it. (the repros don't and are much narrower, although it does fit the mirror)\n<br>\n<br>ANY hens teeth out there?? \n<br>Can I prise out of someone's hoarded stash - Good English pounds paid for correct English item! LOL\n<br>\n<br>Here are some pics of my OD door mount - it has England stamped on it, and has radiused inner edges - another needed please!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsfd26cceb.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsfd26cceb.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Here are the 'offending' trim holes, you can see the cupboard is too long, and the mirror has no room (by about an inch!)\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsf903e310.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
