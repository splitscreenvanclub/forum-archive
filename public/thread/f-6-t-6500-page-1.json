Our terms of payment are cash or via Visa/Mastercard – card number and expiry date. \n<br> \n<br> Our bank account \n<br> Volksbank Wolfsburg\n<br> BLZ 269 910 66\n<br> Konto 811 840 000\n<br> \n<br> or you send the credit card number via fax, our fax number is (0)53 61 – 5 20 10.\n<br> \n<br> We need to know the chassis number of your vehicle, the name of the vehicles‘ owner and the complete address where we should send the certificate to.\n<br> \n<br> We are looking forward to hearing from you.\n<br> \n<br> Yours faithfully,\n<br> \n<br> Christine Neefe\n<br> AutoMuseum Wolfsburg\n<br> \n<br> For the research we need 4 – 5 weeks\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps a little. DVLA also asked to see my van and then issued me with a tax disc at the same time as registration. I think there may be certain DVLA offices you need to go to so have a look on their website if necessary.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",

It looks like the site has been revamped/updated so it's probably best just to click on the Kontact option at the bottom of the screen and send them an email. I'm sure they will realise it is all in English and that they will therefore respond in English. It seems odd that if you follow the link to the VW AG site there is still a little union jack to click on but there isn't on this site. Maybe they are just fed up with issuing these certificates so have tried to make it as hard as possible to get one!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br> \n<br> steve \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
