    "content" : "Ok , after a good nights sleep, time to update, as a lot of you know the Ghia sustained a dent in the top of the rear wing last year when Hetty the vacuum toppled down on top of it , while in our garage &amp; at most shows &amp; wedding fairs I just strategically placed a picnic blanket over it. A few weeks ago we did a wedding fair &amp; a local Doctor booked Mr Bo (The Split) Mrs Bo (The Caravelle) &amp; wanted something to take the brides mother to the church, so like a plonker I mentioned the Ghia, which he booked. \n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> So with about 3 weeks till the wedding I decided to strip it right down, as I thought rather than just knock out the dent, I'd paint the whole car at the same time \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> I also remembered I had a set of CB dropped spindles that had come with the Oval &amp; hadn't used them , so I thought I'd have a go at fitting them as well.\n<br>So after an issue with the paint &amp; silocones, the Ghia was ready to move on Thursday morning, so up early to start polish the lower half of Mr Bo, then down the unit to fit the rear lights &amp; number plate to the Ghia &amp; drop back onto the wheels \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> but with it lower &amp; the stock tyres it wouldn't turn much off centre, so belted home to pick up the new BBT Spintstars, 4.5\" with 145/65 15's on the front &amp; 5.5\" with 165/65/15@ on the back......\n<br>It drove really nicely , although totally different feel to before. I spent the rest of the day getting seriously frustrated, when almost everything I tried to fit, gave me issues, so after a long 15 hour day I stopped ...........door handles &amp; door trim beating me big time. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>Then Friday back out at 7am again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> &amp; started the day polishing the roof rack on Mr. Bo. &amp; the bright work which took about 4 hours, popped into town to sort a couple of bits including matching ties for Gary &amp; me &amp; some different adhesives to try to help with the trim. An hour later back home &amp; onto the Ghia again, now with Trina &amp; Jaz lending a hand, washing the Caravelle, polishing the windows on all 3, polishing the Caravelle, cleaning the hood inside &amp; out on the Ghia, cleaning &amp; refitting the carpets, seats, door panels, bumpers, door handles ....................&amp; loads more, finally knocking off around half nine \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> The last couple of jobs we did was put the ribbons on the Ghia &amp; try another adhesive on the trim after the clips &amp; first adhesive didn't work.\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> 6.45am Saturday morning S*#t how am I going to get to the fuel tank on the Ghia with the ribbons there, still down the garage &amp; we had just about enough movement to do it, but the trim still wasn't working, I tried 3 shops but at noone had what I was after, so had to catch Jonse on his paper round &amp; ask him to try when the rest of the shops opened at 9 to get some 2\" wide clear tape. Then phone Gary &amp; shouted for help, we took the trim off again, cleaned off everything &amp; carefully laid the tape the full length of the trim &amp; prayed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Trina dropped the kids off to the baby sitter, Gary went off to get changed, I kept on polishing &amp; with Trina back got all the ribbons on Mr &amp; Mrs Bo Jangles. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>Gary came back at 11 all suited &amp; booted I was still polishing, Trina found the Champagne for the happy couple , Gary wrote the card &amp; I got changed.\n<br>11.30 time to leave, all the motors looked sweet, I had to fill Mr Bo up with juice &amp; caught the other two up, we got to the Brides family home at 12 noon on the dot as arranged, the sun was shining &amp; all looked good \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>&amp; to introduce the team\n<br>Me with Mr Bo Jangles\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Trina with Mr Bo Jangles\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11017.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>&amp; Gary with Karmann Bo Jangles\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The bride &amp; bridesmaids came out &amp; all was going well, everyone loved the motors, \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11013.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>but all the time both Gary &amp; I could smell petrol \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> \n<br>We just weren't sure &amp; couldn't work out from where\n<br>Gary set off for the church with the brides mother, \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11015.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>All the bridesmaids got in to the Caravelle &amp; the bride got into Mr Bo\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/crewcab/laurasimonapr11020.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> Then a realised a massive pool of fuel under the rear wheel, I checked the engine bay but all was fine then I saw it pouring out of the filler neck. I had to calmly ask the bride to just step out of the van without adding to her nerves that her big day was giving her anyway, the brides father was totally understanding, being a bit of a petrol head himself he understood what was happening, as I'd filled up on the way there &amp; in the heat the fuel expanded &amp; had nowhere to go, so after removing the cap to release the pressure, a wod of loo roll &amp; one large polishing rag &amp; we had it sorted ..........
