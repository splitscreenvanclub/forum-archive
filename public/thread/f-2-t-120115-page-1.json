    "content" : "Hi All,\n<br> \n<br> I imported a South African Van from Ireland in March, Its a 1967 Splitscreen. Im hoping to get it booked in for an MOT over the next couple of weeks and get it registered for the UK roads. Unfortunately the M plate and Vin numbe has been removed. South African vw issued a separate VIN number but I'm wondering if theres a way in order to prove the age of the split screen? All i have is the first registered date not the manufactured date?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advanced.\n<br> \n<br> Jac Evans.",

    "content" : "I'm struggling to understand about the VINs. You've said that VW South Africa issued a 'separate VIN', but the SA registration document only states the VIN that you've been told was the original VIN. The Irish DoT document lists a modern alphanumeric VIN. Is that the 'separate VIN' that you said VW SA issued, or did the Irish DoT issue it with a modern VIN?\n<br> \n<br> Is that modern VIN number stamped anywhere anywhere on the vehicle? I've seen pictures on The Samba of Dutch (I think) Beetles that were stamped with new numbers by their DoT when they gave them modern registrations (I guess they had a law-change at some point). Their numbers were stamped as a series of dots, like a dot-matrix printer.\n<br> \n<br> Without a stamped-on VIN that can be authenticated by the country which stamped it, it'll be hard to prove that it's the same vehicle on either of the documents, let alone the year of manufacture. Have you spoken with the DVLA yet? Are they telling you it'll need to go on a 'Q' plate?\n<br> \n<br> I can understand if the DVLA are suspicious. There is nothing other than the date on those two documents that relates them to each other (and without a stamped VIN, nothing to relate them to the vehicle other than your word and the word of the seller). Even the engine number is different.\n<br> \n<br> By way of aging, you could always post some pictures, they would at least show whether it has the right features for a '67, not earlier or later (post-67 Brazilian export to South Africa). I'd try posting the pictures on the Samba too. There are guys on there that know the correct features for each year inside and out.\n<br> \n<br> But even if you got confirmation that it's visually correct for a '67, without the VIN and matching documents, you'll still struggle to prove it. There are post-67 Brazilian splits modified to look like earlier ones. It's just metal. It can be cut and welded.",
