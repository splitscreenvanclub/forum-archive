    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>Just bought some rear bumper trims for my US spec bumpers.\n<br>\n<br>They are repro ones and a long way off fitting my bumper.\n<br>\n<br>No reflection on the guy I bought them off as it's not his fault ( I am trying to find out who the manufacturer was).\n<br>\n<br>If I hold the 'front' end up to the bumper, the curve round the bumper is ok, but instead of the trim continuing to curve inwards to match the bumper profile, the last 4 inches or so actually curve out, as it approaches the over-rider - hope this makes sense - will have to get some photo's up to show you what I mean.\n<br>\n<br>I realise that most repro stuff is total crap, but whoever made them appears to have been guessing at the bumper profile.\n<br>\n<br>Just wondered if anyone had the same issues &amp; whether they had managed to curve the trim inwards sufficiently to get it to fit (I assume heat will be needed).\n<br>\n<br>Thanks.",

    "content" : "Ernie, are you talking about deluxe bumper trims? If so, no, they never fit and you do need to gently bend them to the exact curve of the bumper. I had to gentle bend mine to get the fit right, no need for heat as they are Ali and soft, but they did come good in the end.\n<br>\n<br>If you don't mean these, please let me know, the only other thing I can think you mean are the towel rails? I also had issues with getting mine to fit nicely as well.",
