How was it in comparison to an MOT? \n<br>\n<br>I am having a nightmare trying to register my Riviera as it was never originally sold here in Italy so they only see a commercial van with windows chopped in it. Add to that the fact it’s modified! The standard practice here is to do a TÜV SÜD which they also do in Italian language providing a full data sheet on any vehicle presented to them. \n<br>\n<br>Before I drop the 1120 Euros on this I wanted to see if anyone has any knowledge/experience of TÜV. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Phil",
