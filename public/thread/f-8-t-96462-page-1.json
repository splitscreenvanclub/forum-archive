Will have another in the next couple of weeks as we're off to Wales in the old girl next.\n<br> \n<br> Hey all,\n<br> \n<br> Well as some of you know I have just completed my first trip across the Channel in the bus so I thought I'd share my experience with you.\n<br> \n<br> Destination: Benodet France, 2 people, 2 dogs and one fully loaded bus!\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s455.photobucket.com/user/mclarni/media/France%202013/francetrip_zps33736b55.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/France%202013/francetrip_zps33736b55.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Our trip started at home in Angmering, West Sussex. Bus all loaded we set off at 6am to travel to Portsmouth to catch the 9am high speed ferry to Cherbourg.\n<br> \n<br> Quick stop at a park in Portsmouth to allow the dogs to have a good run before we headed off to the Ferry port.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s455.photobucket.com/user/mclarni/media/France%202013/2013-07-03065840_zps7d28bb30.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/France%202013/2013-07-03065840_zps7d28bb30.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> At the ferry port waiting to board\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s455.photobucket.com/user/mclarni/media/France%202013/2013-07-03073206_zps24c4251f.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/France%202013/2013-07-03073206_zps24c4251f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s455.photobucket.com/user/mclarni/media/France%202013/2013-07-03075219_zpsf6ecea77.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/France%202013/2013-07-03075219_zpsf6ecea77.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> The Ferry takes 3.5 hours and is a high speed catamaran. We were travelling with a couple of friends who took their 11 month old daughter in their Nissan Qashqi.\n<br> \n<br> So my bus is low and I haven't had the steering box raised yet. We go to board the ferry and BANG! The bus stops dead on the first ramp. Steering box well and truly walloped! A slight adjustment to angle and speed and we're on with a slightly concerned look from the captain! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br> \n<br> The ferry crossing was ROUGH! People being sick, passing out. Sea sky sea sky sea sky etc etc. The ferry company had to get ambulances to meet people at the other side it was that bad. Not normally that bad we were told. Lucky Kate and I have sea legs and were unaffected by the crossing. Our two friends and their baby however did feel rough so we assisted with the baby during the crossing.\n<br> \n<br> We get to the other side, check on the dogs who seem to be unaffected of the whole crossing ordeal get off the ferry with no issues and stop briefly in Cherbourg to allow them to have a bit of a run before the next part of the journey.\n<br> \n<br> So we start our journey from Cherbourg and head South for the 460km journey to Benodet. (no pics I'm afraid as I was driving)\n<br> \n<br> The roads in France are fantastic and smooth. We didn't ground out on any of the roads between Cherbourg and Benodet However their are a lot of seriously long steep hills! With the bus fully loaded and the 1600cc struggling we were slowing to 35mph in 3rd gear on the longer hills.\n<br> \n<br> I drove for a few hours then let Kate take the helm for a while from Rennes Whilst the dogs and I kicked back and relaxed. JZ-77 had made us a storage box for the dogs to sit on between the front seats and it worked brilliant!

Great display of Dubs and loads of jumbly goodies. Seriously didn't take enough cash. Some awesome vans there \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> but Rome wasn't built in a day I guess. \n<br> \n<br> Despite being in a telecommunications time warp/black spot all weekend we managed to get a weather forecast for Monday and decided to bring in the awning that night - rather expertly actually - hope our neighbour was watching! Despite looking a little bit tiny on our pitch we had absolute delight this morning while taking breakfast watching campers packing up in torrential rain \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> whilst surreptitiously placing towels under our major leaks and pretending they weren't there. \n<br> \n<br> The weather broke so we made a break for our 3 1/2 hour journey home knowing the works traffic should have cleared for the delightful M6 and M62 wranglings. \n<br> \n<br> After a couple of hours we were due to refuel M62 or push to Weatherby? Nah girl likes a wriggle and a walk so Hartshead Moor it was. \n<br> We found an exclusive part of the car park as always:\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=1340&amp;sid=de06b3bf0a1a8ecf282f0c9c51f2834f\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   image.jpg (61.21 KiB) Viewed 1241 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> Oh .... that's our oil all over. Tarp out get on the floor Carl, check the dipstick. \n<br> We may have been Very lucky today!! Tiny tiny split in one of the oil lines!\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=1342&amp;sid=de06b3bf0a1a8ecf282f0c9c51f2834f\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   image.jpg (59.63 KiB) Viewed 1241 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> The AA man was a but mardy at first but he thawed a bit and got on with fitting us a temp hose. A potential disaster but in the end cost me £11 to replace the litre of oil we'd dropped and a few quid for some choglud for the AA man \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br> \n<br> Not sure how much the residual repairs of full set of Pirtek hoses will cost but better safe than sorry. \n<br> \n<br> Feel a bit more seasoned now we've had a breakdown issue but infinitely lucky it wasn't worse. \n<br> \n<br> Incidentally the fire suppression system enjoyed its ride out too but is being replaced tomorrow after the manufacturer agreed it was faulty. \n<br> \n<br> PS sorry its in instalments. Technological ghosts have followed us home! \n<br> Good old Mabel glad to get home under our own steam. X x",
