Its currently running a single circuit set up....I purchased a reservoir seperately(iys a volvo one) the centres of the holes in it are 85mm apart will this dual circuit master cylinder work??? \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.coolairvw.co.uk/Item/Shop_by_Vehicle~Baywindow_Bus_Products~Bay_Bus_Brake_Products~Bay_Bus_Master_Cylinders/211611021AA/T2_71-79_With_Servo_Brakes_Master_Cylinder_Lhd_-OB-85mm_Pipe_ID-CB-.html\">http://www.coolairvw.co.uk/Item/Shop_by ...
