    "content" : "Notice the other day my leisure battery had gone flat so decided to fault find. Well the fuse(25 amp) that runs from the alternator to terminal 30 on the relay had been burned to half it's size with the fuse wire intact so assume it only broke circuit due to not making contact. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> I tried to see if the relay was working but there seemed to be no or little charge coming out of the relay. I am led to believe if a battery gets very flat that this could cause over 200volts to go back down the cable to the said fuse(weekest point/ alternator.\n<br> \n<br> This is something i found on the subject and was repeated again on other websites \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br> \n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n  Well, in the relays coil something similar happens, only not on such a grand scale, when the coils magnetic field collapses, it too creates a high voltage, but as there's only one coil, it creates in the coil you were powering from the alternator, this causes an inductive kickback (also known as Back EMF) basically anything upto 200 volts can be sent back down the wire that was powering the relays coil.. and this is connected to the alternator, where it could be possible to cause some damage.\n  <br> \n  <br> There is a way to prevent this inductive kickback from getting any further than the coil, and that's to use a diode across the coil like below.\n </div>\n</blockquote>Any easy and safe ways to resolve this the wire is about 27 amp feeding the relay and the relay is 40 amp not into fitting diodes so what have you guys done or is it only my badluck. It was a close call in the engine bay \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\">",

I'm gonna have to rethink this if i'm going for full on I.C.E with base bins etc.",

    "content" : "Just a few of my thoughts prompted by this thread.\n<br> When installing a fridge or cool box, do not use the leisure battery circuit, connect via a separate relay directly to the generator.\n<br> Do not drive more than one relay from the D+ circuit of an alternator. (Not applicable to dynamos!) If two or more relays (e.g. fridge and leisure battery) are required, use another relay switched by the D+ circuit alone and use it to drive all the others.\n<br> If you have any form of electronics on board the vehicle, always ensure a capacitor (= condenser = suppressor) value 2.2uF is across the alternator or dynamo regulator B+ terminal to earth, as a minimum. Relays are not the only vehicle component that that produces fast high voltage spikes! (fortunately with low energy)\n<br> If you have really expensive electronic equipment on board, then a wise investment is in relays with integral diode, or alternatively fit a diode externally.\n<br> For battery isolators, a âmachined sensedâ version is applicable for the air-cooled range.\n<br> Should any battery ever become fully (or nearly) discharged, re-charge with a battery charger â except in an emergency of course!\n<br> Peter Good",
