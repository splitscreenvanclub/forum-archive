    "content" : "Been rubbing the busses roof down today, the bus will never be a pretty bus as it has to many dents.\n<br> What I wanted to know was how much paint to take off before it's ready to be primered.\n<br> I was lucky in that there wasn't any holes anywhere only a few scabs that when cleaned off just left pitted metal, I was unlucky as it has so many coats of paint.\n<br> The pictures show the pinky colour [slight dents/depressions], a blue colour and the original army green, there are also coats of primer between each of these.\n<br> The van was rubbed down by hand with wet and dry on a block, the dents are only very slight and with the matt paint not that noticable. I think with a shiny paint, they'll be a lot more obvious, I asked about paint at a paint shop and was told to stick with gloss paint although I thought satin would look better.\n<br> 1. I've treated the scabby area's with Kurust [hammerite], should these be filled to bring to paint level or the surrounding paint taken down to their level?\n<br> 2. Do you primer the bare metal then fill or fill first?\n<br> 3. What do people think of Hammerite rust proof primer, I have used this before and it does seem to hold the rust back longer.\n<br> 4. If using the above primer, it's a brush on and will need more rubbing down, is this a good idea?\n<br> 5. I intend to spray the bus back to army green, the bus has a few ripples/dents, not really bad but will show. I didn't want to try and fill the lot as afraid of it cracking, do you think satin or gloss paint?\n<br> 6. Does buying a marquee thing sound like a good idea to spray a bus in, I have a big concrete drive but not enough room in the garage to enable spraying?\n<br> 7. How much more paint should be removed from roof?\n<br> \n<br> I'm on a real budget here so any idea's welcome especially if it saves a few pounds \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y213/brianjbox/Picture002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y213/brianjbox/Picture001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> One more thing please, are sunroofs easy to remove or can I expect problems there.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers guys.",

    "content" : "My experiences with spraying are that preperation is the most important part of the job. How much time you spend is all down to personal choice but if you can get all the paint off - back to bear metal, you stand a better chance of a better paint job.\n<br> When using filler this should be applied to clean metal- not paint, I used Upol easy sanding filler- worked well.\n<br> If you brush on primer it will need to be rubbed down\n<br> Using a tent is a good option choose a still warm day to paint. \n<br> Use 2 pack paint if you can - (beware of health and safety implications) you can get a good finish from the gun with very little hand finishing and take your time.\n<br> Practice on something else first - neighbours car. old panels, thinners tins.\n<br> Try and buy all of your paint in one tin to be sure of getting exactly the same clour all over.\n<br> Check out \"for sale- better than a split\" my morris commercial that I painted at home! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
