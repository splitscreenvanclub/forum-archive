DVLA have issued a 63 plate and V5 and say this is correct as was first registered in 63, this knocks ££ off the price of my vehicle.\n<br>\n<br>My understanding was that if we provide the necessary documentation proving year of manufacture then this is reordered ????? , has anyone else come across this?? is there a way around it??\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance",

I have sent them back and all good!!\n<br>Call them and point out you dilemma.\n<br>\n<br>Regards Gary",
