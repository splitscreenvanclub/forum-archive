    "content" : "Just received my ladder from 'Turbo Thomas' as was originally posted by 'Jenni' on here.\n<br> \n<br> Very happy with it - well made, solid and looks good on the bus. Just waiting to powder coat it black and then it'll be fitted for use.\n<br> \n<br> I've included a couple of photos in case anyone is interested as I believe that he still has a few mild and stainless steel ones for sale. The mild steel cost me £140.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd117/plymouthpaul/ladder1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd117/plymouthpaul/ladder2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Thanks to Jenni for arranging the purchase. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
