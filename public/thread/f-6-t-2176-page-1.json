I saw it at the SSVC Ace Cafe swap meet do and was impressed by the design because it offers plenty of protection and doesn't get in the way. He said he was going to put some details up on his web site...I think it would cost £300-400 to have fitted..",

Mine only came with lap belts in the front but again I've dug in to my pockets to ensure safety. \n<br> \n<br>Just sit back and count how much money you have spent on your van such as the wheels, engine, interior etc. If like me it will be a great deal. \n<br> \n<br>I consider safety of my family &amp; me more than the wheels i run.",
