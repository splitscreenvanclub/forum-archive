    "content" : "<span style=\"color: #0000FF\">Looking to buy this 1962 VW Crew cab. It runs like a dream and the horn and all electrics work. Brakes are good and it runs as good as any bus I've been in. It does however have some rust. The sills and the front of the bed have rust. Floor pans need doing and the bottom of the nose is bubbling. Battery tray also. It's always been in California and the current owner has had it 30 years! What do you think it's worth in the good old UK? It comes with the complete back seat and all the windows. Gates have a bit of rust at the bottom.</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/p/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5212Large-vi.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5212Large-vi.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/p/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5210Medium-vi.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5210Medium-vi.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/p/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5209Medium-vi.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5209Medium-vi.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/p/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5214Medium-vi.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5214Medium-vi.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/p/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5224Medium-vi.jpg\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/74_100/106_129/IMG_5224Medium-vi.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

Well I hope I'm right anyway, I bought a SA RHD DC last year for a little over 17k (neg down from 18.5k!). 1776, airbags, brms, restored a few years back. They are rare, well especially the RHD ones. DCs are cool mate, go for it. 5-6k sounds good to me, when I was looking a couldn't find anything that was full of holes for less the 10-12k.",
