    "content" : "I am yet another Pitt owner, but not a normal one! Not sure if that refers to me or the van, but as they say 'if the hat fits!'. \n<br>I was looking for a split camper a while back and saw an advert locally for a project. Turned out to be a '65 kombi with a Pitt interior, but in hindsight I don't think the two had ever met. I bought the lot thinking I could whip up a camper in a few weeks (who hasn't been there?). Then, as often happens things change. Life changes, career changes, you name it. No chance of working on the van in the evenings, or even at weekends.\n<br>So a decision was made - keep the interior and change the van!\n<br>Quick call to my old contact Owen to see what he had, and a prospect looked hopeful. Visit to his emporium, no haggling, and I had a Swedish ex-school bus, without engine. He would even take the old project van away. Deal, or what? He delivered the new buy, and took away the old one. Can't recommend him high enough.\n<br>Then the story began. Creative this, that and the other (IRS, Safaris, beam adjusters to name a few). \n<br>Owen recommended a mate of his to do the above work for me so the van went off to them.\n<br>As luck would have it, they had a new 2.1 engine laying around for a few quid (!), so that went in. Mechanics were sorted and a brake servo fitted. I had got a Beetle box from our local scrap yard for the IRS, and Rob Graham came across the cross over shafts, hubs etc to make it all work.\n<br>I even managed to get the van featured in Volksworld a couple of times under their technical 'how to' sections.\n<br>So, van returned home as a mechanically perfect empty VW. All I had to do was fit the Pitt interior.\n<br>9 years later and it's nearly done!\n<br>Divorce, re-marriage, work in Aberdeen, Canada, Monaco, Italy and a few other things have taken up some of that time.\n<br>However, the van is now together, with new cushions and 99% ready. Just a couple of wiring jobs to do. \n<br>I made life a bit difficult for myself (!) by choosing a double double door, so no long side for the bed or the table. Still not sure how to get over that one. Good thing is that I get an awning / tent both sides.\n<br>So, my main questions after all this - how do I post pictures? Can I be an honorary member of the Pitt owners club even though I only have the inside?\n<br>As a complete aside, I do own a Canterbury sidecar, attached to a BSA motorcycle. I believe this was built by the company who combined with Pitt to become Canterbury Pitt conversions.",
