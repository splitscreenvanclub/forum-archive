In a bay window bus (on the dashboard) there is a similar system to that of the Beetle, just levers, and not a knob to be turned. I would imagine this would be a better system, and prevent the heater wire from being twisted. \n<br> \n<br> So: Has anyone here done, or seen, a redesign of the heating adjustment? A link or a description would be really appreciated.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers from Norway\n<br> Svein",

Perhaps cleaning up this area in case its all galled up will help. Plenty of anti sieze on the shuttle. \n<br> \n<br> As for the cable/wire/rod - make sure you can move the cables easily. When inserting the cables left and right should be observed and then you must not kink. Often overlooked - the return springs on the heater boxes should keep the cable tensioned - it is not the job of the shuttle to push the cables back in. Hence smooth cables will help the system work as designed.\n<br> \n<br> A clean shuttle without galling or damaged dowel slot;\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.busandcamper.com/shop/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/e/heater_knob_cable_adjuster_1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

    "content" : "My bus did'nt come with a working heater... Found out that the cables were broken (along with missing heat exchanger levers etc) . I bought new hardware, cleaned up the shuttle/slide assy in the cab, took me a few mins to suss out how it worked... But its simple one once you picture it in your mind. I fitted new a new cable and found out the hard way that one side of the cable is v slightly longer than the other... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> Worth mentioning, after I could'nt connect the heat exhanger lever one one side! It also took me several (lots!) attempts to get the cables in the tubes correctly... I'd get them in almost all the way in, until the last 6inches to go, then 'twang' and they'd twist up solid... It took me more than a few attempts to feed them in straight, while keeping them greased , and annoyingly they would twang and cross over tight, right at the end... Eventually I mananged to get the cables in the tubes, and sort of 'spin' the cables in the tubes enough to get the twist out of them, to get it to go in straight and untwisted for the last few inches, i think this is the problem with breaking cables, you have to get the wires down the tubes with no twisting tension stored in the cables, it was harder than I thought.... Works great now though \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> it doesn't help that new cables (actually wires) come coiled up in a circle, already storing twist &amp; tension!\n<br> \n<br> It's another one of those bus 5min jobs that takes over an hour \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_colors.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":colors:\" title=\"colors\">",
