She was built by Larry Stockford at Retro Customs who has done an amazing job and the 6 year wait he has for resto/builds is testament to the quality of his work.\n<br>\n<br>She is a truly stunning piece of art and it would cost you more in time and money than I am asking for her to build such a bus. The asking price is Â£35,000\n<br>\n<br>This is a link to the article on her that was in the Sept magazine.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.volksworld.com/wallpaper/1971-bay-window-westfalia-28447\">http://www.volksworld.com/wallpaper/197 ... alia-28447</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>If you would like any other pictures or information please contact me\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:philipjubb@ntlworld.com\">philipjubb@ntlworld.com</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>07972634470",
