I can only seem to find pictures of walkthrough Spaceways.\n<br>\n<br>I'm aiming to see how the seat works against the bulkhead. Did these come with the swing out cooker or was it door mounted? how big was the seat that went up against the bulkhead?\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks\n<br>Lee.",

    "content" : "Wow thank you folks, there it is... I actually have a 67 'Torvette Standard'. I've had this van since 1994 and I never knew that! It certainly never clicked that a spaceway was a walkthrough. I guess the name makes sense now.\n<br>\n<br>In all honesty my van is presently a Canterbury Pitt as that is the interior I fitted in 1999 - after I threw the old Torvette interior into a skip! It was terribly badly painted and butchered, but if I knew then what I knew now I would have kept it.\n<br>\n<br>Anywho, I soon regretted throwing away the old interior and converting my van to the wrong breed. Soooo over the intervening years I have collected the correct interior back together again. I actually have two almost complete Torvette interiors waiting in the wings (including a mint easicool and full width slider cabinet). I still can't quite see how the front bulkhead seat works as I think the seats I have, with both of my interiors, are Torvette Spaceway seats.\n<br>\n<br>Is there anyone else out there with a Torvette Standard? If so could I perv a pic of the bulkhead seat?\n<br>\n<br>The cool brochures link has also shown me that the old fold up cooker, I once had, would have fitted above the easicool. I've never seen another again, but I do have the older cooker for the door mounted box. Not perfect but probably more practical. Just need to source a cooker box!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks to everyone who has helped above, I'm genuinly enlightened!",
