    "content" : "Thanks - didn't mean to suggest that the coilovers are fighting AGAINST the torsion leaves, but surely the coilovers will be working WITH the torsion leaves, adding further suspension, so surely making the ride harder?\n<br>\n<br>So, imagine going over a raised bump - with just torsion leaves, the weight of the bus will be pushing down on the front of the bus, trying to twist the torsion leaves, hence the OEM suspension effect - with coilovers as well, surely the weight of the bus will still be doing the same thing to the torsion leaves, but also trying to compress the coil as well, hence two forces acting against the weight of the bus, the upward force exerted by the coil &amp; also the twisting force exerted by the torsion leaves?\n<br>\n<br>Feels like I am getting a bit carried away here with Newton's Laws of Motion!
