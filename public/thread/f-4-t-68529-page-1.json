    "content" : "Greetings all wet kneed split owners,\n<br>\n<br>For sale is, what we think to be, the best Safari Seal on the market in terms of quality and price. We have tested these on a total 5 splits and haven't had a leak, even with the full on down pours this weekend. Like any other Safari Seal on the market I can't guarantee that they won't leak as I'm sure you know Safari Windows weren't designed for UK and with past work carried out on vans frames can mean they aren't as true as they used to be. What I can say is the fit is perfect, the gripper edge has inner lips to prevent water passing through and it's size prevents buckling around the corner, one of the main areas of leaking we have found. We have now tried 7 different seals and our choice, we think, is the the most leak proof on the market, yet still compresses enough to allow the window to seat properly. Do you have to fit sealant?... I believe not as the fins would have to be practically submerged to allow water pass. I'm sure there is the exception but we have found it not to be necessary. What I'd recommend is fit them and if you feel it would help add a little. Even our 'not so concourse' (No offense- Phil \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">) test bus did not require any. Images of seals fitted the buses to follow shortly. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> . \n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\">******EDIT - Now sold 70+ seals with great feedback and no returns.******</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/Monkeydub/Safari_Front_Open.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/Monkeydub/Safari_Bot_Corner.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/Monkeydub/Safari_Front.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/Monkeydub/Safari_Inside_Bot.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v652/Monkeydub/Safari_Top.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Price: £34 UK posted\n<br>\n<br>Edit: Adding pics and clarifying info \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

I'm not one to rest on my laurels, so wanted to see if I could find the all elusive leak free seal. I have not experienced butty's seals.\n<br>So quality wise I can't speak for butty, but I know how high quality mine are and I'm a few quid cheaper. I'm not here to ruffle feathers, I love vw's and working with them brings me joy, if at the same time I find something that works well that others can benefit from, and I can keep my split on the road all the better. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
