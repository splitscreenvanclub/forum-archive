I still have mine to do and even a good friend who is an architectural metalwork designer is scratching his head to bend the WW stuff neatly.

    "content" : "It was a complete ******* to be honest. If you can find something similar in Ali, use it. The WW is too stiff and not fit for this purpose really.\n<br>\n<br>Essentially MarkP and I worked out where the curve would be, Then snipped the flat section to allow it to bend easier. Then we inserted a small length of wire into the section where the bend would be to stop the section closing up. Then bent the section, then panel beated the flat bit to stop them sticking out everywhere. The only issue is that the wire is trapped, so around that corner, the rubber doesn't sit under the lip. Its not ideal but it was the only way we could get it to bend and look right.\n<br>\n<br>The drivers side is a better fit than the passengers, which didn't bend as nice as the drivers side. They're not perfect by any means, but they're good enough for me not to worry too much about them. Most of it will be obscured by furniture anyway, so I don't think the flaws will show up too much.",
