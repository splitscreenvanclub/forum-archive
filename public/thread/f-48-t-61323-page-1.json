Any pics or details would be great,\n<br>\n<br>Graham",

    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>\n<br>Yes your canopy was obviously for the non pop top version. The long straps went to each corner as you say and then were held in place by a small L shaped pin then went through a drilled hole in the corners of the rain gutters. \n<br>\n<br>One version I saw had a threaded pin with small nuts either side to keep them in place. To be honest from the original picture I have, you cannot tell the detail of this pin.\n<br>\n<br>I have a non pop top too but have had another canopy made with similar thin stripe material but in green (from Dormobile). As the bus did not have a Pitt interior and I loathed to drill holes in the gutters, I decided to make it fit to the gutter above the doors as some other after market canopies on the market.\n<br>\n<br>Choice is yours!\n<br>\n<br>O.",
