    "content" : "After driving around France, Spain and Portugal in the summer of 2005 clocking up 5,000 miles over 3 months, we decided old Dottie needed a bit of a winter makeover. The bottom six inches where starting to bubble and rott due to the 40 degree heat of sunny Spain and filler started to apear all over the place . Anyway she made it back to sunny Yorkshire without a single splutter. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>It was time to get stuck into the ord lass and bring her back to her former glory!\n<br>Me and my brother Carl ripped out the interior which was glued in more or less as one whole unit, what a nightmare to get out. After a full day of carefully removing the interior bit by bit we finally managed to get it out without to much damage.\n<br> We then started work on getting the front and side cargo doors off.\n<br>After a few clouts with the hammer and some fluent French from me Dad, the doors where off and the new ones where on. Dottie was now ready for the 12mile trip to Super Norms at Driffield. \n<br>Here are some pics.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00328.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00331.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00345.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">I think this corners about had it!</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00350.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">'Flying without wings'</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00385.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00412.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Heres Dad ready for the trip to Norms, with only a couple of windows left in the Bus, good job its sunny Yorkshire!!</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00408.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Norm wastes no time hes on to it like a rat up a drain pipe!</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00425.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00424.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Off with her head!!!</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00423.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00422.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Will keep you updated with the next installment off Dotties winter makeover.........</span>\n<br>Up dated 16.01.06\n<br>The whole of the bottom 6 inches of this side was rotten including B-post\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00427.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00429.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The whole of the back end has been replaced including both battery trays\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00428.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/DSC00430.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Most of the welding done now.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/RodStewartGreatest003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/RodStewartGreatest004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Starting to take shape now.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/RodStewartGreatest006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Front arch on.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f240/tractortom/RodStewartGreatest030.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Hopefully all the body work and the paint job will be finished for early March, then its time to put the old lass back together!\n<br>\n<br>Here are some more pics from Norms Workshop.
