Erna has requested a large, shaggy66bus is to get back to me but if I don't hear will get a large, and then the large and small are going to Dom. I think I can squeeze that lot into my case so I will have to leave it at that and sort out further requests when I come back or with Carlos who is coming out later in the year.\n<br>\n<br>Sorry to let some of you down, I am just running out of time and space in my case!\n<br>\n<br>James",

Then had a tuk-tuk tour of the back streets of Aurangabad, looking for alternative suppliers and the 3rd place we found had some in a slightly different style. Afraid no chrome on the rim of these, but they are metal so probably possible to get them chromed if required. Bonus is that these two cost about Â£2.50 each!\n<br>\n<br>Will sort out shipping and paying when I get back to the UK.\n<br>\n<br>So long for now!\n<br>\n<br>James",

Anyway, having just moved house for the third time since last posting here, I found the lights etc and was wondering if anyone is interested in them now? Not really interested in any money for these as I wrote off the nominal cost some years ago. First dibs to Erna and Shaggy, if they are still around. Currently located in Brighton area, hope someone can make use of them!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>James",
