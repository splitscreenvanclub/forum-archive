    "content" : "Well I’ve been cruising around this forum for a while now and thrown the odd comment in but as yet I’ve never really introduced myself nor told you all what I’ve been getting up to with my van which I bought in 2006. First of all myself; Hamish or as you all know me (my cats name) Ollie B. I’ve been frequenting VW shows since the early to mid 90’s with going to the local shows such as Doune and Avon park with my oldest best friends Bob and Alan who were then running around in ovals, buggies and 914’s with 2110’s before most people in Scotland - they still have them but as constant static works in progress! I’ve always enjoyed the shows and have continued to go to them what with Bugjam, Bug show at Spa and more recently Bug-in and SCC. However it’s taken me a long time to actually get an VW air cooled mainly as I’ve always liked going round corners fast but also It took a while until I could afford to splash the cash on a second car \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>However, in 2006 I spotted this split and I have to say that it is the best vehicle I have ever bouht.\n<br>It was with the help of my friend Alan that I decided to go all the way from Scotland to meet a the owner, a taxi driver in Ramsgate to have a look at it – in Alan’s words ‘buy it, buy it!’ on spotting the Double Door walkthrough arrangement. I also got a lot of advice over the phone from an old friend Mark who lives in London and Bob who’s always on the line when things don’t work for which I will always be grateful for.\n<br>I understood the Double Door / Walkthrough was unique for a EZ camper but not quite how much and subsequently since having the van I have become to realize that it is possibly the only EZ camper now in existence with this arrangement – if anyone knows another please let me know. Any how many of you may know of this vans history as it is the original Vintage Warehouse camper owned by Greg Banfill. I only came to finding this out following doing a search on Samba.com for ‘DD EZ Camper’ and from that I have been lucky as Greg has posted a lot of historic pics of it which I share with you here. Unfortunately I don’t have anything pre internet so if any one knows this van before then I would be delighted to hear from you. From memoary the M plate has it down as built August 1964 – 65 Model, German made and port of delivery San-Francisco.\n<br>\n<br>It’s not all roses though and there is a catch to my good fortune! When I bought the van I duly went round the bottom half with my trusty magnet and it is in fantastic condition - belly pans, underside structure, the lot - solid. However I did work out it had had an accident on the drivers side (1 shiny door!) but didn’t realize until I got home and ‘dug’ around that I found in actual fact that it had been rolled and worse than that, repaired very badly what with glass fibre, filler and painted bathroom sealant – all in the places where welding should be - a mess! Perhaps this explains why it had had two owners since being imported to the UK in 2005…mmmm…\n<br>Anyway less of my warble - pics and descrps…..\n<br>\n<br>Circa 2001….\n<br>Something missing?\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide1-2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Does anyone know much about the steps?\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide2-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I had some contact with Greg’s friend Al who owned the bus before him. The bus had been known to have been sitting and not running in the previous owners back yard for years. Apparently it was these previous owners who had rolled it and painted it green / white and no doubt did the well dodgy repair job. The bus is believed to have come from the Sacramento area in California and Al had bought it whilst at the VW Show in Vallejo after spotting it ‘looking forlorn on the back of a trailer in the parking lot’ I don’t think Al did much to it apart from a bit of house cleaning and getting it running, but it was Greg (who apparently got it for free!) got all the credit for making it roadworthy – at this point it was nick named ‘EL Rolo’! I know this bus is held in a special place for Greg so I hope you find that I do it justice.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

The roof is from a wreaked Bay window. The frame / roof had to be tweaked to match each other, and the roof had to be trimmed to match the roof. Then the bellows had to be trimmed to match the roof also. Not a show quality job, but to me it is one of the best things of this van – so useable!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide13.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Comes with the double bunks;\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a355/OllieB7/Slide26.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And with a small lowering job – gives a well smooth ride!
