Not all the time though.\n<br> \n<br> Thought its the carbs, so fitted some 36 IDFs but on a run, pretty much the same symptoms.\n<br> \n<br> Is it likely to be the fuel pump. I have noticed that the fuel king I have fitted (set to 3 psi) is barely full - don't recall this being this low before, but to be honest haven't checked before. You can just make out the level at the bottom just below the paper element.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s266.photobucket.com/user/presland123/media/IMAG0231_zps339c039c.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i266.photobucket.com/albums/ii275/presland123/IMAG0231_zps339c039c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Before I buy a new pump, thought I would ask for views.",

    "content" : "^^^ I was thinking the same thing, it deffo sounds like a fuel starvation issue. If you pull the fuel pipe off before it goes into the pump does the fuel trickle out or does it pour out? Let it run out into a fuel can for while to see if it slows down as the gunk in the tank clogs up the filter in the bottom of the tank. \n<br> I'm pretty sure my filter king is always full when the bus is running. SFQ but you've deffo got the pipes the right way round on the filter king? Reason I ask is because when I fitted mine I followed the instructions and the diagram in the box and it was wrong \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> Bus ran like a dog for 5 minutes then wouldn't run. I called eurocarb to check which way the pipes should be and they confirmed that the instructions were wrong and were also wrong in all the other boxes they had. It should be fitted with the vertical pipe as the inlet and the horizontal pipe as the outlet if that makes sense. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee.",
