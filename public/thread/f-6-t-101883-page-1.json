It now splutters all the way?\n<br> \n<br> It feels like it is restricted, or like the choke is on? Excessive power loss and struggles with any hills! I'm stumped to how this can suddenly change over night?\n<br> \n<br> It is a 1641dp running twin solex.\n<br> \n<br> Any ideas what may have happened?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
