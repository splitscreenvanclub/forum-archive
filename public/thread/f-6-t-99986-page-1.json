If I put the springs holding the two shoes together in front of the shoes they pull the shoes away from the backing plate, but if I put them behind the shoes they foul on the brake pipe connecting the two brake cylinders. Which is the right way to connect the two springs - in front of the shoes or behind? I'd appreciate any advice.",
