One has the ply back and alloy corner pieces, the other is all alloy. I know that the all alloy mirror is OG to our 67 and the wooden one came with the 66 interior (made in Oct 65) that I bought recently. When (if) I get some time I'll sort some drawings out and take some pics. Type21f and I think that both types of mirror were around in 1966 (not sure if that stroppy Nexus7 guy agrees though \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> )\n  <br>\n  <br>Seth - How did you clean up the alloy sheeting? I use approx 5% caustic plus a bit of wallpaper paste and paint it on to the alloy. Scrub with an old toothbrush, leave for around 30 minutes, rinse off with spirit vinegar and it comes up like new. Make sure you wear thick rubber gloves, eye protection and overalls though \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> This also works well with alloy casings like gearboxes, but you need a stronger caustic solution and don't leave it on too long as it will eventually dissolve the alloy \n  <br>\n  <br>This thread has revealed something that I didn't know about Spaceways - there are definitely two different types of cooker unit - side by side in this pic\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/926290.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n  <br>\n  <br>The left hand one is possibly the most common and is definitely found in OG 1966 and 1967 Spaceways. The unit on the right may be a very early version (are there any pre 66 Spaceways?) and differs by having \n  <br>- a fixed water tank behind a solid ply wall (cupboard door in the later units) together with an early Whale pump/tap, \n  <br>\n  <br>- different hinges on the small cupboard door, \n  <br>\n  <br>- separate demountable hinges at the rear of the top cover (which has black laminate rather than Virr Varr) rather than the alloy strip, \n  <br> \n  <br>- different rear fixing for the warming rack. \n  <br>\n  <br>- The Argyll cooker on these units has enamelled legs whereas the later units don't have legs and the cooker is fitted on to alloy rails at the sides of the hood unit. \n  <br>\n  <br> I may have missed something so please add to this list - it's like a 'spot the difference' game \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>Brian\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Hi Brian\n<br>\n<br>Do you still have both of these cooker units? as I was wondering if they are both the same size? I have the earlier right hand unit but I'm presently getting a version mirrored over to fit into a LHD and wanted the double door version. In your photo the right hand unit looks squatter, with the drawer looking lower, any help would be appreciated thanks Kevin",
