    "content" : "One way to check it is to bypass the connections which relate to the speedo dimming. I can’t remember which they are but look at the wiring diagrams on thesamba and it’ll tell you which terminals on the back of the switch to bypass. \n<br> \n<br> It is essentially a simple rheostat so adds variable resistance from max current downwards. I.e. it attenuates a max current downwards rather than turns up the brightness. When it’s turned to max it is effectively bypassing its own resistance circuit and just providing the current output at whatever it receives. \n<br> \n<br> I have had two break and when they do you lose dimming below where the break in the coiled resistance wire is, ie it starts to dim and then suddenly goes to nothing. So it is unlikely it has broken in a way in which it permanently slightly dims the lights as you describe. However check as above because there may be corrosion or poor connections which are limiting throughput when it’s at max. \n<br> \n<br> Hope that helps, I’m not an electrician so may have used the wrong terms, but I have taken a couple apart so I know roughly what they do.",
