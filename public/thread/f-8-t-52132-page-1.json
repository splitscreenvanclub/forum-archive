    "content" : "Hi Steve,\n<br>\n<br>My guess was looking at the colour and the dash area (Your dash and my 52's dash are almost identicle - thats a primer bus) it certainly looks like primer, the primer was a sort of semi matt, almost eggshell finish. It does buff up, it goes white when left in the sun and often rusty. It is all over inside and out coat and fairly thick looking, especially on the outside.\n<br>\n<br>I guess it was only really designed as a delivery coat. On my 52 oneside was stripped back and part of the roof to the primer, i blended the side but left the roof. After 2 years it is now mainly surface rust.\n<br>\n<br>A birth cert should confirm the colour as there were two greys too, listed as L21/L22 so it is possible its one of those.\n<br>\n<br>If it is primer then my guess would be it will not last very long before the surface rust appears without a barrier coat of some description, especially given the paints age too.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Mark",
