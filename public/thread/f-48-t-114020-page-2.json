Plus the shape of the sliding bolt looks very similar to the one we've been looking at. Also assuming that it's in the right place, given the quite close position of the rear leg cross member to the hinges (and my thought re bashing your knees on them) I'm now wondering if the short legs were supposed to be screwed in/unscrewed after each use.\n<br>\n<br>Peter",

    "content" : "Many years ago I bought a chaise longue at an auction in Wedges Mills near Cannock for £5. Long story but I took it home and put in the garden to work on. I stripped all the hundreds of steel tacks out of the frame which had held the webbing. Saved and washed the real horse hair to be reused.\n<br>It was also infected very badly with live wood worm.the frame was structurally still solid.\n<br>I put it in a big plastic bag to capture the flying beetles and soaked it repeatedly with killer. Kept rotating it and soaking it.\n<br>Killed all the infestation off.\n<br>It had hundreds of holes in it. I spoke to a local very well known restorer who advised to carefully work on every surface with David's Isopon and fill all the holes and smooth off the surfaces and then wire wool to finish. Then use light application of stain which absorbs into the filler and they disappear.\n<br>To this day I look at it and chuckle.. first upholstered in Cannock in 1804. Restored by me... so if you did want to do your wood worm holes that works well use something fine like Dolphin glaze..",

The ones on ebay look like the ones to go for – though quite a bit more expensive than the ironmongery ones. I've just ordered a pair so will let you know how they match up. The bits for my table are starting to come together but it'll probably take a while before I get to anything worth showing but will aim to post a pic or two some time in the future (if it looks at all reasonable that is).\n<br>\n<br>+1 for the pot/tray with salvaged useful bits and pieces in!\n<br>\n<br>All best,\n<br>Peter",

I wasn't sure from the photos how light your table top is but just in case, they offer a white pine effect, item number 252268521733 but without seeing a sample it's hard to see how close the match might be to yours.

I'm disappointed to report that I was contacted by the seller saying that they had an error in their stock and hence didn't have any. This is doubly disappointing as the measurements given in the ad looked like they matched those of the original exactly or at least very closely. I'll be contacting them to see if they might be having some in again in the future. I suppose the positive is that the stays we need do exist so must be around somewhere. To be continued...\n<br>\n<br>Kind regards,\n<br>Peter",

    "content" : "Hi Mark,\n<br>\n<br>To summarise where I got to regarding the sprung leg supports, the 10” size given for the ones I found (from different suppliers) refers to the absolute total length, meaning the length of the arms and the hinge brackets, all opened out and laying flat. In retrospect, this is most likely also the case for the ebay ones I tried to order. With the hinged brackets folded under, the total length ends up a shade over 8”. So, in position, the support would be about 2 inches short. Looking further afield, there are a number of different brands/length versions available from the USA usually described as drop leaf table brace/support, including 10” and 12”. One of these might be suitable but I couldn't find any diagrams that really nail down what their quoted lengths actually refer to. In the meantime I've just started Formica sticking down.\n<br>\n<br>Kind regards,\n<br>Peter",
