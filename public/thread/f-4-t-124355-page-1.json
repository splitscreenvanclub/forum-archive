    "content" : "I will probably regret this but I have a full set of 15” bus steels date matched feb 62 same as my bus.\n<br> Iv changed to alloys now and I can’t see myself going back to the steels so they may as well be sold on.\n<br> Apart from being rattle can painted black over the white they are actually in good condition. Very straight and solid.\n<br> 2 are fitted with 185 65 15s that have plenty on tread left and the other 2 are bare steels.\n<br> Looking for £300.\n<br> Located in Eastbourne.\n<br> \n<br> I also have a set of large logo caps that I may also sell if the buyer is interested.\n<br> \n<br> Here are the wheels anyway, feel free to ask questions.",
