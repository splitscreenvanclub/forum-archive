This is a legitimate, original 21 Window with Mcodes and original photos to prove it (Alberta delivered Deluxe, very rare! Who buys a Deluxe in Alberta?). You are probably wondering why it is priced so low. First of all it was very rusty when I bought it, the floors were rotten and the front clip, rockers were totally gone but it was original paint (Velvet Green) so I decided to tackle this massive project. It has had alot of welding done to it, not all of it to the highest standard (ie not ground down welds), but perfect weld penetration. So structurally it is very solid and rust free.\n<br> \n<br> It looks really good from 10 feet away but it does have lots of issues that I cannot deal with so I am moving it on to a) someone who can enjoy the bus as it is (hey, it's a 21 Window for cheap!) or b) is willing to fix and take it to the next level.\n<br> \n<br> Issues;\n<br> a) the biggest one for me, is the passenger side skylight windows. They are not lined up 100% straight, some of them are up/down and the front one was welded in slightly below where it should be. Structurally sound, cosmetically ugly.\n<br> b) Paint. It is single stage Glasurit, but it has runs, waves. It is not a straight smooth bus, if you look past the shiny of it, you can see imperfections. Cargo doors have some bodywork issues, and I scratched the passenger door (1\" scratch). Bumpers are still 'bumpy', but I have a brand new front/rear bumper (unpainted if you want them instead).\n<br> c) Headliner. It's god awful. No worse than that, I have no idea how to install it, but I pushed through and it looks awful.\n<br> d) Interior is brand new from TMI, Mesh Platinum, but not all of the panels are installed and the ones that are were rushed. Looks good from far, but far from good.\n<br> e) Sunroof cover. It's barely on. All the sunroof mechanisms are there, but missing some screws, runners etc. You will need a pro or lots of time to make the sunroof cover fit nicely (and of course it will need headliner below it).\n<br> f) Shifter needs work and clutch TO is wrong for the engine. Wiring is brand new but needs all of it finished. No e-brake (cut off).\n<br> g) TONS of new parts, but some of them need to be installed.\n<br> h) All the glass is installed except one pop out and front windshields, I broke the passenger side and it's just in by the rubber. \n<br> i) Mismatched rear wheel wells. Mismatched bolt pattern tires from front to back as the front has a Disc brake bay beam. \n<br> j) No belly pans on it. Yes I did use some filler to get it smoothed out but not much (hence the visible waves etc).\n<br> k) Door frames need finishing (vent rubber/glass not installed).\n<br> l) Reserved for future use \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> Link to lots of pictures (before, during, now);\n<br> \n<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/photos/116408604984795722448/albums/5868994334455785937?authkey=COS43f3lgqyIiQE\" class=\"postlink\">https://plus.google.com/photos/11640860 ... f3lgqyIiQE</a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Good stuff;\n<br> It's a complete, legitimate 21 Window. Everything is basically there for a really good price and if you are not super picky, it can be a good driving bus and looking bus. It has disc brakes in the front. The engine is a 1600cc Reman unit from VW of Canada. It starts easy, great compression. Brakes are perfect. New custom wood steering wheel, new door handles, wiring harness, trim is polished in good shape. All new rubber for glass. New tires. Transmission is known good and clean.\n<br> \n<br> TONS of new Autocraft metal welded in so there is no rust on it.\n<br> \n<br> Comes with new seat covers and all the correct seats including the middle seat in great shape.\n<br> \n<br> Still gets a ton of attention from everyone, but since I built it, I know every single flaw with it and I was going to keep it forever, but it's beyond me now. It's been parked for a year, and I have brarely touched it.\n<br> \n<br> I would highly suggest coming to view it yourself. I sell alot of buses 'sight unseen' with alot of happy customers but this one, you should view yourself or buy it as a very cheaply priced 21 Window and expect it's imperfections as they are. I have tried to outline all of them. \n<br> \n<br> Shipping available worldwide at your expense and I can assist. Price is 15000 GBP, and I have priced it fairly. Have a look around at the other rusty, totally incomplete 21 Windows and even with these issues you are a million miles ahead of the projects.\n<br> \n<br> If you have questions, please ask away or call me up (PM for my phone number).\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WdRBnZKxnL4/UXLbQIGUKdI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/fZVI_wRfn0I/w737-h553-no/IMG_3129.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ADHPd1_dm4U/UXLbQMwhqPI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/ZQVC8wVU-BE/w737-h553-no/IMG_3128.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kn4EgXHK6rc/UXLbQNjxkSI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/fA9zKq4q-Eg/w737-h553-no/IMG_3114.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4_iwRr85B3E/UXQpXkGBTsI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/X3pwx523Vvg/w737-h553-no/IMG_0312.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1NwHRAxfjE8/UXQpXvUFslI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/5oIVyqo1i48/w415-h553-no/IMG_0295.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y_wc5nybTWI/UXQpXufp4dI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/JczFDo1AG5k/w737-h553-no/IMG_0291.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NJLwja0eHRM/UXQpXoFmZRI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/AgeqPVCoILg/w737-h553-no/IMG_0281.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-AexMXcQ6tkk/Ub_jLE5b6yI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/u0iKuxswnFg/w737-h553-no/WP_000036.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
