Thought id give you an update as i made a big decision recently.\n<br>I decided that trying to find the airleak on the engine is too much of a pina on your own. \n<br>I know that squirting some wd40 over the leak whilst the engine is running will make the engine run faster and therefor let you know where the leak is.\n<br>The problem is the engine doesnt run and i need to be in the cab with my foot to the floor to keep the engine just about ticking over. \n<br>Ive tried wedging a piece of wood under the dash with some success but still not found the leak.\n<br>\n<br>So with summer around the corner and the bsttery tray still needing to be welded in, and just havibg bought a housr and moved and everything taking way longer yhan expected i have decided that Laura is off to Jeff'sVW Shack to have the last few jobs done.\n<br>\n<br>She will be in on the 20th and you never know, i might make it to the AGM with Laura!\n<br>\n<br>More updates soon.\n<br>\n<br>J",
