When parts are specialist (and everything Creative do is) then you can not expect everything to be in stock. I've waited months for stuff from other vw places but not worried me at all as I know they are not mass produced parts. big boys toys annoyed me greatly as they could not even get basic parts to me. It took 4 deliveries over 5 months to get me 8 off the shelf parts (off the shelf/next day from most vw places anyway). The amount of lies they told me about them \"just being taken off the lorry\" or \"sent this morning\" or \"in dispatch\" was amazing. My policy with such things is not to get mad, just to not use them again and tell them so.",
