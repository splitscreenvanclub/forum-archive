    "content" : "Not your everyday interior!\n<br>\n<br>This super rare interior is the same as the more known SO34 interior with the big difference that this has the lovely wood finish, it's also early and a RHD one which makes it even more rare!\n<br>\n<br>I would say it's 85% complete with all the major parts there, it's in a decent condition but will need a fair bit of TLC, the wardrobe will need some work tho!\n<br>\n<br>As you'll notice this has been stored for a while and some parts will clean up nicely as there's a huge amount of dust on it which is the reason why i'm putting this up for sale is that's all it does at the moment.. eating dust \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> i was planning on modifying it to fit my highroof but plans have changed. Im asking Â£1800, not cheap i know but fair considering it's rarity!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Included is \n<br>\n<br>big wardrobe \n<br>kitchenette\n<br>fridge/bar (complete with all trays)\n<br>3 seats\n<br>front facing panel under bed/seat with door latch and hinges in the right color!\n<br>flip/jumpseat which sits between the cabinets in the back ( no bottom frame)\n<br>Flipseat \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>I'd rather not split this interior as i would like to see this going as one.. however if there's enough interest in different parts and i'm not left with bits n pieces i might consider to split..\n<br>\n<br>Cheers Stephan",
