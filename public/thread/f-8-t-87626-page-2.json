A few more rivets to drill yet though. Then the scary moment of lifting the roof.\n<br>I've seen a few of the comments about the bonded panel. I should point out that there is only one join where this is used, which is where the top edge of the replacement outer sill meets the side panel. Anything that needed welding has been done. This hasn't been done to cut corners but to ensure the heat from welding doesn't distort the long side panels.
