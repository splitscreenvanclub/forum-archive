Tweeters mounted in the door card just under the quarter light.\n<br> \n<br> 2nd pair, identical speakers, main speaker mounted under R&amp;R bed with tweeters mounted in panels just under the rear side windows.\n<br> \n<br> This second pair (fitted in the rear positions) replaced my previously installed 6x9's under the R&amp;R, I'm trying to get some sound at a reasonable height for the kids, without deafening them as I want most of the sound up front in the cab area.\n<br> \n<br> Now, the sub is there just to clear the sound up as its amazing how a little bass adds clarity to a system. I'm too old for earth shaking basslines but still like to hear my music.\n<br> \n<br> All this needs a little tweak as changing from 6x9's in the rear to 6\" with tweeters and now having tweeters upfront has completely change the dynamics of my previous install,\n<br> \n<br> See pics above &amp; you may notice the positions a little better.\n<br> \n<br> Vaughan Green carried the trimming works out in 2008 and the panels still look good today (even if they have been stored in the dinning room for the past 2 years!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> ).\n<br> \n<br> I don't know if he would appreciate me carving his handy work up though for speakers, but sounds are a must (however Mark P's idea of the Bose units is a cracking idea if you dont want to carve your interior up).\n<br> \n<br> I carried out the install of the flooring with help from Bods, its kitchen vinyl covering 12mm marine ply. The panels/door cards, stereo &amp; sub/amp wiring, speakers etc was all installed by myself.\n<br> \n<br> Alpine head unit &amp; amp with JL speakers all round.",
