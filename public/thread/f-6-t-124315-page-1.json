    "content" : "I improvised and used my Screwfix \"Titan\" sds drill/breaker with a point chisel on breaker/hammer mode (no rotation). I welded 2 nuts together and screwed them onto the bottom of the arm thread to protect the threads and these then also located the point of the chisel. A brief press on the trigger and out they popped! I guess any impact chisel would work if you could keep it centred on the bottom of the arm without jumping off and damaging your paintwork.",
