    "content" : "At the recent committee meeting we clarified the Club's policy on renewing membership. \n<br> \n<br>Paragraph 26 of the constitution says \"Any member not renewing their membership within two months of the renewal date will be deemed to have resigned from the Club.\" \n<br> \n<br>It was decided not to apply this rule rigidly and to allow a six month period of grace, but this cut off date will be applied strictly. \n<br> \n<br>The policy that we agreed was: \n<br> \n<br>A renewal will be accepted up to six months after the due date and it will be backdated to the renewal date. The next renewal will be due one year after the original renewal date. \n<br> \n<br>Renewals will not be accepted after six months has lapsed from the renewal date. Any member not renewing within the six months will be required to make a new application to join the Club and will have to pay the Â£6 enrolement fee plus the membership fee. \n<br> \n<br>Dave Parkin \n<br>Club Secretary",
