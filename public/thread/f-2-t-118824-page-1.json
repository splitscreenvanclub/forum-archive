I have a splittie from Sweden that came over some years ago and will be subject to restoration. Can I get it registered with a registration number before the resto starts and it gets roadworthy?",

One of the documents I had to produce was a valid mot, this is done on the chassis number and a new certificate issued once they have allocated a new registration number. That was before they computerised the mot system, but I can't imagine it's changed. It needs to be insured as well in the same way.",
