There seems to be a problem with photobucket at the moment but you can view pics in SSVC rides and projects under the banner Between the Scooter and The Bus i'm kept busy.\n<br> \n<br> And no its not for the purists, but its my Bus and slowly but surely its getting to be the way i want it and the way i use it and probably when i've got it just right i will sell it like i usually do !! and as you all know i've sold some different Buses over the years and i have a liking of ' double doors ' i'm just about to put a really nice powerplant into the 15 so hopefully i will be getting to more shows, quicker ............. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
