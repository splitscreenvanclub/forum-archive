(Gonna be awesome!!)\n<br> \n<br> But after that we aren't booked into anywhere!?! We were thinking of visiting Wolfsburg and maybe Hanover and touring around a bit......\n<br> \n<br> Any recommendations for campsites and/or good places to go see? Anyone else doing this already??

    "content" : "Wolfsburg is awesome.\n<br> The Autostadt complex there has incredible exhibits and original vehicles on display,including a section on Ivan Hirst and the REME involvement in the immediate post-war period that brought a lump to my throat. You could easily spend a whole day in there. There is also the separate museum in Dieselstrasse with many interesting vehicles.\n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.autostadt.de/en/explore-the-autostadt\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.autostadt.de/en/explore-the-autostadt</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.volkswagen-automuseum.de/en/the-museum/opening-times-and-prices.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.volkswagen-automuseum.de/en/ ... rices.html</a>\n<br> So my advice would be to stay somewhere close/in Wolfsburg on the Sunday night so that you are in situ for a full day looking at the above.\n<br> The Bus plant of course is at Hannover (on the north side at Stocken). I failed to get inside the plant itself when I turned up on spec once. I had to contend myself with the customer reception in the car park which had a number of reasonably priced items for sale and a tribute to Ben Pon. Hannover itself hasn't much of the old city left after WW2 destruction. There are links with Hiroshima in the bombed out ruins of a church. It's flat and easy to walk around and nice down by the river, home to their most famous landmark the three Nanas\n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.visit-hannover.com/en/Sightseeing-City-Tours/Sightseeing/Tourist-Highlights/Nanas\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.visit-hannover.com/en/Sight ... ghts/Nanas</a>",
