Hope it makes sense. \n<br>\n<br>Was going to have brown and cream as on the outside, now he's put the red thing in my head, I just can't imagine it. The reason I am thinking of it is, he bought a 21 window some 11 years back for about Â£12k... We all laughed at him as he'd sold his Porsche to fund it, he's laughing now!\n<br>\n<br>Anyone have a nice classic red leather interior? Not as dark as oxblood though. Help.. She's going for interior in 3 weeks. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\">",
