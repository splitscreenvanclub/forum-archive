    "content" : "MOT exemption \n<br> I am thinking of applying for MOT exemption \n<br> However, there are issues that require consideration regarding insurance and breakdown cover.\n<br> \n<br> I have contacted my insurance company who say MOT exemption does not affect my insurance. If I chose to be MOT exempt, I would ask for this reassurance in writing. \n<br> \n<br> I have contacted the RAC regarding European Cover. Their Terms and Conditions require the vehicle to be taxed and MOTed. They have reassured me that my vehicle will still be covered in Europe without an MOT. However, if I do go to Europe I would also request this reassurance in writing. They also said that each country may have their own rules as to whether MOT exemption is valid.\n<br> \n<br> I will continue to MOT my van. It rarely fails, and I'll be reassured that my insurance and breakdown is valid.",
