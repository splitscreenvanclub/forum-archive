The back rest cover does not have any damage and is on great condition.\n<br> \n<br> These tears could be repaired, or they make a very useable set of original covers.\n<br> \n<br> I also have the 3 of the 4 original horsehair/ coconut type pads/ cushions as follows:\n<br> \n<br> 1) drivers base\n<br> 2) drivers back test\n<br> 3) 2/3 bench base\n<br> \n<br> NOTE: the seat frames are not included, 4x covers and 3x pads only.\n<br> \n<br> Sold as a set, £199 for the lot.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks,\n<br> Will",
