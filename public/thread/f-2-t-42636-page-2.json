Will the police if it's not a legit tracker?????\n </div>\n <br>\n <br>not sure Derek from the H&amp;D club told me he had that done on his samba\n <br>i thought it was a great idea because the phone will be fully charged and as long as there is a signal it could be traced\n</div> \n<br> \n<br>mobile phones can be tracked-somewhere on the net is a website that will let you know where a mobile phone is-it works the same as a tracker but cheaper \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> was in one of the classic car mags about 2005? \n<br> \n<br>cheers",
