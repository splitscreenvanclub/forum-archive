Well it's not persay, but it does require attention to detail.Except they were so oversized it took a lot of trimming to get them to fit. Then an equal amount of work to get the seams to run nicely along the edges. The top and side is the most important part to get right as its on display. The ends are tricky as well. They're not perfect, but good enough. I can always try to tidy them a little more once the seat base trim and rubber mat is fitted.\n<br>\n<br>I've covered the whole back as I couldn't be arsed to cut the majority of it out, plus its going to be obscured by the camping interior anyway.\n<br>\n<br>Edit: Did the other side to get them both done! It was much harder as the seam had a really pronounced join. Its not quite as straight as the other side, but its as good as I could get it.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/UK_Monkey/IMAG0828_zpspf073aei.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
