    "content" : "I wish to buy a Motometer style column mounted gauge holder. \n<br> Does anyone have one unused they wish to sell. I can repaint.\n<br> These were primarily sold as a gauge mount for a Beetle steering column. I plan to adjust the strap length to fit a Split column.\n<br> \n<br> I am aware AAA sell a similar mount but I do not wish to buy one of these. I want the Motometer logo'd one to hold a 1957 Beetle vdo tacho.\n<br> \n<br> Sadly Brezelwerks have moved on to other products.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> FOUND ONE",
