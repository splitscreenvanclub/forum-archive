Are you going to have a monster of an engine that your going to scream the nuts off at over 6000rpm which may throw a belt on the drag strip, if not its a waste of money and as soon as you have bought it you will have to throw away the tension pulley bearing and buy a decent one. \n<br>\n<br>If millions of air cooled vw's have been going this long i think you will find vw knew what they were doing,",

    "content" : "^^^ what he said. The fact that the bearings are cheap cr@p and wear out so quick gives me cause for concern about the rest of the kit. It looks the part but that don't mean sh!t if it doesn't do the job and last for more than 5 minutes. If the standard pulley and belt was good enough for VW then it's good enough for me. Unless you're looking to scream the nuts out of it on the M-way, in which case I'd go for a welded fan (berg?) and not much else or on the strip where I'd pull the belt anyway. \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee",
