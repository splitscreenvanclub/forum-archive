    "content" : "Was reading the thread in VW Related from Dougal about Kombi/Microbus changes for curtain rail fitment.\n<br>\n<br>Type21f helpfully posted this:-\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">The original Devon curtains had some unusual curtain tape fitted. This curtain tape was flat with loops along the very top edge. The gliders were small blocks with a groove all around the side faces. The loop on the tape pushed over the blocks and engaged round the sides. <br>Modern curtains are designed slightly differently. My description of the tape is that it is called lining header tape. This is sewn with the upper edge flush with the very top of the curtain edge.<br>The modern silentgliss gliders are shaped with a hole through the centre.<br>The curtains are fitted with curtain hooks made by silent gliss. These push through the loops in the header tape with a very small loop at the top. This has the effect of hanging the curtain up tight against the rail. <br>Do not use modern swish curtain hooks. These have large loops and hang down and away from the rail and make the curtain hang too low. <br>I can take pictures.<br>I spent a whole day trying to understand what was wrong and rehang the curtains. <br>My daughter in law made the curtains but she was really disappointed with how they fitted. I changed the hooks and they are great. She fitted rare earth magnets on the hems. .<br>Pictures to follow.</span>\n<br>\n<br>SO - rather than hijack another thread with a Devon related topic, thought I'd put it in here\n<br>\n<br>My curtains hang low (oooerr!) and I'm sure I have the above mentioned Swish hook - can anyone show me what the difference is?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers",

    "content" : "The tapes can be of different designs. A mistake often made is that there are draw strings to bunch the curtain up. .\n<br>These are mistaken for loops to hang the curtain up. These then sag. The pocket to be used is on the centre of the simple lining curtain tape and the narrow part of the hook pushes down from the top inside the pocket and then is twisted so the prong sits on the outside pointing up..\n<br>HTH",
