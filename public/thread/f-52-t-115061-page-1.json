    "content" : "I am thinking of selling my (circa) 1965 Chateau Mobile Lillebror Trailer Tent. This is the perfect complement to any split screen van of the same era. It is in very good original unrestored condition. The canvass is original just slightly faded. Has bunks. Also has original awning which is faded. Wood, hinges, floor and chassis is in very good condition. Braked trailer with original wheels and hubcaps.\n<br> I am going to get it out of the garage this week and give it a good clean and airing. \n<br> It will need a little work to make it perfect. New foam mattresses to start with. \n<br> We all know these are getting rarer and rarer in this condition and don't come up for sale that often. \n<br> I am keen to see what it is worth but am hoping for over Â£1,500.00 but obviously it is only worth what someone will pay!\n<br> Will send pics and more info once I take some or mail them. Location Bromley Kent.\n<br> Robert.",
