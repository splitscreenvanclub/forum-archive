You're probably right mate, it'll become to clear when the bolts and brackets arrive I guess. It's not holding me up so that's a good thing and I can do it last thing after the panels go in.

Black stone chip to finish but not on the OG arches!\n<br>\n<br>One of those days today where you get filthy dirty, neck ache, caked in seam sealer and feel like you've made little progress. I hate seam sealant. Gotta be done though. Still got to seal cab end of bus but I'll do that when I drop the beam out to slot the stock one back in. At the same time I'll fit the dual brakes. \n<br>\n<br>Kinda feel like I'm flipping between jobs but I guess it's just this stage of the 'project' as I'm waiting on a few bits to arrive.

And a load of hammering I should add.\n<br>The gear shift rod was also totally fried on so needed a right whack and jiggery pokery to get it out for between the beam. \n<br>Then there was the clutch cable. Couldn't release the front clip so ended up taking off the rear butterfly screw thingy and dragged the cable kicking and screaming through the tube.\n<br>\n<br>Lowered the old beam out and got out cleaning, sealing and protecting the cab area underneath. \n<br>\n<br>Then it was back on with the new old stock beam. Two jacks later and more pokery and the beam is in. \n<br>\n<br>Got the wheels back on and lowered her down and guess what - it looked exactly the same height - looked underneath and forgot to take the axle stands out. Classic!!\n<br>\n<br>Axle stands out and my bus is now stock height as she left the factory. I'm well chuffed and it looks so much different.
