I do have some video of the van being offloaded by crane from the Innesfallen, a Swansea -Cork ferry before the days of drive-on drive-off. I will try to add that to the file soon. The van is in two different liveries as it was painted in Ford colours in about 1970/71.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uNK70E1ikEdG5l0PT9f5wNi2B_hBQG8W\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uNK70E1ikEdG5l0PT9f5wNi2B_hBQG8W?usp=sharing\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

Was it like a roof bag?\n<br> You seem to have plastic covers on all the seat cushions so you can use them outdoors?\n<br> Nice to see the awning sides being used... even just making a cup of tea!

These were kept in place for years as there were seven children travelling in the van it was much easier to keep it clean. They only came off once they started to fall apart which was after most of us had grown up.\n<br> We did travel all over Europe in the van and enjoyed many adventures.",
