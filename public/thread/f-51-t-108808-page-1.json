It’s a ’66 model on a ’65 plate imported from Sweden. The van is stored in a garage for the whole year and is only taken out a few times during the summer for camping trips and festivals. It is well looked after by myself, having owned nothing but air-cooled VW’s for the last 24 years.\n<br>\n<br>I’ve tried to include enough photos to give you a good idea of the bodywork, which is pretty solid all round. There are a couple of spots that are starting to bubble here there, most noticeably on the gutter (photo included). The engine has been extremely reliable and every year takes me around the south coast, trouble free. The furthest I’ve taken it was over the channel and around Normandy without a single issue.\n<br>\n<br>It is a 1641cc recon engine with a 75 amp alternator and a rebuilt Solex 34 Pict 3 carb by Gower &amp; Lee. I have recently installed a new vacuum distributor (to replace the rubbish 009 that was on it), plugs, HT leads, fan belt and I’ve adjusted the valve clearances and timing so it’s running really sweet. In the past year or so it’s had a new Bugpack exhaust, fan housing and heat exchangers installed. It as everything to get the heating system working, but I haven’t hooked it up. It’s had a new fuel sender and aftermarket fuel gauge fitted. When I bought the van I fitted a recon steering box and brake master cylinder, and replaced all the shock absorbers.\n<br>\n<br>At some point in its past it was treated to the ‘euro’ look and had the door handles removed and was painted peach. The previous owner painted the exterior grey and it has solenoid doors. I’ve stuck a full-width rock and roll bed in the back, and there is also a second bench seat behind the front cab with lots of storage underneath. The interior would benefit from a new headlining and recovering the front bench seats, but it’s perfectly liveable and ready to go. It has a CD player that has a mini-jack input, and three pairs of speakers, two connected to a separate amp and crossover for some extra bass.\n<br>\n<br>It has just passed its MOT last week and so will come with twelve months. As mentioned above there are a couple of areas that could use some extra attention, mainly the interior, but it is a very sound van with a lot going for it so is priced at £14,950. Please feel free to ask me anything more specific. My number is 07702288835.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2043%2043_zpsvi7vcddk.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2043%2043_zpsvi7vcddk.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2045%2055_zpsflj94gc1.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2045%2055_zpsflj94gc1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2048%2011_zps1a67sy8v.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2048%2011_zps1a67sy8v.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2042%2032_zpsv7ejrla4.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2042%2032_zpsv7ejrla4.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2039%2020_zpskwtw7mfe.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2039%2020_zpskwtw7mfe.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2039%2013_zpsp04eb1zt.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2039%2013_zpsp04eb1zt.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2053%2039_zps0dbc4wjy.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2053%2039_zps0dbc4wjy.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2051%2038_zpsxouex3iv.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2027-02-2015%2014%2051%2038_zpsxouex3iv.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2010-02-2015%2010%2039%2043_zpsfhhfrla2.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2010-02-2015%2010%2039%2043_zpsfhhfrla2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1303.photobucket.com/user/scotto75/media/Photo%2010-02-2015%2010%2040%2009_zps9xfvplbf.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag142/scotto75/Photo%2010-02-2015%2010%2040%2009_zps9xfvplbf.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
