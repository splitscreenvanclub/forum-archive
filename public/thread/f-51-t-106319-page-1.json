    "content" : "<strong class=\"text-strong\">sold</strong>. Finally after years of waiting we have finally got planning for an extension on our house... very happy but this can only mean one thing... no more Splitscreens! \n<br> \n<br> The bus i'm selling is an Australian RHD 11 window Semaphored Kombi that was imported about 4yrs ago and came into my possession 2yrs ago. The underside was totally overhauled and new sills were added and blended, jacking points and a small section of floor. Other than that the bus is amazingly solid and has been treated to clear rust preventative. \n<br> \n<br> It has a very strong 1600cc on twin 40's that has just been tuned and runs spot on. It has been straight axled and the gearbox and parts have all been refurbished. \n<br> \n<br> It is tubbed at the front and has a steering box raise. \n<br> \n<br> New Safari windows front and rear (aged to match the bus) \n<br> \n<br> 6 new pop out windows (aged to match the bus) \n<br> \n<br> The front fogs are wired up to the Semaphores so flash on turning. \n<br> \n<br> The ENTIRE floor and sides are totally covered in Dynamat which stops vibrations and noise dramatically. \n<br> \n<br> Inside is a hand made wooden interior with grey seats to match the hubcaps. The table goes between the seats to form a huge bed. Has 2 cookers, one on the door and one inside. Loads of storage under all the seats. \n<br> \n<br> I have mounted a Propex heater in the spare wheel well which is piped to the rear facing seat so heats the rear, but I have also piped it under the cab (insulated) and it runs up the heater vent so puts really hot air onto your feet or windows! \n<br> \n<br> It has a Gene Berg shifter. \n<br> \n<br> New Hurst (Boz) Bar (aged to match the bus) \n<br> \n<br> 'Buttys' throttle linkage \n<br> \n<br> Leisure battery and split charger \n<br> \n<br> Anti theft fuel cut off solenoid \n<br> \n<br> Skytag tracker device fitted \n<br> \n<br> Stainless steel exhaust \n<br> \n<br> Ladder and roofrack (roofrack welded to gutter as I hated the look of clamps! but will easily grind off without damaging the gutters) \n<br> \n<br> I do have a camping trailer to match called a Dandy 4+1 please google them... amazing things.(now with a matching grey cover and that has been lowered 4\" to match the bus!) which if the buyer wants we can discuss. \n<br> \n<br> The price is a tricky one as there aren't many solid early ribbed RHD busses around so after scanning forums and noticing another later LHD logo'd bus for a certain price, I have based it on that. The price is of course negotiable as the building quotes are coming in.... but i'm not going to listen to silly low ball offers. \n<br> \n<br> THE BAD POINTS. \n<br> \n<br> The quarter lights are missing the locking catches, so were sealed up to stop leaks. The rubbers are there but the windows wouldn't shut tight enough to stop noise and rain. \n<br> \n<br> The roof is bare as I never decided what to cover it in. \n<br> \n<br> No stereo (apart from speakers in the overhead locker) \n<br> \n<br> The interior could do with a varnish as its still plain wood. \n<br> \n<br> It is tax and MOT free but can have it MOT'd if the buyer wishes. \n<br> \n<br> WILL CONSIDER AN EARLY BUG (60,61ish) AND CASH MY WAY. (non Oval or Split Bug) \n<br> \n<br> I think that's it, any questions or more pics please mail me at \n<a href=\"mailto:Jakevw@hotmail.co.uk\">Jakevw@hotmail.co.uk</a> \n<br> \n<br> I will help with shipping/transport once paid for. \n<br> \n<br> PLEASE NOTE..... \n<br> \n<br> The pictures have been uploaded from my computer and are at different stages of the build. \n<br> \n<br> ALL the upholstery is covered like the picture of the bed including the front seat. \n<br> The floor is carpeted. \n<br> The interior panels have been insulated with a product similar to Kingspan and then boarded in the same wood as the furniture. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> I will change the pictures to more recent ones when I can get to the bus in the light. \n<br> \n<br> Â£29,995 ono....",
