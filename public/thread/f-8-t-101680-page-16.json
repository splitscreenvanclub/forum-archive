Welded up the holes in the dash and did quite a bit on the b posts where someone had fitted seat belts and drilled about a million holes(no photos though) \n<br>I've got two more repairs to do, about a hour n half each I reckon and loads of grinding. I'm tempted to do a bit of filler, but that's probably to cover my dodgy welding before I drop it off!!! I'm not going to though I'm sure they can sort it. I've got a price for the paint job, but can see it going up as every single panel needs attention. It didn't look that bad when they came out! Not really bothered though as I'm that far into this now I just want to get it done.",
