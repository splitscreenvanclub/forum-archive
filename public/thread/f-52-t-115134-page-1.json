    "content" : "Hi, I have for sale a load of genuine Michelin signs and other merchandise mostly dating from the mid-1980 to 1992, the last year of production. There are a few bits from 1999 but its hard to find 100 year centenary memorabilia. Pick up at Volksworld Show is preferable, I will be trading upstairs in the swapmeet area but due to limited space will not be able to display these items but can bring them a long. Alternatively I will be going to other shows throughout the year so can arrange pick up then.\n<br>\n<br>Michelin White Plastic Keyrings, good quality New Old Stock - £3.50 each\n<br>Also older hard to find Metal type available - 10x available - £10.00 each \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20key%20ring%20plastic%202_zpsxkfhxi6d.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20key%20ring%20plastic%202_zpsxkfhxi6d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Key%20ring%20plastic%201_zpssamcwopk.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Key%20ring%20plastic%201_zpssamcwopk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Michelin 100 Centenary Butter Dishes New old Stock - £20.00\n<br>3x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Butter%20dish%20a_zps3qqarkdu.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Butter%20dish%20a_zps3qqarkdu.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Michelin Pillar Signs 31x160cm New Old Stock - £55.00 each\n<br>2x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/michelin%20pillar%20sign%20new%20design%2031cm%20x%20160cm%202_zpsneewukfx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/michelin%20pillar%20sign%20new%20design%2031cm%20x%20160cm%202_zpsneewukfx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Corex Michelin waving running Man 52cm tall New Old Stock - £18.00 each\n<br>3x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Corex%20Waving%20man%2052%20cm%201_zpse73xpcpx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Corex%20Waving%20man%2052%20cm%201_zpse73xpcpx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Michelin table cloths waving man 150x175cm - £30.00 each\n<br>2x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Table%20Cloth%20waving%20150%20x%20175cm%201_zpsz09vbx4j.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Table%20Cloth%20waving%20150%20x%20175cm%201_zpsz09vbx4j.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Michelin table cloths running man 115x192cm - £30.00 each\n<br>2x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Table%20Cloth%20Running%20115%20x%20192cm%20_zpsrqz08r0z.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Table%20Cloth%20Running%20115%20x%20192cm%20_zpsrqz08r0z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Goodyear Tyre Pressure tin sign nice used 54x90cm - £30.00\n<br>1x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/good%20year%20tyre%20sign%201%201992_zpswjkxy1wz.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/good%20year%20tyre%20sign%201%201992_zpswjkxy1wz.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/goodyear%20tyre%20sign%202%201992%202_zpsmz0xnyy0.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/goodyear%20tyre%20sign%202%201992%202_zpsmz0xnyy0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Michelin Special Edition Flag Large Rare 101x265cm New Old Stock - £70.00\n<br>1x available\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/speedbuggyseb/media/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Centenery%20flag%20101%20x%20265cm%201_zpsyak6ttyj.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v229/speedbuggyseb/VZi%20April%202016/Michelin%20Centenery%20flag%20101%20x%20265cm%201_zpsyak6ttyj.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

    "content" : "I bought five of these signs for over £170. They all arrived damaged in one way or another. I'll try and give a fair account of my communications with the seller. I did want to insure the signs before they were sent but the seller said he hadn't had any problems before and not to bother with it - that and he'd make sure I was happy with them at the end of the day.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">The following is all a lot of \"He said, she said\" but I don't want to give a one sided account.</span></span>\n<br>\n<br>The signs arrived four days late, not the senders fault in any way. The signs arrived with two of the corners totally worn through the packaging. I had bought two large signs and three small signs, so two of the signs had corners bent to a near right angle, one of these large signs was scratched across the face with 10cm long horizontal scratches, the new old stock sign had a couple of blemishes in the paint along with two bent corners. The three small new old stock signs all had small scratches through the paint, but it was minimal. The old used large sign apart from the new looking horizontal scratches sort of looked like it had been subject to friction while in transit across the majority of its face.\n<br>\n<br>I took photos of the packing and the signs and emailed them to the seller, and phoned him. He was understandably pretty angry. He said in an email, \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"You don't need to worry to much, I will sort you out, at the end of the day, the only major loser out of this is going to be me\" </span>\n<br>\n<br>I thought ok and left it with him. I waited a little bit less than a week and send him a couple of emails. He said that TNT would refund the cost of sending them but as they were not insured that's all they could offer. Then asked for me to send them all back to him carefully and securely wrapped up, where he said he'd replace the new old stock signs with new ones and refund me the money for the used sign as he didn't have any more of them left.\n<br>\n<br>He also said that doing this was meaning that he was going to lose close to £200 and another return postage. I had already thrown the packaging out by this stage, and to be honest just didn't want the trouble of finding new packaging to wrap them up then wait around for yet another day for a courier (considering I had wasted four days at home being told by the courier company it was on its way and to wait at home)\n<br>\n<br>Rather than the seller lose close to £200 I suggested that he send two signs to me that had a value of £30 each, I asked for two, thinking he may consider that and offer me one instead, and TNT were very unhappy with their driver so they may have carried them for free as well - but they were going to refund the initial cost anyway.\n<br>\n<br>The seller said no to this, and said, \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Because I am a nice guy, and I want you to be happy with the signs that you have bought from me, I am willing for you to wrap them very well and safely, thinking ahead about the reasonable care and damage potential and send them all back to me\" - \"As I say, you need to wrap the signs equally as well as they were delivered to me, or in all honesty they ideally need to be wrapped better\"</span>\n<br>\n<br>He said again the he'd be losing out on nearly £200, \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"For no fair reason, I will have lost the best part of a couple of hundred pounds here, at least actually, and you are going to be losing out on about £13.00 return postage with TNT</span>\"\n<br>\n<br>I replied, \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"I can see that you'd be losing your investment on five signs, having to reduce them at greatly reduced value as you point out, and as you have worked out on the best part of 200 pounds. With that in mind i'd have thought that sending a pair of much lower valued signs as a much lesser loss for you, as you are willing to take that aforementioned loss on the returned signs\"</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The seller had grown tired of this proposal and replied, \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">\"Hi, sorry, my offer to you is more than fair. I am not sending you more free signs, no way, why should I ?, that is totally unfair on me. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">I don't actually have to do anything at all, as you had no insurance, it is totally not my fault</span>, I have done nothing wrong, and am a nice honest guy. I am the loser here, and am trying to help you out, <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">so do it before I change my mind!</span>\"</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So to sum it up I said the packaging he sent them in couldn't cope with the time in transit, each and every one of the signs I had bought was damaged in one way or more, they weren't anything like they were in the above pictures or the emails I had received due to this damage.\n<br>The seller did offer to swap the new old stock signs for better ones and refund me for the used sign, but was clear on a number of emails that doing this was going to cost him £200. Would not consider sending anything at all for the way I had received the signs. \n<br>\n<br>I hope this reads fairly and honestly, the seller just didn't come out with the line, \"I don't actually have to do anything at all\" right away and did offer exchange and refund but like I have said, I was annoyed at the way the signs were, annoyed with wasting four days being told to wait for non existent couriers and then annoyed with being asked to go and pack them more carefully than when they were send to me and return the lot. That and I wondered just how damaged the replacement signs could get in transit to me again.\n<br>\n<br>They are metal signs, how are their corners going to be protected by a layer or two of old cardboard? I paid £170+ and had damaged 'new old stock' turn up on my door four days late. They are nothing like in the shown pics, but as was pointed out to me ultimately the seller doesn't have to do anything at all.\n<br>\n<br>So if anyone is thinking about buying any of these signs, ask for double cardboard and insist on insurance!",
