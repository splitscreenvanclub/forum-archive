    "content" : "I have recently bought a full seal kit from Creative Eng. All the seals seem normal apart from the Cargo and Cab seals.\n<br> \n<br> They are both exactly the same in shape and look like they have been run off one big reel. The problem comes when I fit them to the van...\n<br> The seal is extremely hard and tough to manipulate unlike other Cab and Cargo seals I have seen.\n<br> When the seal is inserted into the door surround it sits below its metal side wall? i.e the door won't seal against it.\n<br> \n<br> Has anyone else experienced this..??...\n<br> \n<br> cheers \n<br> \n<br> Greg",

    "content" : "Just in the process of replacing mine. Well I say replacing but I never got the first lot to fit properly, they were much too hard and the doors wouldn't shut. I've got some new ones from AH Schofields which are much squwidgier and do allow the door to shut. The seals on the cargo doors do sit below the lip as the edge of the metal door sticks into the reveal?\n<br> \n<br> When your trying to get them to fit I advise you to take the window frame edge seals off and also the rubber cheesewedges off the door striker plates if you have them. I had alsorts of problems which were cured by removing the cheesewedges (like the doors popping open at speed!!)",
