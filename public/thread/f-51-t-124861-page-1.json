    "content" : "Hello,\n<br> would exchange my 72 Westy for a split.\n<br> The Westy is in good condition, has an adjustable front axle and a nice interior.\n<br> We are looking for a German T1 LHD in good condition. Valuation report of 30,000 euros made last year. Unfortunately, alternator problems at the moment. Little things are always to be done - it has been standing for 4 months. I lost my temper.\n<br> So if you want to exchange a good split, feel free to report! Old V5 copy available, cause it was Usa Import to Uk and than to Germany.\n<br> Pictures per PN or per Mail. I canÂ´t upload here \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br> Greetings, Jens",
