If plod have been unsuccessful in finding your ride then you might want to think about checking the DVLA database every once in a while. The DVLA allows the \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">CURRENT</span></span> registered keeper of a vehicle check on previous owners details. So if you do a check and it shows up that your not the current registered owner you can get back in touch with plod and they will be able to get the new keepers address and retrieve your ride!",
