    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>Could you advise on waxing, im not talking about detailing here or polishing, baby steps first for me, i want to wash my bus then give him a wax. So i have the wax but is this best done by hand or should i get a cheap electric polisher n put a soft mop on it which i asume will save arm ache n time ? Also where he has some rust bubbles should i just spray them with a liquid wax (such as ?) as putting any pressure on the bubbles will flake them off. If there is already a thread with info a link would be great. Thanks",
