If I still have it in the summer I will be using it again for sure, The problem is it really needs to pay for its keep by lugging about scooters and engines etc etc but on the other hand I am always paranoid about marking it. Still looks great after all these years its a credit to your passion and years of hard work.\n<br>\n<br>Hope you and your family are still enjoying the pg/sg \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

I like the colour of your bus but it would look tough in a satin finish and the rims done in gloss black \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>Your not too old mate at 37, I was 38 when I had my first \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

That's what's holding me back really... But I also hate being normal and conforming to everyone else.. Hence buying the split panel in the first place..\n<br>really appreciate you input.. \n<br>\n<br>Your bus is insane, straight clean and original.. I always say there's a customer for every car (bus included) use it and enjoy it until they appear.. \n<br>GLWS .. Keep in touch\n<br>Regards \n<br>Ben",
