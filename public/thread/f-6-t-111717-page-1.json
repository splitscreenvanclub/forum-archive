How Narrow is your beam? and is it early/late/bay etc, may be someone with something, Maybe worth trying Creative Engineering to see if they have something, or if it is just the lower stud for the shock then maybe a local machine shop to drill that out and insert a new piece? just a thought.",

No undue stress on the shock rubbers. No clearance issue between then shock / upper arm / beam mounting points.",
