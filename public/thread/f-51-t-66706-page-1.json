    "content" : "£12,000\n<br>\n<br>Up for sale is my '64 Kombi. It has served me very well, taking me around the country come rain or shine. It is not perfect, but it makes an excellent, useable van, which will cruise at 60-65, and is practical for weekends out, as it has a rock and roll bed, and a few cupboards for storage.\n<br>\n<br>As far as I'm aware, it was imported from the dry states of America, and when it got here, it had new sills, and the underside was completely overhauled, making for a very solid van. It has been on the road in the UK for 5 years now I think, 2 and a half years under my ownership. It has slight surface rust coming through on the sills and along the seam in between the dogleg and side doors, but overall is a very solid bus. The beam has surface rust on it, but it will come with a replacement adjustable beam.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The bus is lowered on dropped spindles and low profile tyres at the front, and straight axled at the back. The 14\" steelies are slightly rusty, but it will come with a spare set, which I was planning on cleaning up and sticking new tyres on, for when I was going to put the adjustable beam on.\n<br>\n<br>The engine is a 1600cc engine, which was pretty much brand new when I got it, having been reconditioned by The Engine Shop. It recently (about 4 months ago) had a slight engine rebuild, with brand new heads. I believe I have new pistons and barrels to go on too, but never got round to fitting them as in the end I didn't have time for a full rebuild. The plan was to put them on at the same time, but as it didn't need them, I didn't bother.\n<br>\n<br>It has 6 factory pop outs, I replaced the rear 2 hinges with repro spoon latches when one of the normal ones snapped in 2. \n<br>\n<br>It currently has a couple of electrical faults, which will be fixed for when I go on holiday to Cornwall in it - But, even now with the electrical faults, it is serving me well as pretty much a daily driver for the past couple of weeks.\n<br>\n<br>ONE KEY FITS ALLLLLL LOCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (EXCEPT CHURCH KEY LOCKS, OBVIOUSLY)\n<br>\n<br>Now the important part:\n<br>The bus is for sale for £12,000 and I intend to hold onto it until the 23rd July, as that is the day I'll be coming home from Cornwall in it, but it'd be good to get a deal sorted prior to that. \n<br>\n<br>(No longer has the white walls thanks to a puncture taking the photo across the Derby countryside/hills)\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP2662.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP2720.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP3619.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP6173.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP3721.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP5228.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP3708.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>^Belly pan is rusty, underneath it isn't - I'll try and get it up on ramps soon, as I intend to get the rear brakes done before I head off to Cornwall in it. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0182.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0193.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0198.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0205.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0184.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0208.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>^I do have the hub cap, but when I got the puncture, I got the new tyre put on what used to be the spare, which I didn't realise didn't have all the clips - The current spare has all the correct clips, and a white wall tyre.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP9553.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>^ Some spares coming with the bus - It was my intention to put the adjustable beam on, and wrap the spare set of steelies in new tyres, and bung them on - but, I imagine it'll be easier to sell a practical but sort of low height bus than a totally slammed one (as was my intention if I was keeping it).\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i602.photobucket.com/albums/tt101/Rigamortiz1/For%20Sale/IMGP0207.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",

I do have first refusal on this other dub, which I was really surprised/honoured at as only a couple of people know about it coming up for sale, me being one of them. It is proper serious, I never thought I'd sell the bus, but to be honest, I really fancy a change, and this other dub looks perfect. It should also mean I can buy a daily, which is a major plus point (as I've never had one before, other than borrowing dads ....). \n<br>\n<br>Hehe cheers, yea its good to have a rock &amp; roll bed, thats for sure, the cupboards are good for storage though haha, but if it doesn't sell, in the long run I'll be replacing them with something more suited to my needs as a sort of weekend van.",
