Motorway is still 70mph. \n<br> A converted panel van is still classed as a van as it remains what it was originally manufactured as. \n<br> The grey area concerns things like Ford Transit Connect vans a s some of them are 2 tons and sone are 2 and a quarter ton. \n<br> So if you run a panel van that's had windows put in and made into a camper its still a panel van as far as the Road Traffic Act is concerned. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee",

I did query this with another 2 traffic peeps and they conformed that its classed as what it was manufactured as, intended for or adapted to, in that order. The first being \"manufactured\" so that's what counts. As for how they'd ever know/tell I have absolutly no idea \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br> S'pose its one of those things that they don't enforce to strictly, ike A-framing a car. Unles the car has been disabled or has broken down(emergency requirement) then its illegal to A-frame a car unless it has a braking system like a braked trailer because the minute you put it on the A-frame it ceases to become a \"car\" and becomes a \"trailer\" and so the rule relating to trailers now apply ie. over a certain weight(which it will be) needs to be braked. So most of those people that A-frame their race cars to Santa Pod etc are actually doing so illegally. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee",
