    "content" : "A brilliant weekend helped obviously by the fantastic weather. Official figures as far as I can gather are 237 camping units, 167 convoy passes, then add a few that were Stanford Hall concourse entrants, final 'best guess' for the convoy was 173. The record was 213 about 4 years ago, but even so a very spectacular sight and total chaos at the gate...\n<br> As you know Nigel collier is standing down as Club Secretary after many years dedicated service to the club, he didn't get away cleanly though and ended up as Events Co-ordinator. Club Secretary is now Steve Hall who I'm sure will do a great job. Big shoes to fill though...\n<br> I will be taking on both membership roles. The new members and renewals emails are both running and will continue to be monitored every day, I will be the first point of contact for any membership issues which will hopefully keep things simple.\n<br> Not sure about all the prizes, but most went to Carl Elliott's stunning 23 window 272XVA which cleared the trophy table. \n<br> Prize giving was outside by the winning vans so people could see who won with what and provide some better photo opportunities. First year this has been tried, sort of worked but with a bit of organising this could be really good. Of course the weather helped again.\n<br> Quiz and charity auction raised just shy of £1200 for Great Ormand Street, big thank you to Alan Schofield for paying £34 for a T shirt...unfortunately they had run out of change when he paid for it so ended actually paying 35.. At least it fitted him.\n<br> I spoke with a lot of people who were enjoying their first Vicky Farm, some really good feedback about the whole weekend which was good to hear.\n<br> Roll on next year",

    "content" : "Thank you Dave Eccles for starting this post. I was at the AGM but thought the same as you. Information about this event 'Annual Rally' (and AGM) are important and can only encourage more people to attend and get involved. Seedlings were busy as usual and Amanda decided that 21 years after starting the Seedlings it was time (I know she hasn't been involved for all of those year but has for a fair few!) to find someone else to co ordinate. No one stood up so unfortunately there may not be much for the children next year unless people put themselves forward. Amanda will make sure someone sends cards and Reece will continue with the Seedlings Page. \n<br> \n<br> I had a great weekend even though I really missed having Rosie there.",

I believe here and the magazine are the place for information post event like convoy numbers and pictures and prize winners and secondary is fb (although fb is a good way to show non members what they are missing!). I use fb a lot but still come here expecting to find lots of club info and stuff about the Annual Rally and AGM. I also would like to see the 'Report to Members' and other information included in the magazine for ALL members to see as not everyone gets to the meeting.\n<br> \n<br> Committee work hard (my family and I know!) for all members to have a Club they can be part of.
