Only trouble is that the handbrake cable doesn't seem right , I have brought 59-60 ones but the outer sleeve at the back doesn't allow the lever to pull far enough in to operate the linkage, can anyone see what the problem is from this picture ? I'm guessing I may have the wrong cables as I have got these almost fully adjusted up ? \n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160225/3003b7ce0967e6f24d9753f39d5893a7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

Unfortunately I fear for the worst with the gearbox though. I filled it with fresh oil tonight and ran it up on axle stands, fourth gear is grinding and it shakes the van. Guess I will find out for sure when in the road but it doesn't sound good. Either way I will probably just try and live with it for the season. \n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160302/38850fff7022299163fef25e1c0c1dd1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
