    "content" : "I went to connect up the indicator yesterday, and discovered that the wire colours are all different from standard \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br> \n<br> Its a reproduction indicator from Custom &amp; Commercial (so I'm guessing that it is a Wolfsburg West one).\n<br> \n<br> Anyway the colours of the leads are:\n<br> \n<br> 1. Black with a white trace\n<br> 2. Black with a yellow trace\n<br> 3. Black with a green trace\n<br> 4. Black with a red trace\n<br> 5. Black\n<br> 6. Long black\n<br> \n<br> I buzzed the assembly last night, and found out the following:\n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">When the indicator is in the MIDDLE position, the following wires are connected:</span>\n<br> Black with red trace + Black with yellow trace + black\n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">When the indicator is in the LEFT position, the following wires are connected:</span>\n<br> 1. Black with white trace + black with yellow trace + Long black\n<br> 2. Black with red trace + black\n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">When the indicator is in the RIGHT position, the following wires are connected:</span>\n<br> 1. Black with green trace + Black with red trace + Long black\n<br> 2. Black with yellow trace + Black\n<br> \n<br> Can anyone help me with identifying which cable goes to the front indicators, rear indicators, fuse block and relay ????\n<br> \n<br> Thanks,\n<br> \n<br> Phil. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\">",

I might have to make my own diagram up for future reference.\n<br> \n<br> Although I have a USA bus, I'm running euro style with bullet indicators at the front, and seperate indicators at the rear (not combined with the brake lights anymore).\n<br> \n<br> I think I agree that 4 of the wires are to the 4 indicators, and that the long black goes to the flasher relay.\n<br> \n<br> The short black is just not used (as my brake switch will go from the fuse box to the switch, and straight to the rear lights). It doesn't go anywhere near the indicator switch at all......\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for the help \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",

Here's the information for what each wire controls:\n<br> \n<br> 1. Black with a white trace (controls front left indicator function)\n<br> 2. Black with a yellow trace (controls left rear taillight)\n<br> 3. Black with a green trace (controls front right indicator function)\n<br> 4. Black with a red trace (controls right rear taillight function)\n<br> 5. Black with a purple trace (input from brake light switch, the wire coming from your brake light switch is typically black/red)\n<br> 6. Long black (input to turn signal flasher relay.To terminal 87b if using 4-way emergency flash system. If not equipped with 4-way emergency flash system, connect to Terminal 54 of original turn signal flasher or 49a if using a replacement turn signal flasher.) \n<br> \n<br> Guess that confirms that the brake light switch to indicator isn't needed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> Thanks for all the help.........just need to try it now.",
