I never wanted to sell it but it was the kick in the bum needed to go out there and start searching for a samba more importantly one we could afford.\n<br> \n<br>With out going into the niff naff of the deal we drove away from an essex barn loaded with what was a tidy looking , semi resto semi botch job.\n<br>\n<br>Smiling all the way home we envisgaged being on the road with it in a month or 2 after seat belts, tune up and remedial break work.\n<br>\n<br>On closer inspection the bus was hiding things we could just not see, years of patch jobs, botch jobs and just poor workmaship hidden by glossy paint, filler and blaggers magic. all of a sudden our tune up and go has exploded into a full restoration. \n<br>\n<br>Now, The man in charge of this magical transformation? Bob, of resto haus fame! \n<br>\n<br>Bob has now taken over the project and is proerbly one of the nicest and genuine blokes on the circuit. (discount needed for shameless plug)\n<br>\n<br>anyway enough waffle i shall now over the resto upload step by step pics showing the transformation back to the way it should be.\n<br>\n<br>Stand by .........................",
