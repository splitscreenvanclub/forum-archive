    "content" : "Well I went to Fred import south of Nantes, whose name came from the website in earlier post. Not much English spoken but the gist was, not sure what knackered but if he took it apart I may be stuck. He didn't want to touch it. Rang round some other air cooled specialists in region and one south of Angers said I could book it in next week for a week.!! Holiday season for mechanics as well as tourists so is understandable.\n<br>I decided to take my chances and limped on to Pornic the Mont saint Michel before catching Le Havre to Pirtsmouth today. Got by to sunny Staffordshire without need to tow truck.\n<br>Still has the play and the steering is vague (aren't they all) so I will investigate further now I have tools and garage.\n<br>Will let you know what the cause is.\n<br>Cheers\n<br>Ada",
