Looking back I did ask some pretty dumb ass questions! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\">\n<br> \n<br> Quite a bit of negativity towards pretty splits and of course the 'Samba stigma' but hope you guys like her. Just for the record, I'm not rich. Majority of funding was insurance money which is now on the road rather than sitting in the bank. Got to be honest a couple of wobbly moments along the way where I was going to give up and sell, but taking a couple of weeks out did the trick to get my enthusiasm back up and carry on. Dedicated to my Mum.\n<br> \n<br> Hope you like, look forward to meeting a few people at Busfest \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://online.flipbuilder.com/emlt/oubt/\" class=\"postlink\">http://online.flipbuilder.com/emlt/oubt/</a>",
