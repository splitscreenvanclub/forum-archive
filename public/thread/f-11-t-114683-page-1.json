    "content" : "A quick note regarding recent membership joining/renewal issues. There seem to have been a number of gremlins that have crept into the system, recently. We're working hard to try to figure out what has been missed, and more importantly, how. If anyone has contacted us and not received a response, firstly, please accept our apologies, but also be assured that you are not being deliberately ignored. We're hoping to get everything cleared up by the weekend, and will be contacting all concerned asap. \n<br>Anyone with any outstanding issues can email \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:website@ssvc.org.uk\">website@ssvc.org.uk</a>\n<!-- e -->. Please include your full name, membership number (if renewing) and details of payment date etc in your email.\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Nige",
