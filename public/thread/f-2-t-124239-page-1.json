    "content" : "Hello All,\n<br> I've been asked a few times to email our instructions to fit a headliner so thought I'd upload it here to help the Split Screen Van Clubbers!\n<br> I hope it's useful.\n<br> I would say that there's obviously more than one way to skin a cat and this is not the only definitive way to do it (so please don't shoot me if you have a better way!) but this is how I do it and it works.\n<br> Please feel free to add your ideas/experience (or mistakes!!) to help others.\n<br> This guide should help whether you use our kit (the best out there obviously!!) or TMI or whoever\n<br> Fitting a headliner is definately a DIYer job and not as hard as people may think. \n<br> Search Wonderland on SSVC posts for first timer's headliner fitting successes, experiences and feedback if you need a bit of inspiration.\n<br> Good luck if you give it a go and hope the guide helps a little.\n<br> Feel free to ring me for advice... before during or after fitting if it helps.\n<br> All the best\n<br> Chris",
