    "content" : "I am in the process of restoring a '66 bus and wondered if anyone can tell me if the '59-'65 church key style engine lid/rear valance and the 66-67 push button engine lid/rear valance are interchangable. The engine lid that was on the bus when I bought it is in need of major repair and I have since found out that these are as rare as hens teeth! So I'm looking for an easy option until I can find a good condition '66 engine lid or have the time to put mine right. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
