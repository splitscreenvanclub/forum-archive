    "content" : "hello all, how time flies....\n<br> \n<br> if you are interested in joining us on the 4th Oldtimers Cruize Devon, please read below.....\n<br> \n<br> as normal this is for pre 67 vw splitscreen busses ONLY......and yet again cause of the style of event it needs to be from START TO FINISH... . i am aiming this event at all types of us...... single, couples and families etc... so what i have been trying to do is get us all catered for. the cruize will include some good pubs that do good food, clean campsite (showers etc..) a good view, hopefully some dry weather, maybe another good pub, maybe a sea view, with good likeminded people that enjoy their own and other split busses and all in north devon... can you just imagine 30 busses cruizin around and through the devon hills and villages.... im sure you can!!!\n<br> \n<br> criteria.... it would be wise to have your bus all serviced up ( there are some entertaining roads, narrow with no place to stop, steep hills up and down..), all of which i would be more than happy driving my old 59 up and down (if i still had it) and my present bus. mums and dads are responsible for their own children. the cruize is all about start to finish, so you would need to be able to participate from start to finish (thurs 23rd may @ 2.23pm till monday 27th may.\n<br> \n<br> what is Oldtimers Cruize Devon XIII all about....\n<br> \n<br> meet junction 27 on m5 at 2.23pm \n<br> thursday 23rd (with a full tank of fuel) we will leave junction 27 M5 then cruize to a campsite , where we will pitch up for one night (elec available) also there is a pool available (pay to swim) there is a pub nearby, that do good pub grub, so after a long day on the road you can let your hair down..(remember we are back on the road in the morning).\n<br> \n<br> fri morning aim to leave site 10.30am we all will then cruize some more, taking in some great views and some interesting lanes (very picturesque). we will stop midday to have a picnic, there is also another pub at this stop. we will then drive some more... heading to our second campsite, basic with showers,( elec available). there is also a pub nearby, which im trying to sort out some entertainment... \n<br> \n<br> sat morning aim to leave 10.30am , this is time to refuel.... then a small drive to where we can have morning tea.... after tea, we will head towards a super market to stock up, then onto our final campsites for 2 nights. (good campsite facilities, hot shower etc.). once we have all pitched up, the way i see it is you do your own thing, there are a few good pubs and restaurants around . \n<br> \n<br> sunday morning leave 10.00am , short drive with some showing off....this location, plan to stay there for the day. late afternoon cruize back to campsite, there is no bar onsite but there is a social room which we can use..... maybe have our own cocktail party!!! \n<br> hope you understand and like all the above......\n<br> \n<br> i still enjoy doing this event, as i feel this is what our vehicles were designed for but it would not be half as much fun if the rest of you were not also there, so yet again i have been haggling to keep the price real!!! as things are still tight for all of us.\n<br> \n<br> now for the not so exciting bit..... i know funds are tight, and with an event like this we all have fuel, food, beer and general expenses on top of ticket price. so i have tried to keep it down to a minimum ( considering it's a bank hol weekend), the price is per split screen bus, ( 2 adults and up to 3 children) for 4 nights camping . £97.00\n<br> \n<br> if you are still interested and want to be a part of the O.C.D XIII and if you have friends with a split that you wish to join us, you and them need to email me with a subject heading “OCD XIII im in” to register.....inc your details ( how many in your bus, names, bus year, reg, and ssvc aka ). there are only 30 spaces available (including mine). once you have registered, and if your one of the first 30, you will get an email to tell you how to pay and this will also confirm you are on-board!!\n<br> \n<br> registration email \n<a href=\"mailto:buzz1959@btinternet.com\">buzz1959@btinternet.com</a> \n<br> \n<br> this event is first come first on board!!! so if you want to come on board, get registered..\n<br> \n<br> cheers buzz and look forward to seeing you all soon.\n<br> \n<br> PLEASE NOTE..... i am away till tomorrow eve, so you will NOT get a reply till then.... but i will go through the emails in order..",
