    "content" : "Soooo... I suddenly had a problem with my headlight flasher on my 12volt 66/67 crossover split... this has the headlight flasher and main beam on the indicator stalk... it suddenly stopped working, and you don't realise how much you use headlight flashers, until they don't work.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>I first suspected the indicator switch assy, so a quick dissassembly and that all looked ok, gave it a spray of WD-40 for good measure, but on inspection, the switch mechanism for the headlight flash was about as simple as you can get, and that all looked perfect....\n<br>\n<br>The (poor!) red arrow is the flasher switch part on the stalk...\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsf1d9ecab.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsf1d9ecab.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So onto the next part, when you pulled the flasher stalk, you could hear a big relay behind the LH kick panel click and clunk, but it wasn't a good sound, it went sort of cliiick, Ker-lunk, in a two stage process, this definitely didn't sound right, so off with the kick panel to investigate....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps71e3e6c5.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps71e3e6c5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Quite easy to get to, so I took it off and took it apart to investigate, as I'm pretty sure these late model big relays are difficult to get hold of, and thought I'd take a look see first, to see what was going on.... it seemed to energise OK when it was on the bus, so I suspected bad contacts inside the relay can...\n<br>\n<br>It looked like I wasn't the first to open 'er up judging by the outer lip....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpse25a3096.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpse25a3096.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps3793ce36.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps3793ce36.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>But once inside, I found out what was wrong quite quickly... it was a combination of things.... badly pitted/corroded contacts....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps61677e87.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps61677e87.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And also the relay contact bars had bent/moved over the years thru use, so they no longer lined up correctly....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/797193b4-c1b8-436c-b359-578b608b4f4e_zpsc60dabce.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/797193b4-c1b8-436c-b359-578b608b4f4e_zpsc60dabce.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>You can see that the main contacts on the top left are virtually half a pad out, and the other front flip/flop contacts are not parallel/straight either....\n<br>\n<br>SO a quick tweak with the needle nosed pliers in all the right places bought everything back in line, it was just years of use that have slowly bent all the contact posts out of line...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/5be1a8bc-f400-4f37-9709-535125a5b9bb_zps09e2f9ee.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/5be1a8bc-f400-4f37-9709-535125a5b9bb_zps09e2f9ee.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The main contact pads, especially the main top LH ones were in a quite poor state, looks like a previous owner had had a good file at them previously, as I could see the file marks on the pads, you aren't supposed to file relay points ideally, as they usually have a silver flashing on them to 'seal' the contact faces, and give a low resistance coating, and once this is filed off it accelerates the wear, but I had no choice but to give them the once over with a nail file to clean them up again, I suspect I may be seeing the inside of this relay again in a few years time.....\n<br>\n<br>But once all back together it all worked perfectly.... hurrah! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>The only other job I did was the indicator stalk was a bit loose on the column (are'nt they all), so before re-asssembly I stuck a sticky sanding pad on the flat garage floor and carefully sanded a touch off both halves of the indicator stalk clamp parts, put this all back on and its as tight as you like now.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">\n<br>\n<br>Hope this may help someone with a similar problem one day....
