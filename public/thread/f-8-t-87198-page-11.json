    "content" : "Right, once the masking up was all done I called it a day (night) and went to bed. To be honest I wasn't that impressed with the lining tape I'd used as it didn't do the curves as well as I'd hoped. If I had more time (story of my life \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> ) I would have bought some more and done them again. \n<br>Anyway, off to work nice and early after checking the tape was still stuck down. It was for the most part so I just had to re-stick a few bits. Once home I got a couple of coats of primer on and let it dry in the shed with the assistance of a small fan heater (it was quite late by now so quite cold outside) \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zps4lptwo3b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Thought I'd give it a day to dry properly then do the top coats. \n<br>Having done then (badly) before with normal rattle cans I thought I'd have a go with the same stuff I used on the valence as it's not only heat resistant but allegedly also chip resistant. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsddmbx8xz.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>It seems a bit thicker as it goes on but other than that we will have to see. I laid a mahooooosive bit of cardboard on the patio to put the wheel on so I didn't get any over-spray on anything and went for it.......\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

    "content" : "Well nothing much done really. I managed to get another wheel done so that's two down and four left to go \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> (I have two spares). At this rate I might have them all done by christmas \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> I'm not going to bother with pics as they're the same as the last set when I did the other wheel...\n<br>Hoping that over the weekend I'm going to get a chance to have two new rear tyres fitted and then keep the best one as a spare as I've got 4 different sizes in total now - two on the front 175/60x14, two on the back 185/65x14, one spare for the front 155/65x14 and an odd-bod spare for the back 185/60x14 that I can't remember where it came from but is a bit scrubbed on one edge. \n<br>Also had a play about with the passenger side seatbelt as I need a 3-point to strap the child seat into. I was using an inertia reel with a ratchet strap as well (don't ask - it didn't look too god but it worked fine) on the rear facing baby seat but now that Little Empi has gone up a seat to a forward facing one it was a bit of a pain to get it to fit tight. I used the inertia reel but it wouldn't stay tight enough so I had to basically tie the base down with a length of old seatbelt I had lying about. It looked worse than the ratchet strap set-up but also worked fine \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I've bought a static 3-point now so I can pull it all in tight and I'm hoping that will work without any bits needing to be tied down \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> My B-post has had a slit cut into it and then folded back to allow me to carefully slide a threaded seatbelt anchor inside it but the problem was that once the bolt was undone the anchor can drop down inside the pillar never to be seen again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> Wasn't sure how to get round this until I found a small magnet out of something electrical (no idea what it was but it was definitely something electrical) and I managed to open the slit again (ooeerr missus) and put the magnet across the gap and got it to latch on to the anchor plate. I then undid the bolt and the magnet held it in place (sort of) until I could jam a screwdriver through the hole in the B-post and into the anchor plate to stop it disappearing. I then managed to get the new belt/bolt in position by holding it all in place with the magnet. Job done and it's all secure. Due to rain and time constraints I've not tried the new baby seat in it yet but I'm hopeful \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

    "content" : "So had a couple of tyres put on the back today, cost £75 the pair inc valve and balance so not too bad. Went for the same size as before of 185/65HR14. I also ditched the odd-bod size spare and had the best of the old rear tyres put onto the spare. I now have two matching fronts and two matching rears plus a spare which is almost the same size for the front and a spare that is the same size as the rears. Only thing is that the spare for the rear is a directional. I had a Google and according to the AA it isn't dangerous to run a directional the wrong way but it is an MOT fail, which i thought odd as if it isn't dangerous why is but a fail ? Anyway, as most punctures are near side I had it fitted directionally for the near side. I also cleaned up the back of the wheels as per before to remove all the caked on road gunk and baked on brake dust. As they were rears it wasn't too bad a job this time and I just used a wire brush attachment on a drill then finished them off with some wet and dry and a clean up with some alloy wheel cleaner. \n<br>I'm still putting off that roof job \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/surprised.gif\" alt=\":eek:\" title=\"Surprised\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

I'd spent the morning stripping the paint off the last one and getting it masked up but then it started raining so I couldn't paint it and then I ran out of time and had to go to work \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>By the time I got in from work it was gone 9pm so I ended up doing it using the light from our security light and a torch \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> I had a fan heater going in the shed with the wheel propped against it to warm it up and the cans in a bowl of hot water in the kitchen \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>I was running back and forth to the shed with the wheel between coats to dry it off before the next coat went on and I hate to think (again) what the neighbours though I was doing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Anyway, managed to got it done and get the masking off without trashing the paint then it was time for bed as I had a 7am start at work the next day \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> Got up nice and early and knowing it was supposed to be a nice sunny day and before I went to work I put the painted wheel in the car with the seats folded down and made sure it was gonna be parked in the sun all day \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>It's been in there along with another one for a couple of days so it should be all dry and set by now. All going well I shall dig them out tomorrow and give them a wax n polish and get them back on the bus. Gotta make sure it's all done by about 10am though as I'm off to pick up a rather large \"little tikes\" playhouse for Little Empi. Not sure if it comes apart but if not I'll strap it to the roof. Can't look any more odd than the \"little tikes\" slide that I had strapped to the roof a few weeks ago \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Onwards and Upwards....\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
