    "content" : "Hi,\n<br> You probably would have noticed already but just in case...\n<br> Is the square hole in the grease cap or the square end of the cable rounded off a bit? If either of these, the cable may not be being driven properly especially as the speed increases. A simple and cheap way to check this is to fasten the end of the cable onto the grease cap with a piece of gaffer or similar strong tape.\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps.\n<br> Peter",

    "content" : "Hi Pete \n<br> well took the van for it's MOT today and the speedo was doing it's dance all the way there, passed it's MOT with no advisories \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">, on the way back home noticed the speedo was back to normal no more dancing so what ever they done when checking under the front end must of corrected the problem and I never mentioned the problem to the tester\n<br> When I did get home I checked the cable and the grease cap hole, no wear on the square hole just a bit of play on the cable so I did stick some duck tape on the cap \n<br> Thanks for the tip ....Dave (skipps)",
