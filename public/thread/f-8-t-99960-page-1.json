    "content" : "Well some of you old timers might remember a Black 15 Window bus set for great things, it was at one time fitted with a full 911 motor, 270BHP, 5 speed box and all sorts of other goodies. \n<br> It looked like this!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/c9f23a2f03c49cf0f8aebcd52bc5677c_zps8a21bb36.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Well as always families are full of unexpected funtimes, and things took a very sharp turn for the worst about 2 years ago... To cut a long, boring, depressing story short, we lost heart with the project and times were quite tough, I decided to take a few months out of work to look after my daughter, and we decided to sell the running gear from the van and put it into storage!\n<br> \n<br> So after a long break from it all, Im back! Unfortunately the van wont be fitted with a Porsche setup now, thing will be returning a little more to normal. We decided as a couple that we would like to keep the 'low' element of the project, but we could now live without the fast part of it, since life is somewhat slower paced now and we are quite enjoying it that way.\n<br> \n<br> I sourced a Type IV 2.0l from a T25 that had been in a front end smash, it has 59k from new on it with all the history, so seems a solid starting point for a good all rounder. I also bought the box that accompanied it, a 6 rib 091 box, which I think should be good as the ratios will match the motor perfectly.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/44ee36320a503ec9a848e2182598464b_zpsdfaf3e96.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> So over the past few months, Ive been spending what little time I have freezing my ghoulies off and plodding away. It was soul destroying to begin with as everything was so far from stock, it was difficult to know where to start, but slowly things have taken shape. Removing brackets that were no longer needed, and finishing off bits of welding that were part done, it started to build enthusiasm again! Its probably easier for me to stop waffling and put the piccies up now isn't it! \n<br> \n<br> Started off by getting it all back on the rotisserie which itself needed modifying as the frame interfered with my suspension mounts and at the front it stopped the wheels being fitted which meant alignment and trial fitting suspension parts was a nightmare, if not impossible! So i moved them further forward and back respectively.\n<br> \n<br> From....\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/c7b60b78487ff24a13fbeb4c551e8e98_zps3d6172d9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> To...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/e3f0596d1964639b54c65c1a44ef1280_zpsda0435ba.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> and\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/e19b69c99d551358781b2e5c70cca786_zpsc38aca06.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then I set about the jobs on hand, wont explain, will just photograph!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/cf12c31b7b4b9d7ad82497daf2541694_zps874f29b0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/5fa9ab7a911f16039b38b9f19bdd18c0_zps89ad8379.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Sorted, trial fitment for width etc...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/0919df09641800f5425278d742d339af_zps084664e7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Spot on! Just need to sort brake mounts now as the hubs are from an 87 Porsche, the bearings have spacers and fit perfectly, thanks to Dads lathe and skills, but the caliper brackets only exist on sketchup at the moment as they need CNCing.

We are really glad we did, as all thats changed is theres a little more rust!\n<br> \n<br> Yeah, the gear selector is indeed a side shift, so a few mods are planned, but if the 915 box worked then Im sure this shouldn't be rocket science! Im planning on keeping the stock lever and doing a bit of hocus pocus on the other (box) end, making it a cable change system. The nose shifter 091's are crazy money compared to this, and they accept scooby power quite nicely I'm told which may happen in the future, but only if we see the need, which I doubt.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPad using \n<a href=\"http://tapatalk.com/m?id=1\" class=\"postlink\">Tapatalk</a>",
