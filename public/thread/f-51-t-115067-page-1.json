    "content" : "Just spotted on online auction website with 30 mins to run. Hasn't reached reserve yet so might be re-listed. It's not mine - just sharing in case anyone is interested.\n<br>\n<br>Looks very nice and honest anyway.\n<br>\n<br>Described as:\n<br>\n<br>\"1965 vw camper split screen 1500cc rhd showing only 83162 miles from new and only four owners. has never been restored and in very original condition with the original table, sink, radio and even the radio cover. the camper drives very well and just needs mot and drive away. It does need the upholstry doing in the rear. has had no welding done on this vehicle and does not need any. there are lots of bills reciepts and even the service book with a little note book with dates and times and mileage noted down. a one off - a very rare find.\"\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.bidspotter.co.uk/en-gb/auction-catalogues/william-george-auctions/catalogue-id-wi410376/lot-0e887673-d8ff-44fa-8540-a5bd00f068cc\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.bidspotter.co.uk/en-gb/auction-catalogues/william-george-auctions/catalogue-id-wi410376/lot-0e887673-d8ff-44fa-8540-a5bd00f068cc</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Nige",
