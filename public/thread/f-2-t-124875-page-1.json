It is a 1966 13 window deluxe originally in velvet green and pearl white but I’m sure I saw it restored as a wedding bus after my ownership about 12 years ago and it was all an ivory/white colour. It would be good to track it down if anyone has any ideas on where it may be. \n<br> \n<br> Thanks \n<br> \n<br> Steve",
