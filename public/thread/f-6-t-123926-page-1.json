    "content" : "Hey everyone,\n<br> \n<br> I'm new to the forum i'm after some advice! I'm viewing my first splitscreen on Friday (76' Brazilian import). The price is good and the bodywork/chassis looks alright from the photos. However, seller says the engine did run but electrics were disconnect when he shipped it and he has not tested it since it arrived back in the UK. Two questions... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br> \n<br> Is there a list of key things I should be checking specific to splitscreen? Is it worth trying to get the engine running (worried its been stood for a while and oil may have dried out etc)?\n<br> \n<br> I have a T4 so i'm happy with the welding and basic mechanical stuff. I've ordered the Tom Wilson book but it wont arrive in time. \n<br> \n<br> Ben \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/bom.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"25\" alt=\":bom:\" title=\"bom\">",

That's the biggest saving you could ever make against buying a lemon.\n<br> \n<br> It'll take 10 minutes max' to reconnect the engine electrics, so if they're not will to do that I'd be concerned they're hiding something.\n<br> \n<br> Look at door fit, locks work, get under it with a good torch. Look for body filler / missing seams where the filler has just been loaded over panels.",

The one you’re going to look at if the engines not running it’s probably knackered! and he trying to sell you a pup!\n<br> Good look cheers John",

Couldn't see the engine running but isnt seized and appears to be in good order. Fair few parts missing lights bumpers etc.\n<br> \n<br> The seller is after £8k for it which is around my budget for the base vehicle. \n<br> \n<br> I'm only apprehensive as its a bit of a shot in the dark with the engine. Planning to do a full engine rebuild anyway so should I be worried? Or should I hold out and keep looking? \n<br> \n<br> Am I be completely nieve thinking I can get a half decent import for this price!? \n<br> \n<br> Ben",
