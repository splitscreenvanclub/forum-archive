    "content" : "Thanks. Reading back, it reminds me of how much I've actually done. Need to put up some pictures of it while it's still clean from the show.\n<br> \n<br> I missed out a couple of updates.\n<br> \n<br> I took the gearbox out last November, because the gear shift was terrible. I'd be lucky to get third without grinding.\n<br> \n<br> With the box out of the truck, I replaced the M spring and metal shuttlecock bushing and had new brass bushes made to fit the nosecone and hockey stick.\n<br> \n<br> I had a bunch of other jobs to do while the box was out (rust proofing etc), so I only had a chance to get it back in last month.\n<br> \n<br> After refitting the gearbox though, I still couldn't get third properly.\n<br> \n<br> A final straw came when I tried to fully torque up the right hand RGB-to-spring plate bolts. One of the bolts had a different, coarse thread, so I figured the previous owner who fitted that gearbox, had stripped the hole and re-tapped it for a coarser bolt. When I tried to torque it up though it just ripped the threads out of the hole. They'd just screwed a coarser bolt in and not bothered to torque it properly. When I torqued it properly, it just tore the threads out.\n<br> \n<br> I hired a time-sert kit to fix the stripped hole properly, but I didn't realise how much it had ovalled because the spring plate had been smacking on the loose bolt. The thread cutting tap went in at an odd angle and I broke one of the flutes. At that point; with me having spent god knows how long on the truck over the winter, my wife decided that we should get the box rebuilt and the stripped bolt hole fixed. Getting her husband back was worth the cost of a gearbox rebuild.\n<br> \n<br> The bolt stripped at about 3pm on a Saturday. I Googled Bears and Cogbox's websites, but it was past closing time, so I figured I'd have to wait until the following week to book the box in for a rebuild. I'd already booked for today's Plum Jam and it was about a month away, so I was p155ed that I'd probably miss it, but my wife decided to try calling Cogbox anyhow and Peter picked up the phone. After speaking with him, I decided that he was the guy I wanted to do the job. I already had the following Monday booked off as holiday, so I arranged to drop the box off with him on the Monday.\n<br> \n<br> Peter had a couple of boxes ahead of mine in the queue, but he stripped it down and called me about a week later. He diagnosed that third looked OK but 2nd and 4th were pretty hammered. The rebuild cost was scary, but I wanted it done, I've heard good things about his work and I got a good vibe from him when I dropped the box off, so I had him go ahead and rebuild it and fix the knackered RGB springplate bolt hole while he was at it.\n<br> \n<br> A few days later, Peter called me to say it was ready, so I picked the box up on the Saturday and started to put it back in the truck.\n<br> \n<br> That was a few weeks ago. I had to go up to Blackpool for work that coming week, so I knew I'd have to steam in to it if I was to meet my deadline of being back on the road for Plum Jam. I worked every evening after I got back from Blackpool and all last weekend to get it back together. While the gearbox was out originally, I'd sorted some wiring issues, but couldn't finish and test any of that with the truck in the garage, so I had to finish that as well after I'd got the box back in and I was able to roll it outside.\n<br> \n<br> I finally managed a quick shake-down run round the block on Thursday and another one yesterday. That was cutting it close enough for me. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\">",

The second set are fine though.\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=25091&amp;sid=0761606862621d55fd5b89e3f7d1c26a&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=25091&amp;t=1&amp;sid=0761606862621d55fd5b89e3f7d1c26a\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"DSC_0495-001.JPG\" title=\"DSC_0495-001.JPG (82.45 KiB) Viewed 2873 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> After doing these, I decided they're probably too nice, so bought some used, cheapo chrome hubcaps to use for day-to-day use.

Then I got the grinder out and cut the bolt-together bows to make them height adjustable.\n<br> \n<br> Outside with the bows at full height, I test fitted the complete tilt and bows set. I bought these from NLA VW last year and had slats made locally.\n<br> \n<br> If I was doing this again, I'd ask NLA VW what size slats they intended to use. I think they used thinner ones than I did. I took the specs from dropgates.com so mine should be stock size, but when I fitted them, I found that the bolt holes for the two outermost slats didn't line up, so I had to re-drill those.\n<br> \n<br> The tilt is a snug fit, but went on quite easily and it took seconds to remove it. VW had the design spot on for ease of use. Folding it up to get it back in the bag took longer than fitting and removing it.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755048.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755051.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755052.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> This was the first time I've seen it outside with the chrome hubcaps that it would have had when new.

    "content" : "These hoops look the same as VW's originals but NLA VW altered the design slightly. VW's originals were sent to dealers with the legs of the hoops separate from the curved parts and the dealer had to weld the bits together, then paint them. These have tongues welded on to the hoops where the VW ones are welded to the legs. The tongues fit inside the legs and bolt through them so you don't have to weld the curves to the legs.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755336.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> They did that to make them easier to ship, but it also means that you can take the whole top off with the slats. That gave me an idea...\n<br> \n<br> There isn't enough headroom in my garage to park the truck with the bows at stock height and it's not practical to take the whole kit apart and reassemble it when I want to use the tilt, so I got the grinder out and set about altering the bows for daily use.\n<br> \n<br> I had a local blacksmith make up some inserts like the tongues that were welded to the curved parts of the bows, but these are about a foot long. I measured the difference in height between the top of the bows and the cab roof, and cut that amount off the top of each leg, then drilled the cut pieces and bolted the inserts to the cut pieces.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755338.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then I set the top part with the slats down on the cut legs and drilled them to match the bolt holes on the tongues on the curved part. I need to get some more hardware, but I'm going to use wing nuts and spacers for those fixings so they're quick to bolt up and release.\n<br> \n<br> It fits neatly in the garage now and I shouldn't have any problems with car park height limits either.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1755054.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> To raise the bows back to full height to fit the tilt, I'll unbolt the curved part of the bows, bolt the reinforced cut out pieces back in and bolt the curve part down to those.\n<br> \n<br> I just need to paint the inserts, get some cap screws to bolt them together and touch up where I cut and drilled the original legs.",

Errol has a 1600 dual port with a genuine Solex 34 PICT 3 carb matched to the correct european-spec SVDA distributor but it would not idle.\n<br> \n<br> I'd tried tuning it loads of times and I could get it idling fine, but then I'd take it for a drive and there was a fair chance that it would stall as soon as I came to a stop. The problem wasn't consistent, sometimes it would idle fine, sometimes I'd have to give it some gas at lights just to keep it running.\n<br> \n<br> I could also never get it to just start from cold on the key, I'd have to pump the gas while I cranked it and hold my foot on the gas it for 15-20 seconds to get it to warm up a little, then it would idle, but barely. It never fast idled, even though I checked the choke etc. were working fine.
