I think there is a good one out there. I see the term CKD (Complete Knock Down) used a lot for Australian buses, but I am not 100% sure exactly what it means. I thought they would have stopped CKD production when the Clayton factory was up and running in the late 50s, but it appears to continue right through the split van production. I assume your bus was imported from Australia? Interesting research ahead for you I think! Keep us posted.",

Just have a look underneath and see if the nose cone mount currently looks like a donut or like flat plate with a square rubber section.\n<br>\n<br>If its the later flat plate with a square rubber section type then the pre-63 gearbox you've got will go straight in once you've fitted a nose cone to it.\n<br>\n<br>If you have the earlier type, then there's an adapter kit that you can get that does the job to allow the later nose cone fitting.",

I'm pretty sure unless I have a special 12v 1967 only gearbox, I will need to either fit a 6v flywheel, or trim a 6v gearbox to clear a 12v flywheel. \n<br>\n<br>After mentioning on here I was really after a large hub nut transmission, not small nut, I have been offered a 1965 one, hub nut to hub nut! (Cheers for the tip off Ben! And thanks Will \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> )\n<br>So, the small nut 1500 box above is up for grabs. I paid £60 for it. Open to offers. I got it disassembled in boxes so no idea what it's like.",
