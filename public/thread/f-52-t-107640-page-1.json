    "content" : "Bought this back in 2012, took it around the park twice and it had sat in the garage ever since.\n<br>\n<br>The bike really is in showroom condition! \n<br>Cost £1400 + £50 for upgraded pedals and another £60ish quid on helmet, pump and bottle holder. Was hoping to get £800 for the lot, but willing to accept £700 firm. (If I take any less I will be getting a divorce)\n<br>\n<br>If your in the market or know of anyone who might be interested in a quality bike without having to pay a premium price it's well worth a look. Bike is located in Cheltenham.\n<br>\n<br>Cash goes towards the fund for Red 9 Design running gear and a quality paint job!",
