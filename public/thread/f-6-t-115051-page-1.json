Will this lift my front, I'm guessing by 2.5\" is that the normal spindle height or is it more?\n<br> \n<br> Also running beetle rear straight arms on a freeway flyer, if I just rotate my spring arms the required number of splines will this get it level? Then add new shocks...\n<br> \n<br> I'm just wanting to go back \"up\" as much as reasonably possible, but just double checking this is what I need to do.?\n<br> Many thanks.\n<br> Mike",
