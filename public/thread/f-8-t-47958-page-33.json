I have a huge list of things that I could do with finishing before I even get started on bodywork. I'm also being made redundant next year sometime so it would not be sensible to spend a load of money on paint, panels, wheels, tyres, suspension etc etc and then still have a list of things that I haven't finished. \n<br>\n<br> So Bertha will be staying as is for one more year at least.

Fecking orrible place. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br> Got a spare half hour with the bus today so I decided to fit one of Buttys new fandango throttle linkage kits. Didn't think mine was that bad but liked the look of it and got one off him at Brands Hatch the other week.\n<br>\n<br> The kit.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/IMG-20120929-00142.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br> Very well made. Nice and simple to do. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br> The old offending item.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/IMG-20120929-00145.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/IMG-20120929-00144.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br> New one going on. Only two small mods to make. 1. Cut off half the U shaped bracket that the original pivot linkage fits in. And cut out a small part of the acclerator pedal to clear the new ball joint fixing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/IMG-20120929-00146.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/IMG-20120929-00147.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br> Once it was all fitted and I'd reset the carb end of the cable I took the bus for a spin.\n<br>\n<br> It made an incredible difference! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br> Ok maybe I had a little slack in my original system but its amazing.\n<br>\n<br> Instant throttle response, really smooth action, return spring makes a difference too.\n<br>\n<br> I reckon I'm getting about 30% more throttle from fitting this. I am now able to cruise uphill at motorway speeds without slowing down. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br> Thanks Butty. Keep on making the mods. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br>\n<br> Nick",

Big empty hole in the garage. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br> Been using the bug instead to get my aircooled fix but am missing the bus big time now the weather's starting to warm up.\n<br>\n<br> The good news is its been at VW Jim's for the winter. He was developing a LHD steering rack kit and was after a bus to use a a template so I offered my old jalopy for its services.\n<br>\n<br> Fingers crossed I'll have it back in the next couple of weeks. Whilst it's been there I've also asked him to fit a dual master cylinder and a servo so it should stop as well as it steers. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br> I have also ordered a complete 4\" narrowed beam from project 01 which should be ready for me to collect next week. Had a good long chat with Charlie and I'm happy that he's making me what I want.\n<br>\n<br> The reason for the new beam is that I've got a new set of wheels on the way. Was just about to order a set of BTR wheels when some others caught my eye. They will be the 1st set in the UK and are wide 5 fitment. They are absolutely perfect for my bus and I can't wait! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br> Very very excited about all of this.\n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br>\n<br> Nick",
