    "content" : "Thanks for the comments.\n<br>\n<br>I am mostly thinking original as much as possible, retaining as much original as possible.\n<br>\n<br>Hi Dean, yes I remember. I think that was when you started on your 54? 5 years. No way! I thought it was a year or 2 ago max.. so I checked; it was Mar 2004! \n<br>Not sure what pics I sent you BTW but I couldnt find any I had taken around then so if you still have them do post them, they must lurk on a memory stick here somewhere.\n<br>\n<br>Just looked at the paperwork, 2 previous owners, last just up the road in Hampshire also I found some notes I made in 1990 so that was possibly shortly after I got hold of it (I must have been around 11 or so..). Total cost of required panels to restore was £300 (Musclebus/Chris, I will be in touch re some steel.. )\n<br>\n<br>There is a tatty old notebook I found in the cab that lists mileages between refills, even oil changes, plugs etc. That notebook appears to go from 73 to 76 (7 Gals £4?!) apparently driven frequently between Fishers(?), Exeter and London (23mpg) and mentions reserve so I am not sure if that was with the current fuel tank arrangement. I also need to get the certificate from VW.\n<br>\n<br>I assume the fuel tank is 60's, there is another in the back but not sure if it is BD? I dont think I have a wheel tray, I do have a barndoor lid, not the orig which was once around but dissapeared complete with fittings (It was fine[very] but I am sure it went to scrap). I have some other parts stowed.\n<br>\n<br>It had a later dash installed, removed just before I got hold of it, unfortunately at that time some areas were stripped to metal and it was then left uncovered for a while. Some kids started to damage it - smashed a window or 2, lit a fire in it.. Things were going downhill rapidly. I spent all my pocket money(OK student grant) and eventually got it and stored it.\n<br>\n<br>The shift knob is a bit odd, the bus was updated with 60's dash and steering wheel but the shift knob is early KDF logo - from what?\n<br>\n<br>I think the engine number matches the reg doc, it looks correct(?) but I need to check again. \n<br>\n<br>There is a spare beam assembly in the back - is it early? also there is an extra set of reduction boxes.\n<br>\n<br>I will try to get it rolling tomorrow, so maybe better pics.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo239/tango1954/54_081023/P1010179.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo239/tango1954/54_081023/P1010180.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo239/tango1954/54_081023/P1010187.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo239/tango1954/54_081023/P1010198.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i379.photobucket.com/albums/oo239/tango1954/54_081023/P1010206.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
