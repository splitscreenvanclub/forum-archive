Thanks in advance Simon \n </div>\n</blockquote> Hi Simon,\n<br> \n<br> yep - you got it - make sure you are TDC with the rotor arm pointing to No.1 plug wire. I tend to mark the plug leads with a sharpie, just so you know which is which, as the 123 has a slightly different cap - firing order 1 4 3 2 - so no 1 you know, then lead 4, lead 3 etc going clockwise.\n<br> Remove old dizzy - put in new 123 in pointing roughly where you want it (note the 123 doesn't go fully down like the Bosch did) - hold the rotor arm against the lash of the drive gear (ie push towards battery) and turn the 123 body slowly towards the battery until the green led inside just comes on - then tighten clamp and that's it - its now at TDC - do not move it, or time it, or strobe it or anything - everything is now done from the 123 Tune App. Fit your plug wires as they came off - rotor is pointing at No.1, then 4, 3 etc.\n<br> \n<br> The anti-pulse - not sure about - but if you needed it before with your Dells to get a good Vac signal I'd leave it in place.\n<br> \n<br> I've found the Mallory 32 advance curve to be the best - but I took a smidge of Advance off on the MAP curve - down to 8 from 10 as it was a bit jerky at low rpm/high vac - changing to 8deg smoothed this out - it all depends how much Vac you are pulling off your Dells - the only other thing I did was add a touch more adv at Centrifugal idle to smooth the idle.\n<br> \n<br> Create a curve in your 123 Tune App - add these numbers below - then write the file to your 123 and save the file in the app in case you want to fiddle, or ever need to rewrite it again.\n<br> \n<br> CENTRIFUGAL:\n<br> 500rpm = 0.0\n<br> 800rpm = 8.0\n<br> 1000rpm = 12.0\n<br> 1500rpm = 15.0\n<br> 2000rpm = 21.0\n<br> 2500rpm = 32.0\n<br> 8000rpm = 32.0\n<br> \n<br> MAP (if using a vac pipe)\n<br> Abs kP 0 = 8.0\n<br> Abs kP 60 = 8.0\n<br> Abs kP 73 = 8.0\n<br> Abs kP 87 = 0.0\n<br> Abs kP 100 = 0.0\n<br> Abs kP 200 = 0.0\n<br> \n<br> If your nervous about running 32 deg advance just knock the last 2 numbers down at 2500rpm/8000rpm to 30deg. - or save 2 files - 1 at 32deg adv and one at 30deg adv and you can swap between them and see which feels best - on my engine with Kadrons, the 32 is best.\n<br> Until we get one rolling roaded these are the best numbers so far in my experience and are a very good starting point.",
