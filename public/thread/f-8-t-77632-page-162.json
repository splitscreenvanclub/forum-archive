I will trim the rubber as needed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> thanks for the heads up \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br> \n<br>Nigel\n<br>Yep I'm hoping to trim all the inside myself ...... Well with the help of my Claire on the sewing machine \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> ..... We intend to do it all ..... Door cards .....seats ..... Cushion ......everything ..... And if they are not great then I can always do it again in the future or pass it to a pro ...... But you know how it is guys these buses are not cheep to restore so I have to cut back on spending out on things I can make or have a go at doing it myself as I need to spend money on new parts and I only want to buy stuff once so going for good quality parts is a must ! And every time I order something it's hurts \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad1.gif\" alt=\":sad1:\" title=\"sad1\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Mike\n<br>As normal I'll photo all steps of that I do on the headlining and all the inner trimming stuff ...... Again it may not be the correct way to do it but its the way I'm doing / making it ...... Markp styley ....... So if the pics help I really please as that's what this thread is all about .... How a non pro goes about restoring an unloved splity in his man cave on his own ...... I've only called on help from friend a few times ...... Once to fit the long side panel .... ( cheers moody ) and the second time was to roll Gerry over and that was some lads from work with big arms \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So again guys cheers for comments they all keep me going and pushing to get this fella finished \n<br>\n<br>Laters \n<br>\n<br>Mark",
