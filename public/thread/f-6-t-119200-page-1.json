    "content" : "Firstly, what you have pictured there are symmetrical lenses not asymmetrical (note also the correct spelling). This is stated in the eBay ad.\n<br> You are correct that in theory they are for pre '60 headlights.\n<br> They are not Beetle ones but correct for Buses. I've had dozens of them after finding a stash in Amsterdam many years ago.\n<br> One advantage to them is that they are suitable for both RHD and LHD Buses whereas on post '60 lenses you have to have the specific lens pattern pertaining to RHD or LHD.",
