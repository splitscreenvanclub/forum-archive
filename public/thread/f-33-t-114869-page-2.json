    "content" : "I know yer having a moan for the sake of it, but I think ye are wrong. Cheque book restorations keep vans alive, keep people in jobs, keep the scene vibrant, and get noobs involved. Some of those noobs will become great home mechanics, some won't. Some will forever ask stupid questions, some will some day answer hard questions. Some will sell their van, some will buy 10 more.\n<br>\n<br>My first van was a bay window that I had professionally restored. I ended up learning how to service it, change brakes, do some basic wiring, etc. My second van was a T25 TDi that I never bothered doing anything with. I left it to the pros. My third and current van is a 61 panel that I intended to do myself but after 2 years sitting in my shed I have just sent it for restoration rather than watch it sit any longer. I intend to know my van inside out and look after it myself, but I don't have the time or space or probably skill to do a full resto.\n<br>\n<br>Everyone to their own etc.",
