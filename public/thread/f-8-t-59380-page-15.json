    "content" : "Well I thought I'd give you a quick update.\n<br>\n<br>Jeff was pretty quick on getting the engine put together and Laura has settled into her new home nicely.\n<br>\n<br>I have had a tough time at work lately , main the work life balance was way out (has been for some time) and so I have put it right by going part time.\n<br>Aswell as the want to get Laura done there was also the fact that I sold my flat and bought a house with garden AND garage. Up until 3 weeks ago I was hardly there, consequently the back grass in nearly 2 foot high !\n<br>Part time will mean I can have time to do this. (I found myself weeding the front garden at 10pm a few months ago as this was the only time I had. Either that or it didn't get done).\n<br>\n<br>So any way.\n<br>\n<br>I am now slowly making progress on Lauras OG interior.\n<br>\n<br>I am trying to keep as much of it as I possibly can but some bits are just so rotten theyre not much more than dust.\n<br>\n<br>Lots of pics coming soon.\n<br>\n<br>J",

    "content" : "so I got a load of stuff back from my barn and into my garage, remade the metal shelving units and started tidying up but after a couple of goes at it I wanted to get Laura's interior started and to put back together.\n<br>\n<br>The OG interior, some of it , is REALLY fragile and has got knocked about and broken ( more later ) and the longer I leave it out and getting moved about , the more likely damage will result.\n<br>\n<br>So 1st I wanted to replace the long panel, \n<br>\n<br>I made this a long while ago. If I'm totally honest with you , it's not as good as I make them now. \n<br>\n<br>Here's the thing, I can be a real perfectionist. The stuff I make I like to be spot on. I want a good reputation and want people who buy my stuff to recommend me. \n<br>Laura is an old hippy van, and in BJ1's words. \" if you over restore her you'll lose the character\" . So this long panel that isn't the best and has a water stain from the leaky window is perfect for Laura.\n<br>\n<br>I started in the corner where it won't be seen with a 50/50 mix of the 2 stains, this was too light - you can see the 1st attempt around the to grain rings in the 1st photo.\n<br>I then added a bit more dark, more of which you can see out side of teh 2 grain rings in the 1st photo and all the 2nd photo.\n<br>More Dark was needed and this time I was happy - 3rd photo.\n<br>\n<br>I then stained the whole panel , but when I cam back to the prt where I started and over lapped the stain got really quite dark. It's a bit of a mistake , but this is where the seat behind the bulk head will be with a cushion on top so won't really be seen, and even if it is, it's a hippy bus \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br>\n<br>and as you can see next to an OG piece ( which I'm not sure I can save \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" alt=\":-(\" title=\"Sad\"> ) it looks the part\n<br>\n<br>All in all I was pleased with how thing had gone and it got me ready to tackle the next job of getting the main components out of the \"2nd\" barn, \n<br>\n<br>and this I knew was going to be GRIM \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8062&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8062&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 222.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 222.jpg (55.89 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8063&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8063&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 223.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 223.jpg (53.51 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8064&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8064&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 224.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 224.jpg (64.67 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8065&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8065&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 225.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 225.jpg (73.46 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8066&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8066&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 226.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 226.jpg (86.68 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=8067&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=8067&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 236.jpg\" title=\"pics from Huawei to june 2015 236.jpg (70.8 KiB) Viewed 200 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
