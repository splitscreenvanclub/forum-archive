    "content" : "Gorgeous and useable 1964 VW Split Screen Camper for sale. \n<br>\n<br>I have owned 'Olive' since 2006 when I bought her from a family in Rotherham. Since then she has been sympathetically treated and completed multiple road trips across France. I am now selling as I find I am not using her as much as she deserves and I hope someone else can have adventures and fun in her. \n<br>\n<br>I am looking for Â£29,500 or near offers\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010077.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010077.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>'Olive' left the factory in 1964 and at that time was a LHD microbus painted Velvet Green with Blau-Weiss top colour. She moved around a bit before I was fortunate enough to buy her. Upon getting her I replaced the interior, fitting her with a 3/4 \"rock and roll\" bed and a custom made interior made from quality birch ply. She has curtains and cushions trimmed in matching check material, and I use a SilverScreen over the cab area to avoid having curtains flapping around there!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010058.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010058.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010061.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010061.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>In 2008 she went into a local body shop and had several panels replaced with what were (at the time) the best quality replacements available ('green' panels). This included a new sill below the side doors, replacement rear wheel arch sections and a replacement right hand front wheel arch. All panels were injected with wax at this time, and the quality of the work is superb - you really wouldn't know any work had been done! At the same time as the bodywork was done I had the windscreens out and these were replaced with heated screens (though I never wired them up as she has not been used in cold weather!). \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010078.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010078.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010087.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010087.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>She was lowered from 2007, with T2D drop spindles and a 2 spline drop on the rear torsion arms. I fitted the essential steering box guard and drove her like this until 2014.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/IMG_2339.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/IMG_2339.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>At that point I put her into Type 2 Detectives with the brief to return her to stock height by fitting brand new parts where required. She was also fitted with new commercial spec Michelin tyres at this time and these are still in close to as-new condition. She is now more or less as she left the factory externally, deviations being limited to powder coated wheels, bumpers and hub caps though even these are in colours as close as I could get to original!\n<br>\n<br>She is fitted with a CD player with an auxiliary input so you can plug your phone in, has a few nice accessories including a Aircooled Accessories chrome cupholder and chrome doorhandles (not fitted). The CD player is slung under the dash so the dash itself remains uncut with the original blanking plate still fitted\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/P6010073.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/P6010073.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Importantly she is fitted with a firetec extinguisher system, had the fuel lines replaced in 2014 by T2D.\n<br>\n<br>Some history: \n<br>\n<br>'Olive' was originally sold to a Mr Johann Rosner, delivery being completed on 23rd October 1964, 'Olive' spent her first years in Jois, Austria. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/FullSizeRender-3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/FullSizeRender-3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>In 1973, at 100,315km her original engine was replaced with a factory 1500 SP, this and her early history are supported by extensive original documentation. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s59.photobucket.com/user/jmcc500/media/Olive/FullSizeRender-2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i59.photobucket.com/albums/g311/jmcc500/Olive/FullSizeRender-2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Over the years Olive slowly headed West, finding herself at BBT in Belgium before making the crossing to UK shores in 2003 when she was first registered in the UK by Mr Luke Theochari of Terry's Beetle Services. As mentioned, by the time I found her she had made her way to Rotherham, and I well remember collecting her from there with some trepidation at the thought of a drive back to Brighton! She ran faultlessly and has done so ever since, the only issues in 10 years being a failed clutch cable and the dynamo bushes losing contact in Northern France (fixed with a tap from a spanner!).\n<br>\n<br>She comes with a useful set of spares including a complete spare set of original 14\" wheels, various ignition components, clutch and accelerator cables and fanbelts. I also have a brand new 123 electronic ignition system which is not yet fitted but can be if required. Olive will come with 12 month's MoT and the spares. \n<br>\n<br>I hope to find her a good home and am in no rush to sell as she is also a great investment! Please PM me if interested, I can arrange viewings in Sussex area.",
