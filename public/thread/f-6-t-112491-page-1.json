The top mount using the M12 bolt is fine but the bottom mounting that fits on the stud with the shoulder appears to be too small. It could probably be beaten on but surely it should be able to push on? And does there need to be a spring washer before it goes on then one on the other side before the nut?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Duncan",
