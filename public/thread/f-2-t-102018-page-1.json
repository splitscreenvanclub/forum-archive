The costs were about 100k hence it did not get any further. That's a huge number of panels you need to sell to earn that back. Probably more realistic to find someone who can hand make one",

But this is just the very bottom of the door. The bottom of the upper section is a rotted away on mine and I can't see anyone doing a section for that. How does one repair that part short of fabricating a piece up from scratch!\n<br>Steve",
