    "content" : "I have recently been contacted by the family of Julian Collinge with the tragic news that he passed away in early August this year at the age of only 45 years. Julian, who lived in Leicester and was known as Monkey Knuts on here, was a long standing club member for many years. His van was his pride and joy and he spent a long time bringing it up to an incredible standard. The link is to his build thread which I would highly recommend you take the time to read. \n<br> \n<br> I don't know any details but I understand Julian took his own life. It's more than a little ironic that I am writing this on World Suicide Prevention Day and the clubs charity this year is CALM, the charity involved in preventing young men committing suicide.\n<br> \n<br> I am still in regular contact with Julian's family as he mentioned in his will that the family should ask the club for help with the sale of the van. I will be acting as a point of contact when the time comes. \n<br> \n<br> Julian's family have access to this forum and I will be sending them the link to this thread. Any messages of condolence that you should wish to post will be read though they can't reply directly I will post or pm any responses from them.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=83572\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=83572</a>",
