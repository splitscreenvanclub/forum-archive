I'd like to be able to get up to 60-70 fairly quickly and stay there all day. \n<br>\n<br>I've got the books but so many options have me going in circles. I've friends in the states for the kit so looking for advice on what others are running. I intend to do this myself with a little technical info from a local classic restoration company. \n<br>\n<br>Grant",
