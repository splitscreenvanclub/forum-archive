Arriving next morning to the \n<span class=\"posthilit\">french</span> port we filled up with petrol and set of in the direction of La Rochelle. With the windows open and tunes on the radio we were all in good spirits. Just south of Nantes this happened.....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/97c310f0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>BOSH !\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/046.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>A stone had flown up from a truck and smashed our safari window\n<br>\n<br>We were devastated because we thought our holiday was ruined ! Where were we going to get glass for Vera ?\n<br>\n<br>We rang RH insurance and got recovered to a nearby Citroen garage - they rang VW in France to try and get some glass but to no avail....we got put up in a Hotel for free by RH insurance (top guys ! ) \n<br>\n<br>I honestly didnt know what to do at this stage ....\n<br>\n<br>So...we found an internet cafe and posted up on here for help - we quickly received responses from Jayfor, Paul_F and Grant - all suggesting plexiglass from a DIY merchant and some duck tape to secure it to the frame of the window !!! Genius ....many thanks guys you saved our holiday !\n<br>\n<br>We quickly sourced the plexiglass - Jayfor said Bricomart was the \n<span class=\"posthilit\">french</span> version of B&amp;Q..good man !\n<br>\n<br>Next day we were on our way and having missed out La Rochelle we got the ferry from Royan across the bay...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/047.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We arrived at our first booked camp site in Lacanau\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/056.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/054.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Surf board hire shop...pick a board any board !\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/067.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/063.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Ciara was pretty handy with the shovel !\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/069.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The walk to the beach was through a pine forest – free parking – just the job !\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i119.photobucket.com/albums/o160/ooh_bugster/074-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Leaving the beach\n<br>\n<br>On one of the days we spent on the beach we got ourselves orgainzed – we came back to the van and had a warm solar shower to wash the salt and sand off us – popped the cool box and had an ice cold beer and Deb had a glass of cold wine. It didn’t take much to buy some ice for 1 euro from the campsite that morning drop the beers in and a bottle of wine.
