I had the bus out at the weekend and it seems a bit quieter but don't have any door/interior panels fitted yet so it's hard to get a true comparison. I also fitted a thin layer of laminate floor underlay on the cargo floor and rear engine area as I had some in the garage, might be a bit overkill but it's was free so can't complain! I've still to do the front cab area which made a massive difference on my last bus when it was fitted out with silent coat. \n<br> \n<br> Think I've spent around £150 on materials.",

    "content" : "[amazing thread, guys!]\n<br> \n<br> My personal summary for the thread is further below, but I have a new question plus an old one - just to be sure:\n<br> \n<br> Q1: If I was considering in the nearish future a bare-metal respray and hence sandblasting, how easy does the flashing come off? Should I even be concerned about the inside?\n<br> \n<br> Q2: Are you absolutely sure the tape doesn't smell on the engine bay? Mine does get rather toasty when the engine has been running at 100ish degrees for a couple of hours on a long run!\n<br> \n<br> I've studied this thread and come to the same obvious conclusions that my van needs to be BOTH sound-deadened AND insulated using 2 different methods.\n<br> \n<br> I'm therefore a believer of the Screwfix 'flashing tape' method, doubling-up different widths over the engine and floor - using a tough roller. (Still checking the Aquaseal brand for the roof, though) For insulation, I didn't fancy using e.g. a batten framework around a dense foam mat for insulation and so instead I am instead opting for a 'double insulation' shiny-sheet-type product that can be used everywhere - including over the windows if I chop it about neatly:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.screwfix.com/p/airtec-double-insulation-1-5-x-25m/50913\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.screwfix.com/p/airtec-double ... -25m/50913</a> \n<br> \n<br> (The above covers a massive 37.5m2 has a medium insulation score and beats the other Screwfix products by double - Thermawrap or Super quilt - in terms of cost/m2/insulation efficiency)\n<br> \n<br> Sound deadening paint seemed a little too variable in terms of depth and also a bit messy &amp; irreversible? The cab doors, cab roof, under the front seats PLUS on the cab floor seemed like a good idea to do as well. I couldn't see a reason NOT to do the cab floor since it doesn't need welding unless someone has fallen down a potential unforeseen trap?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers - Craig\n<br> \n<br> ___________________________________________\n<br> Here's a list of most of the live links previously mentioned with some extra updated info whilst I researched them:\n<br> \n<br> * \n<a href=\"http://www.screwfix.com/p/flashing-tape-100mm-x-10m/94496\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.screwfix.com/p/flashing-tape ... -10m/94496</a> (larger width) 100mmx10m £11.59; 150mmx10m £16.29; 225mmx10m £22.99; \n<br> * \n<a href=\"http://www.toolstation.com/shop/p97581\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.toolstation.com/shop/p97581</a> Evo-Stik Flashband 100mm x 10m £8.10; 150mm x 10m £10.54; 225mm x 10m £16.32; \n<br> * \n<a href=\"http://www.screwfix.com/p/thermawrap-loft-insulation-400mm-x-5m/76477\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.screwfix.com/p/thermawrap-lo ... x-5m/76477</a> £9.69\n<br> * \n<a href=\"https://www.sitebox.ltd.uk/aquaseal-hyband-self-adhesive-flashing-tape-lead-look-450mm-ofeb_FBAQFLAS450\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.sitebox.ltd.uk/aquaseal-hyb ...

Not to say that I wouldn't use dynamat if money was no object but I'd need twice as much for the same noise insulating properties. \n<br> \n<br> I reckon Ben's use of flashing tape and celotex is a fantastic combo. That's going to be a pleasure to drive and live in.",
