Something to pass the time while I wait for my V55/5.\n<br>\n<br>It's horrible to use and it needs a lot of elbow grease but there's rarely a substitute for old skool T Cut for colour restoration. IMHO of course. Plus doing it with your hands rather than a machine means you get to check every nook and cranny of the bodywork.\n<br>\n<br>I was brought up on T Cut as my dad was a used car dealer way back when. I thought I'd seen the last of it but I swear by it.\n<br>\n<br>Photos not great as raining today so I was in the confines of the garage but she's coming along. A good polish will follow the T Cut.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08/24/85a8636a91b309748ead2eac6d0cab8a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08/24/87cc37dd0603458e67d5b667a10a1a9c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08/24/fdc6dc255cf2e9963bb3f7dea4b5d0cf.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/08/24/ab4d7440f07876faee871736135d1e66.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
