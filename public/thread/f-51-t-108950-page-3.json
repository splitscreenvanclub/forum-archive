Your timed requirement for sale will dictate the price I guess..\n  <br>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Ben I priced this old bus to sell fast at £68k I'm surprised its still here for sale, You have no idea the amount of interest I have had but they all include taking something in part exchange, If I take something in part exchange I want it to be something I am happy to keep for a year or two. All the stuff I have been offered I would just want to stick straight back on the market and I cant be bothered with that. I have had no only cash offers but plenty of folks have told me they are trying to get the cash together also had lots of folk just want to waist my time by saying can I take a pic of this or that and then just disappear probably to go and waste someone else's time. There is barndoor projects on the market at the moment in the same ball park price wise as my panel and the 1950 kombi I swapped to get my hands on this bus is up for £80k, Granted Dai the owner/seller had a few quid to sink into it to make it road worthy. It wont be sat here for too long before it starts to look like a bargain and if I get attached again over the summer I may pull this advert and relist it this time next year for £80k, I know of barndoor busses out there that have changed hands under the radar for $250,000 and I still rate my panel as something just as special. I keep spotting bay window campers up for sale at £30k + and 21 window splits at £60k +, There is thousands of those buses out there so if you are looking for something seriously rare as just a good investment or a great base to something a little different this panel should look like a steal \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
