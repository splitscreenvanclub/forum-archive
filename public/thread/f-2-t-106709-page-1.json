I think his max height was 68\" but you'd need to check. His trailer is quite low and also tilts down to extremely lowered vehicles aren't a problem. His name is peter and his number is 07770 343313. He was very reasonable and if you have both postcodes should be able to give you a price over the phone. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
