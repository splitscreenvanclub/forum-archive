Maybe test the market with some chrome and some bare metal that people can paint or anodise or whatever they chose. I say go chrome as custom Devon interiors with anything other than stick don't seem to be out there... Just my 2 penneth. Dave\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
