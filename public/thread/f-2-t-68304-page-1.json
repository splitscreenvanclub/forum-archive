    "content" : "I don't recall there ever being a thread on this subject, so I thought I'd start one. \n<br>\n<br>I'm a bit of a buffer (you know the type; pipe, slippers, mug of cocoa), and one subject that really intrigues me is the early days of VW Motors Ltd. (GB). The subject has been so poorly documented and finding information on it is very difficult. \n<br>\n<br>The company Volkswagen Motors Ltd. was founded in London in January 1953 and the first 'official' VWs arrived in London in June 1953. (Before the founding of VW Motors, 3 RHD Beetles had been ordered for UK delivery in 1952- one of these still survives today). A total of 945 VWs were delivered to VW Motors in 1953. 944 of these were RHD Beetles, only 1 was a RHD Type 2. The factory was not yet tooled-up for the volume production of RHD buses, but they could be manufactured to order. Here’s an original VW Motors price list from September ’53…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://home.btconnect.com/oakley-web/tn_953pricelist.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Buses weren’t officially available to the British public.\n<br>\n<br>For the UK, that all changed some time around April 1954 when Buses were added to the UK pricelist…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://home.btconnect.com/oakley-web/tn_654pricelist.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>…and in 1954, VW Motors UK sold 786 Type2s.\n<br>\n<br>For 1955, I don’t know the exact figures for UK RHD Barndoor sales, but it’s in the region of 300.\n<br>\n<br>Therefore, in total approx. 1100 RHD Barndoors were sold in the UK. \n<br>\n<br>So this brings me to the questions. How much remaining information is there out there of UK supplied RHD Barndoors? Over the years, I’ve seen very few photos, stories etc, but I’ll list all the evidence I can think of below.\n<br>\n<br>The survivors:\n<br>\n<br>AVX. Ex-Chris Clarke.

In 1953 when the first batches of Beetles arrived in Harwich, for the first few months they were parked up over-night in local railway yards. 75% of these cars got vandalised here due to anti-German feelings, some of them quite badly and had to be repaired before sale. VW had to rent secure storage for them shortly after.\n<br>\n<br>2) There were servere import restrictions in place on vehicles in the UK. Until 1952 when these restrictions were relaxed, very few imported cars had entered the country. The UK motor manufacturing industry was strong and could fulfil domestic demand for small cars as well as supplying a large proportion of its cars to foreign markets, hence earning much needed ££.\n<br>\n<br>3) It was always going to be a difficult challenge to sell a new 'brand' of non-British small car to a nation that specialised in manufacturing small cars and already offered a wide choice in this market. \n<br>\n<br>The complications of creating enough demand for 'RHD' versions also complicated things.",
