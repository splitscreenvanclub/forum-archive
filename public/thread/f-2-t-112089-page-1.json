Long waiting list and someone told me he might have taken a break. \n<br>\n<br>Quality is excellent though from those I've seen. \n<br>\n<br>Pretty sure he'll only do pre-59 curved cupboard ones now. More expensive version as more real wood, more finishing and the curve is labour intensive. \n<br>\n<br>Later ones have more ply laminates and Formica so less wood and less French polishing too. I seem to remember Kev did them for about £1k cheaper when he was doing them. \n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps.",
