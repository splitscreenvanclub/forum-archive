    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>yes you can run a microwave, though some inverters don't like it. At a rough guess you would need a 2000w inverter and I would say on paper your battery would last about an hour, in reality it is probably half that as you don't want to flatten a leisure battery as it will damage it. \n<br>\n<br>There are some 12v microwaves on eBay, they use about 500w, so your battery would last 1-2 hours max.",

I don't claim to fully understand all of it but as far as I know:\n<br>\n<br>A leisure battery isn't necessarily a deep cycle battery. And a deep cycle battery isn't necessarily a 'true deep cycle' battery. And even a true deep cycle battery will only withstand 80% discharging. And even then it'll still last longer if you keep it above around 50% charge.\n<br>\n<br>A good rule of thumb seems to be that if your battery cost you less than Â£800 then you can't discharge it without killing it. And if it came from Halfords and has a picture of a caravan on the front then you've just paid three times the price to get a big car battery.
