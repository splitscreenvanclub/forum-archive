    "content" : "I have an SO42 with a rather grotty aftermarket turret top canvas, which i would like to replace. So having done a bit of googling I have found a few different suppliers and some very different prices! Does anyone have any recommendations please. I like the look of the Wolfsberg West ones but are they worth double the price of some the others out there? \n<br> Also my current canvas is just roughly stapled to the inside of the poptop , I'm sure thats not how Westfalia would have finished it! how should it be fitted ? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks",
