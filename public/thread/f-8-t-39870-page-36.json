This tank is from a ’72, late bay tanks have extra clearancing at the bottom for the gearbox hanger, early bays don’t have the hanger, so don’t have the clearance…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1312.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…the only real issue you have is the filler pipe, I didn’t want to cut the splittie tank up, and I also wanted the filler neck to be rigid, so it needed bolting down. So I’m using a filler neck from a ’71 bay, but as you can see the angle is all wrong…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1313.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1314.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…to sort the angle I slit the tube almost all the way through, then closed the gap, tacked it, and offered it up. It needed much more than just a slit, I took about 10mm out at the top of the wedge in the end…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1315.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…the neck on the tank needs a very slight adjustment too if you want them in line…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1316.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…nice…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1317.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1318.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…I’m not using the middle breather so sorted that out…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1319.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1320.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…then 2 coats of black smoothrite made it look nicer (well for a petrol tank!)\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1321.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The biggest headache it turns out, was the filler hose, not all hose is fuel resistant, and I didn’t really want to use silicon, by chance I found this at Merlin Motorsport, pukka filler hose \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1322.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…bay filler neck all bolted up…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1323.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…I’m gonna use this breather later, but for now…\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.moler-one.com/bev/1324.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>…and the other has a one way breather valve fitted.
