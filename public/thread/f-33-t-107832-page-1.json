    "content" : "Yes this is a rant because I'm p!ssed off with everything I buy being completely sh!t\n<br>\n<br>Why is it that these days nothing seems to work like it should. \n<br>Everything from sh!t parts that don't fit to \"plug n play\" computer stuff. Nothing actually just \"works\" like it's supposed to. \n<br>I've just been given an I phone that's locked to a particular network so rather than using some moody back street phone shop to unlock it we went via the official route and contacted the network supplier (as Apple say you should) and they unlocked the phone so it \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">should</span> accept any SIMM card. \n<br>Switched it on and no dice - says the phone is locked to xxxxx network. Mate got back in touch and they say plug it in to iTunes and follow the directions. Well why not f*****g tell us that in the first place then \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>So I plug it in and........nothing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>So now download the latest version of iTunes and plug it back in..........and nothing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>Play about with it a bit more, give up and phone an apple store. Speak to someone who may as well be talking a different language as he assumes I know about \"download files\" yadda yadda yadda. I'm sure if I started to explain how to take the twin carbs off of an aircooled engine using technical terminology he wouldn't know what I'm talking about so why is he speaking to me like I have a degree in IT \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>Give up and put the phone down.\n<br>Call the apple store again and ask if I can just come in to the shop and get someone to unlock the phone for me - I have the box, the instructions and even the original purchase receipt. Answer...................No, make an appointment via the \"Apple store Genius Bar\" but they probably can't help as it has to be done by the provider. \n<br>Seriously? You make the f*****g thing! how can you not make it work?\n<br>\n<br>Phone now back in the box and I've given up. \n<br>Why is everything so sh!t and doesn't just work like they tell you it will \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> The service provider said to plug it in to the computer and it will work.

    "content" : "I completely agree. I have worked as a software developer for 20 years.\n<br>\n<br>Things that annoy me are:\n<br>\n<br># \"Clever\" people who design and make the \"stuff\", who are excellent technically, but cannot communicate to save their lives. This includes \"talking\" or (heaven forbid), written.\n<br>\n<br># The retail side end, staffed by people who (mostly) don't have any interest in what they do. They don't care about the customer.\n<br>\n<br># Joe public, who are not savvy with computers, yet do little to learn new things. Often have the attitude, it's all alien to me, I cannot learn new things.\n<br>\n<br># British Joe public complaining. People either say nothing, or blast the hell out of the situation. This doesn't help anyone.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Computers are no different to carbs. You need to learn, practice, ask questions, be curious, and try and help yourself.\n<br>\n<br>None of this is helped by the above.\n<br>\n<br>Some years ago, I was told I should just pay someone to do the maintenance on my van. I didn't take this crap advice.",
