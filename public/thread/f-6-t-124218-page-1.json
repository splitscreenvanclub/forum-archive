    "content" : "Firstly thanks for the ad d - always wanted a SS and picked up a 69 Brazilian in need of some TLC.\n<br> A few “hours” later I’ve removed both Rear Bearing Covers and noted gouge marks and heavy rusting inside the covers themselves. Bottom line is I like to replace both - problem\n<br> Is does anyone actually sell/reproduce them? I’ve tried many of the usual culprits all to no avail so I wonder if there is any nugget suppliers out there? I’m anticipating 69 Split is the same as a 67.\n<br> Any help would be appreciated to get Pedro back on the road. Cheers All (in advance) - and again thanks for add.",
