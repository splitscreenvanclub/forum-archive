It's a shame to hear about these issues, it looks to be a very good product. \n<br> \n<br> Beetleben, I shall let you know what I end up going for. The way I see it, the wagenswest set is £150 cheaper than the CSPs and also uses willwood calipers which are meant to be very good.\n<br> \n<br> VWJim, I had noticed that you stocked the CSP, either way I am looking forward to getting one of your servos installed alongside whichever system I choose. Would you have any comments on how the CSPs fair against the wagenswest set. Would it be accurate to say the WW Willwood calipers will give me better braking power than the CSP calipers??\n<br> \n<br> All comments welcome",
