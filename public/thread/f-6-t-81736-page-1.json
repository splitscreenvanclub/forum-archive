Or can you just have my drums re-drilled to take the new PCD ?\n<br> \n<br> On the rears I have a Karmann Ghia freeway flyer gearbox mated to type 3 rear drums - these are four stud - I then run an adapter at present to convert to wide five to take my current Radar wheels.\n<br> \n<br> Can you buy four stud adapters that will run 5 x 112 wheels ? Or can I get the drums machined ? I seem to recall my Radars fit quite nicely over the castle nut due to the adapters moving the wheels out a little. \n<br> \n<br> All help gratefully appreciated\n<br> \n<br> Regards\n<br> \n<br> Paul",

I know they're available for T1 brakes, but depending on the year, T3 brakes can be larger than some T1 brakes. As long as the Porsche pattern ones are designed for late brakes, they they should fit, but check first.\n<br> \n<br> At the front, I've never tried to find them, but I would be supprised if there are blanks available off the shelf. T2 drum choices aren't as wide as T1's",
