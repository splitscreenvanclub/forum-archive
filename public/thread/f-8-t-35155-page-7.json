It was hard to work out what was keeping it up it had already collapsed once at the front and at the back before they repropped it up and it was resting on the bulkhead upright at the back all the way home but it all held. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC02730.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>You could tell how bad it was as when i tried to get it in the garage by lifting the back on a jack, the torsion beam went up like 5\" before the body started to move and that was the good end \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> . \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>hopefully in the next few weeks i should get to fixing her. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>I cant wait.....thank god at least it doesnt need any paint or a wash - \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>cheers \n<br> \n<br>Mark",
