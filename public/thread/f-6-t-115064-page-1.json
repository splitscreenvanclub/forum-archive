The two sets of complete semi seal light units I bought are for a left hand drive bus which mine is. But will this fail the mot ????? I'm worried the light beams will be pointing in the wrong direction.",

I noticed that there are arrows on the light lenses when fitting and I I have also heard that you can get tape to use on the light lenses to deflect the beam which I don't really want but if it's a quick option to passing the MOT then it will do for short term.",
