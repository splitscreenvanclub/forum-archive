    "content" : "Well here goes after 17 years of ownership!!\n<br> Early January 1956 RHD Double Door Panel Van. Dove Blue.\n<br> Possibly the earliest RHD DD non barndoor registered in the UK.\n<br> Fairly standard exterior, nothing outlandish to mention, deluxe trim on early bumpers.\n<br> Now fitted with dual circuit CSP wide 5 front disc brakes.\n<br> Twin carb engine, just shy of 1800cc.\n<br> Lowering adjustor fitted on front beam but not used, currently stock height on original wheels.\n<br> Extra rear lights attached inside the hatch but they could easily be removed(i wouldn't bother personally).\n<br> Discreet immobiliser fitted for insurance.\n<br> By all accounts a very rare vehicle.\n<br> Price:- Â£30,000.\n<br> \n<br> I'll try and upload some decent pictures when i get a chance although i'd imagine any interested parties would be more keen to see it in the flesh.\n<br> Pm if you need any more information.",

Scroll down and you'll see the \"list\" of pics you drag across (9 at a time is max i think) \n<br> \n<br> get the cursor where you want the pic in the reply box and then click on the luist ( i think it says up load) \n<br> \n<br> Jason",
