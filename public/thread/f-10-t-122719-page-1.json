    "content" : "Hello Everyone\n<br> \n<br> I'm delighted to say I've got the club a stand at The Silverstone Classic. For those of you who aren't too sure what this event is, it's a big one! A classic car show with literally thousands of classic cars all over Silverstone, some of the best historic racing that rivals Goodwood, a shopping village in the infield of Silverstone and music gigs in the evenings on the Friday and Saturday.\n<br> \n<br> Last year Rikki saw Soul II Soul and we saw UB40. So below is going to be some photos of last year's event and a YouTube link with the TV coverage, but the biggie is, that we could join one of the classic car convoys and do a lap of Silverstone.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Y1msRYYFs\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17Y1msRYYFs</a>\n<br> \n<br> All we're doing at this moment, is gauging an interest and numbers. From that we can then hopefully organise club camping etc. My recommendation for the weekend would be to rock up Friday and leave early doors Monday morning after rush hour. \n<br> \n<br> So who's interested?",

It is: CCD00822019 Please note they are zeros and not the letter \"O\". There is a super early bird offer if you book before 31 December. After that there is a normal early bird until the end of March 2019 and from then on, you'll be paying full price. Super early bird for a 3 day weekend is £99 which is for admission for 2 and entry to the infield. Please note that this does not include camping at the Woodlands Campsite. I will be looking into this tomorrow and will let you know how I get on.\n<br> \n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=31990&amp;sid=1070d724378997ff1456cda67c0b16ea&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=31990&amp;t=1&amp;sid=1070d724378997ff1456cda67c0b16ea\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Silverstone.jpg\" title=\"Silverstone.jpg (217.61 KiB) Viewed 3536 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",

This is the closest campsite to the circuit and the campsite is for the general public. So in short, your mates and family can book as per the public and camp no problem but that code is for Split Screen bus only admission to the circuit, not camping. \n<br> \n<br> Also as a completely separate issue, I would love to buy one of your hazard light kits when I meet you there. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers pal\n<br> \n<br> Sam",
