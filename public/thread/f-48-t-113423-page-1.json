    "content" : "Hi CP folks,\n<br>\n<br>Bit of a long shot but does anyone have any CP interior bits that they would consider selling please? If anyone has any surplus items stored etc. Naturally my timing is unfortunate having seen a couple of interiors sell in recent months on fleabay etc.\n<br>\n<br>I'm interested in the seating items (bulkhead bus) bases, backs, lids etc and the mythical table to fit to my latest bus. Had a CP interior in a previous bus and love the simplicity and practicality they offer.\n<br>\n<br>I would consider any non-original items that people have made that they no longer need if lucky enough to have replaced with OG items or poor condition items that might serve as a template. \n<br>\n<br>Also Any plans/measurements that people have captured would be useful as I would consider remaking the seating/table arrangement.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Simon",
