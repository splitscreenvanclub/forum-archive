Maybe some kind soul will post you some if you ask here. I'm going to use Marley - marleyflor Plus comes in 2M widths or large 210mm tiles at £100 a box. its pricey but quality. Has a very slight marbling on it that doesn't look cheesy. Marley must have a website somewhere that might send you samples out, they had loads of tasteful colours. roll is £15 a sq M. on a 2M wide roll. \n<br> I'm using FL64 Red Pepper, which looks like sealing wax red, matched with FL55 Ivory. They had a blue or two also.",
