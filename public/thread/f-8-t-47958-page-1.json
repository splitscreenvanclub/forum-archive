(Unfortunately they also felt they needed to convert the rear wheel arches to fit those ridiculous rear wheels and tyres!)\n<br> I found it on Car &amp; Classic website and made an offer I thought would be laughed at. (which was reluctantly accepted! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> )\n<br>\n<br> This was back in mid August 08. (What feels like eternity now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> ) Has anyone else had any dealings with a company called Interglobal Logistics? Seem to be one of the most un-reliable companys i've ever had to deal with! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>\n<br> I should take delivery of it in about 2 weeks time and can't wait. I've had a Beetle for about 10 years now but camping isn't quite the same in that and can't wait for the luxury (compared to a bug) of a campervan.\n<br>\n<br> I also managed to get a Westfalia interior out of a Vanagon thrown in for an extra Â£100. Not sure how much of it i'll use but i'm sure i'll be able to sell whatever I don't (good ol e-bay).\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i455.photobucket.com/albums/qq276/mclarni/DSC00454.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br> That's about where i'm at now. Hoping that it'll turn up in one piece as I bought it so I can begin what I want to do with it. (Put the arches back to how they should be for starters!)\n<br>\n<br> Check out Naher-dran.net (google it and translate page) to see the company I bought it from. Very very helpful people indeed. (unlike interglobal logistics!!)\n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br> Nick.",
