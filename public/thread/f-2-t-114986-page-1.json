    "content" : "My Dad is a bit of a clever old stick and has been filling in some of his spare retirement time making a badcore Radio Flyer and making some similar 'flyers' out of a coca cola tray and an airline canteen tray. Personally I think they are very cool... but I'm biased. Could I ask what other folk out there think? They are not finished and he's only doing it for the love of tinkering (i.e. this is not for an income).\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.actionmailing.co.uk/RatRodFlyer/6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Lee (Reaction) Jackson",

    "content" : "Hi JonnyCJ,\n<br>\n<br>My dad sent me a message to pass on: \n<br>The Cola Flyer and the Monarch Airline Flyer wheels (like he said) just run on bushes straight onto the axle (they are genuine Radio Flyer, and that's how they ran). The actual Radio Flyer will be on go kart bearings running on 17mm Spindles. I'm not sure why he may want bearings though, the speed he's going to be pulling a wagon, 'bushes' are perfectly safe (RF wouldn't take a chance of being sued......), and fitting bearings is a lot more work.\n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps \n<br>Lee",
