    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>Can anyone recommend a company that specialize in T2 interiors preferrably close to either Milton Keynes or Coventry. I have a 1965' Deluxe that needs an interior fit out, incl sound proofing, door cards, headling, R&amp;R bed and the re upholstery of the current 2 rows of seats. Bit of a blank canvas at the moment so very much open to options and willing to work closely with anyone that you may be able to reccommend.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Dave",
