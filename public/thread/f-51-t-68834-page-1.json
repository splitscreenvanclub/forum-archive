    "content" : "Hey all,\n<br>\n<br>Reluctantly I am putting my much loved splitty up for sale! She's a 1966 LHD californian import (imported in the summer of '05), has a full 1 years MOT and Tax (which is free, by the way) and a newly reconditioned engine with around 40-50 miles on it (literally, brand new). Here's the info:\n<br>\n<br>Technical Data:\n<br>\n<br>- 73,200 miles\n<br>\n<br>- Brand New 1.8l Twin Weber engine (built by Laurie Pettitt, if you know this name you'll know what his engines are like, if not, google his name and see what you find! It's all good!)\n<br>\n<br>- Brand New starter motor\n<br>\n<br>- Left-Hand Drive Californian Import (2005)\n<br>\n<br>- Oil Cooler (for those bad traffic situations!)\n<br>\n<br>- Dual-Circuit Brakes (discs on the front, drums on the rear)\n<br>\n<br>- Had a 6-12v full conversion\n<br>\n<br>- Re-Spray sometime between 2000 and 2003 (sorry, no receipts for this as it was done in cali. People I know who are sort of in the know themselves have \"quoted\" me the paint being just under 10 years old, in their opinion).\n<br>\n<br>- Paris Beetle style Rag-Top Sliding Roof, fitted autumn 2008, I can safely say no leaks.\n<br>\n<br>- Barn-Door style side doors (reasonably sought after, or so I've heard)\n<br>\n<br>- Very little rust anywhere on her, the time she spent in Cali she was kept in a shed and only taken to old VDub shows. You'll have to see it to really appreciate it.\n<br>\n<br>- The interior is minimal, I've just started building a new one from stratch, and to be honest I haven't got that far with it when a call came, cut a long story short I'm moving abroad for work, hence the sale \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">\n<br>\n<br>So far its got an 'L'-shaped bench which can be kept or removed depending on what you want to do with her.\n<br>\n<br>As I say this is quite a reluctant sale, she's been used for many trips camping and going to festivals and the like but she now has to go, good homes only please!\n<br>\n<br>Â£15,000\n<br>\n<br>Contact Joe Sparkes at:\n<br>\n<br>02392253834\n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:admin@enter-music.com\">admin@enter-music.com</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",

If you mean that it has cargo doors that open outwards then I`m afraid to tell you that it shares this feature with appox 99% of the other 2 million plus split buses that were produced from `50 through `67.",
