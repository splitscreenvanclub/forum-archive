    "content" : "These bullet signal 15's are rare old buses these days, and this project comes in OG swr/bg paint. It's rusty but untouched and is a patina lovers dream, or a nice candidate for a full restoration. The worst parts of this bus are the bits that always need replacing anyway, and yes that paint does polish up a treat \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=6674&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=6674&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"DSCN0995 (Small).JPG\" title=\"DSCN0995 (Small).JPG (93.13 KiB) Viewed 3121 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=6675&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=6675&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"DSCN0997 (Small).JPG\" title=\"DSCN0997 (Small).JPG (90.08 KiB) Viewed 3121 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=6676&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=6676&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"DSCN0998 (Small).JPG\" title=\"DSCN0998 (Small).JPG (88.4 KiB) Viewed 3121 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>- USA bus with VIN plate &amp; m-code plate still in place. Comes with a DVLA recognised dating letter &amp; is custom cleared &amp; on the NOVA system already so easy to register.\n<br>- OG paint with lots of patina.\n<br>- 6 OG pop-outs. All side window recesses look good.\n<br>- nice solid roof ......... some minor work required on edges as pics but generally very good.\n<br>- body mostly nice and solid despite the heavy patina \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> The front screen sections &amp; the rear corners are the worst bits on the body.\n<br>- front chassis section / beam hanger is in good condition, still with OG paint.\n<br>- rear chassis is repairable. Currently separated from the bus in preparation for new centre chassis work but rolled back into place in these photos.\n<br>- bus sits on early beam / small nut box (no nosecone) / 14\" wheels &amp; tyres.\n<br>\n<br>- usual lower 6\" metalwork required all round.\n<br>- all doors &amp; rear hatch needing bottom edge repairs.\n<br>- minor passenger side front panel damage, but I think you'd get most of it out with the shelf &amp; headlight support removed.\n<br>- front cargo floor / bottom of bulkhead area slightly raised (from being lifted with forks at some point I'd guess?). Needs pushing back down but would be an easy fix when repairing the centre chassis.\n<br>- Centre chassis is toast, but isn't it always! Needs the usual chassis repair sections, I-beams, top-hats, etc.\n<br>- rear shelf requires repairs.\n<br>- front &amp; cargo floors need replacing.\n<br> \n<br>What you see in the photos is what you get. Could be a very cool, slammed, gnarly looking 15 window, or is a nice basis for a full restoration of what is a rare and desirable model. There's a bunch more photos here:\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://s1179.photobucket.com/user/busben76/library/60%2015window\">http://s1179.photobucket.com/user/busbe ... 2015window</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br> \n<br>Reduced to £8500. Bus is at DT9 5DA.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for looking.\n<br>\n<br>Ben (07742 408558)",
