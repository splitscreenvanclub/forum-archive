I'm sure if you advise your clients as you did me, that you will do a job right rather than rush it they will be very happy.\n<br>\n<br>Rushing to get something out to a deadline inevitably produces a lower quality result, anyone who tries to push a professional to rush a job doesn't deserve a bus !\n<br>\n<br>The amount of things that can crop up in a resto is enormous. You're doing the right thing by having a waiting list rather than time slots. Look at Bromsgrove Auto Trimmers, they're always fully booked and you take your place in the queue if you want their finish.\n<br>\n<br>Keep up the good work !",
