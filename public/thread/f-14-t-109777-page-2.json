Not.\n<br>I use both FB and the forum but, as previously stated, the FB feed scrolls through quite quickly and then is lost forever. The threads on the forum are built on and each one tells a story. \n<br>\n<br>I think there should be more links on FB to re-direct traffic to this site - perhaps the FB admin could look at setting up posts to go out on an hourly basis suggesting various threads to look at here. This doesn't require someone sitting at FB all day every day thinking of things to write and link to every hour; these posts can be pre-written and set to be published/posted up to a month(?) in advance. I'm sure that the posts can even be programmed to re-post on a never ending cycle. This suggestion, however, would depend on what type of FB page was set up in the first placeâ€¦\n<br>\n<br>As for \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">my</span> age? Well given that my eldest didn't get into his chosen school this week I'm behaving like an irrational 6 year old and will probably have a take-away for tea. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_geek.gif\" alt=\":geek:\" title=\"geek\"> \n<br>\n<br>Looking forward to meeting you all at VF. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
