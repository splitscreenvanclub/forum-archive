    "content" : "I have a cuple of questions. having just done a straight axle convertion on my 66 bus I have fitted an adjuster kit on the front beam to level it out with the help of 165/60 14 tyres. due to budget(not a lot of spare cash) I will probably need to fit dropped spindles at a later date. Can anyone sugest where to get a resonable priced set. One of my problems is that my 66 is running up to 63 front brakes (changed before I purchased the bus)so i dont know what year spindles are fitted. \n<br>My next problem is shocks, I am sure my stock shocks are bottoming out so I need some shorter ones can anyone advise which ones I could use.\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Nigel",

Though if you're running early brakes on a later bus, you're spending far more on brake parts than you need to, as they cost a lot more, as do the link pins etc.\n<br>\n<br>Shocks are probably too long if still using standard ones.

    "content" : "Std wheels have an offset of about 40. Aftermarket wheels have lower offsets and they stick out of the arch more which gives their own odd handling traits as they have more distance to the steering axis and wobbles are fed back into the steering system. If your steelies have higher offset to make the track narrower then their offset must be higher than 40 and therefore the contact patch moves closer to the steering axis or beyond it. This is when you move into negative scrub radius - I think this in itself isn't such a bad thing but if you're on the transition from one to the other (depending on bump/steering angle etc) then I hear it can feel a bit weird.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.speedpedal.com.au/cms/A_108424/title_Steering-Angles-/article.html\">http://www.speedpedal.com.au/cms/A_1084 ... ticle.html</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrub_radius\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrub_radius</a>\n<!-- m -->",
