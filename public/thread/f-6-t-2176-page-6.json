They also have all sorts of additional fixing stuff that you can't buy from the standard retailers. \n<br> \n<br>Such as if you have children and you want to have aircraft style belts they can also supply standard clips (like you have in your regular water drinking car!) that can be detached as apparently they are tested on child seats and are safer. So you can have the best of both worlds. I haven't explained it very well but if you give them a call they explain it much better! \n<br> \n<br>Oh and yes I've got 3 point inertia for driver and passenger and a lapbelt for the dwarf in the middle and in the rear 3, 3 point inertia belts for the rear seat and I'm still trying to figure out how and what to fit for my forward facing 2/3 seat in the middle of my '65 Ambulance............Fixing points are an issue at the mo!",
