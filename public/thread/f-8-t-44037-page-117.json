We noticed the battery wasn't full, so a quick check.... Alternator done for. \n<br>\n<br>GSF for a Bosch Â£126. \n<br>\n<br>So took all apart (alternator, stand, carb linkage, tinware, etc.....) sanded down and painted new one black, fitted it all back. \n<br>\n<br>Went to tighten pulley nut.... SNAP! Alt shaft snapped! Called GSF and they said they'd exchange but couldn't deliver! \n<br>\n<br>So yet again, strip down to get broken one off!\n<br>\n<br>So.... 2hrs later I arrive back at DT with a new Alt. AGAIN!\n<br>\n<br>Sand down, paint black. \n<br>\n<br>Fit all back together again! \n<br>\n<br>I then fit it all back together and as I was spinning the shaft to listen for fan rubbing.... Guess what I saw.....\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The blooming Woodruff key!!! \n<br>\n<br>SO ALL OUT AGAIN TO FIT!!!!\n<br>\n<br>In the mean time Jez is doing the electrics on Sandy, and without a box of magic tricks from Peter Good. Going from uk spec 2 bulbs to US spec one bulbs is near impossible! 3 relays on each side! So we found some retro Landy lights to use as indicators! Pics to follow!\n<br>\n<br>Anyhow, 2nd Alt now painted black and fitted, all back together and see if she fires up and charges! \n<br>\n<br>Charges good... But where the \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> is all that oil coming from? Looked like above the barrell. \n<br>\n<br>Err...... \n<br>\n<br>Ok ok, this is getting a joke! It's now 1am and now the engine has to come out!!!\n<br>\n<br>By this point I didn't know to cry or laugh!\n<br>\n<br>So engine out and strip down. \n<br>\n<br>Turns out the rubber gasket on the base of the oil cooler had somehow moved so oil was pumping out! \n<br>\n<br>So fit new....\n<br>\n<br>It's now 4am! And Jez looking a little miffed!!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i249.photobucket.com/albums/gg224/spikecrewcab/4ce09b75.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So all back in, hitch up trailer and a few tweaks with the electrics and ready to go....\n<br>\n<br>Got in at 5:27am!!!\n<br>\n<br>Words can't express my gratitude towards Jez and Lou, such amazing people and so generous! \n<br>\n<br>Vw's hey!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",
