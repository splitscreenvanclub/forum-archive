    "content" : "Empi GT5 chrome alloy wheels\n<br> \n<br> Looking for £250 for the set.\n<br> \n<br> For VW Type 2 Splitscreen, Beetle or Ghia\n<br> \n<br> 5x 205 stud pattern (PCD)\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> These came off my 1966 Splitscreen, but will fit other models of that period.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> All wheels are straight, and in good condition. The chrome could do with a polish, but still looks great.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> All centre caps are present and correct, with some age related marks to the logos but would scrub up ok.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Tyres are 4 matching Cooper tyres. 185/65/15. Plenty of tread on all of them, although some minor age related cracking on the sidewalls. No punctures or bulges.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Only selling as I have refurbed the original steel wheels on my splitty so no need for them and taking up storage!\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Collection from near manningtree. Can arrange delivery at cost.\n<br> \n<br> Any questions please ask",
