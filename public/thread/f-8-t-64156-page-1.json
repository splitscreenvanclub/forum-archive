    "content" : "I got a little bored last month so I thought a good idea would be to remove the 2332cc motor, completely strip it, sell the 48s I.D.As, The case and the linkage and go and buy a CB hideaway EFi turbo kit.\n<br>I went for the 48mm throttle bodies t3/04 garett hybrid turbo upgrade (up to 450bhp) competition -E manifolds/pressure covers to suit my super flo heads, 55lb injectors with a 52lb turbo map.\n<br>\n<br>It has the loom to suit my MSD 6al but I will need to add the MSD boost retard box and dash control to stop it melting the engine in short terms \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Ive also ditched the billet wastegate for a turbosmart wastegate (which will have a gated boost control on the dash) and a turbosmart BOV (blow off valve) which apparantly are the best on the market.\n<br>I got the wastegate new of Ebay at a steal of half the price and the BOV also but this is used, These are not cheap but they are an essential part of the system.\n<br>\n<br>I need to fab a muffler system for it too as it comes with a straight thru pipe off the turbo.....loud!\n<br>\n<br>The wastegate\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a8/tufty65/turbo1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I removed the fuel tank and flushed it out to make sure it was super clean.Fitted the return fuel valve T piece in place of the original as turbo fuel systems bleed off fuel back to the tank.\n<br>Gave it a spruce up while it was out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a8/tufty65/turbo2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The wiring loom for the EMS, MSD, and all the sensors.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a8/tufty65/turbo4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I fitted the moosive turbo fuel pump and filter today.\n<br>These have a huge 1/2 inch hose connection which will then connect to the fuel rails with smaller 'down step hose', This helps with pressure build I guess.\n<br>The smallest hose will be in the return section of the fuel system after the fuel pressure regulator.",
