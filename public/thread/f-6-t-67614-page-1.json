From memory there's one type of gear oil you shouldn't use as it isn't good for yellow metals which tend to be present in old vehicle gearboxes and one has a 5 in the numbers and one has a 4 but I can't remember which one is good/bad. I had to order mine (comma brand) as its not generally stocked by most shops. I'll have a look when I get home and post it up. \n<br> Shalom, Lee",

Not too sure what the additive is than they put in GL5 but I deffo recall that its not good for our type of 'boxes due to some of the bushes etc being made from yellow metal. That said it'd probably take about a thousand years to do any damage!!! \n<br> Anyhow Matt, hope that helps.

Nowadays they conform to MT-1 standards and therefore do not attack yellow metals. Which is good as most new gearboxes contain yellow metals and GL5 is the most common oil. As I am running a LSD I shall definetly be using the GL-5 due to the EP additives.\n<br> \n<br> If you look around all the sites you sill see that this has been a long running argument. \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=276529&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=gl5&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewto ... l5&amp;start=0</a>\n<br> \n<br> Personally I shall put 2.5 litres of the best oil available for my setup and that is Morris XEP90 GL5",

Was told a while back that early ones had steel forks, but they were change on the later boxes for quieter / smoother operation. Just curious.",
