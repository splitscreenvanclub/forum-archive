A thin oil has a lower number and flows more easily, while thick oils have a higher number and are more resistant to flow. Water has a very low viscosity -- it is thin and flows easily. Honey has a very high viscosity -- it is thick and gooey.\n<br> \n<br> Multi-weight oils (such as 10W-30) are a new invention made possible by adding polymers to oil. The polymers allow the oil to have different weights at different temperatures. The first number indicates the viscosity of the oil at a cold temperature, while the second number indicates the viscosity at operating temperature.\n<br> \n<br> The way I look at it is that when the air cooled engine was invented there was only monograde oils available so they had nothing else. Now we have multigrade it's a far better oil. Afterall we all had black and white TV's in the 60's now we all have colour ones (well most of us) I use Quantum SJ 15/40 from my local VW dealer, £10 for 5 ltr. Plus if you use Morris 30 if you need oil en route to somewhere you're not gonna get it at a petrol station.\n<br> \n<br> OP",

Had to rebuild no end of mower engines cos my late father used boggy mulitgrade in them. \n<br> \n<br> I would advocate the use of any good quality branded modern multigrade mineral oil in your engine. (IE not recycled supermarket stuff, and not synthetic)",
