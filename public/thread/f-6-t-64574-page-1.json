Have you got the devon lifting mechanism? If not you could go down the gas strut route like me...the end result is great but boy did it take some working out and faffing with to get it right....let me know if I can be of any further assistance.",

The lifting frame is spring-loaded so next best this to gas struts without the woosh !!!! I have a picture of a roof removed from a bay. It shows a sheet metal turned up all around the opening. The roof framework has its own rectangular frame that I will bolt to this newly formed sheet metal up stand. I can dress the roof lining to this too.\n<br> \n<br> The bunks don't actually get fixed to the lifting roof, they appear to be fixed to that little internal \"gutter\" that the roof lining would tuck behind, they then hook to a bracket in the middle.\n<br> \n<br> (Hope you can picture what I am saying).\n<br> \n<br> As I proceed I try to post some photos, if I can work out how to do that.....\n<br> \n<br> Anybody know a good Bay Window web site Forum I could ask a few questions on????",

I had a bay devon roof fitted to my split but didn't like the fact it wasn't made for a split so changed it to a canterbury pitt roof.\n<br> re-strengthing the roof cut with box section is the way to go, good luck with the fit and i f you need any 'finished' pics ive got a few of the outside.",
