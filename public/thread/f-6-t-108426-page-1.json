There's a lot of play in the box so I'm planning a rebuild and a raise, don't have any experience with the creative rack but have heard people saying only good things about it but it's not cheap and I can't see why a good condition or Refurbed box sitting a little higher won't do the trick.",

Had a raised box on the last bus and couldn't get to the filler plug to top it up. Rack might be a more expensive option but much easier and you end up with much more positive steering. Raised box means cutting and welding the chassis...pedals got to be trimmed and then reinforced, floors got to be relieved (dented) and the column has to be shortened. Seems like a lot of hacking about....",

Also you can't use the OG horn button. Worst thing for me is the reduced access you have to clutch cable / handbrake cables so maintenance (or clutch cable replacement on the side of the road) becomes harder.",
