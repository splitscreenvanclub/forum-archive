This is necessary as the wheel on the inside of a corner has to turn at a sharper angle than the outer because the radius of the curve is much less (the width of the vehicle in fact). \n<br>Reference to the drawing and photograph of the steering arms will show the very different shapes needed for front and rear rack positioning. \n<br>It is not enough just to swap the steering arms side for side if changing the location of the rack as the angle of the arms must also be changed. \n<br>Of course the same also applies to wheelbase. The steering arms are angled so as to intersect at the rear axle of the donor vehicle. Lessen the wheelbase and they will intersect behind the axle, lengthen the wheelbase and the Intersection will occur in front of the axle. Depending on how great this change in wheelbase has been, some form of adjustment may be needed. In the case of the Vauxhall range (Viva. Victor etc.) these arms are only bolted on so it might be possible by swapping them to get a more accurate angle. \n<br>On some types of spindle/disc combinations the correct Ackermann angle will prove very difficult to obtain as the steering ball joint will hit the disc before the right angle is achieved. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.hotrodphotos.co.uk/Tech%20section/rack-13.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
