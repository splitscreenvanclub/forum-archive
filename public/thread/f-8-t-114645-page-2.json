They will need some work but if you're serious about collecting the right bits in the long term then they're what you want. \n<br>\n<br>As Graham says I've spent five years tracking down every piece to get a complete 62 interior, including four full (but mismatched) interiors which had individual bits I needed. \n<br>\n<br>Lovely bus by the way, going to be a cracker when done. Jason (Splitmaster on here) also has a 62 turkis Devon. He had no interior so he borrowed mine and made an exact copy which won a billion awards and was mag featured, volksworld etc. Check out 'Celtic Woodwork' I think it's his mate's workshop he borrowed to make it and they may make you one for a price?",
