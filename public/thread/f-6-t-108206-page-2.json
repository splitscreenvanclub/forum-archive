    "content" : "Well after looking into them both, GAC Racing who built my engine said that if I was to go for vintage speed then get the 150hp version for better flow (only available through vintage speed speed website not heritage) but he 'thought' the vwspeedshop one would be better still for flow. The only real way to know would be to buy both and rolling road them to see, which obviously I'm not going to do. I don't think there's much between them for a 1776 if you go for the 150 hour version.\n<br>As for access, at least the speed shop one has a horizontal muffler so you can squeeze in, but still easier to take the wheel off.\n<br>My bugpack exhaust is annoying.\n<br>Also to watch out for is that if you go vintage speed extreme lowered where the tail pipe sits together with the exhaust box, you'll have big trouble fitting a tow bar (esp autocraft one) no problems if you get the one where the tail pipe exits to the side.\n<br>\n<br>I'm still undecided but leaning towards vintage speed.\n<br>I'd like to hear the speed shop one running and have a look at Volksworld at how much the vintage speed -heat exchanger one tucks up behind the bumper.",
