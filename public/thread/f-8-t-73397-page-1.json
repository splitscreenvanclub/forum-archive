    "content" : "Well, here we are. I have finally got around to starting my restoration thread. \n<br>\n<br>Back in the summer of 2009 my dad (Andy - driving the van in the pic) and me (Matt - currently 20) decided that we wanted to get a splitty after both having the idea individually. We talked about what we were after and it came about that we both wanted a split (not being fussed on what year) and for it to be a RHD. I was living away from home and it soon became apparent that dad was on to searching out the bus for us! After shortlisting a few right hand buses and much frustration, my dad found a bus in the Isle of Wight. The pictures showed a good looking bus and description seemed to give the impression that it was a bus that was nearly there. So to get things moving dad and a mate from the village treked down to the south coast, jumped on the ferry and on the other side, parted with some dosh for the 67' Van. May I note at this point that I had no idea that dad had decided on the bus and got it, I found out when it was coming home, so of course i made sure that I got back to see the arrival. I was greeted with this....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC00963.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Here we have my \n<span style=\"color: #00BF40\">67' RHD Walkthrough</span>.\n<br>\n<br>It looked great, excitement was high and as a celebration we took it around the block just to see how it ran. It moved. And man was it a good feeling to know that we had our RHD Split!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC00965.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC00962.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

    "content" : "So we got underway in stripping it down. And a lot was revealed! We could tell after the once over that there was more than a few bits which would require a lot of work but then we half expected that. But as we took more and more off we realised that we had basically bought a van which had been dolled up to sell, and most of the repairs were ..... pirate like! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_pirat.gif\" alt=\":pirate:\" title=\"pirate\"> \n<br>\n<br>It was booked in to get dipped at SPL for the week before christmas 2009. So dad borrowed a trailer to get it up there and away the shell went. \n<br>\n<br>Unfortunately after christmas my dad fell ill, we thought it was man flu but the type which he wasn't faking. The day before New Year he went into hospital and got transferred to a hospital with a Rennal Unit. However after a few days and doctors not knowing what it was, he deteriorated and went into ICU. To cut out the details he went up and down for a month but on the 6th Feb 2010 dad's lungs failed and they couldn't do anything for him and died that morning. Which was a shock to all of us! Sorry if all you were just expecting was a resto thread but I want to give the whole picture as best I can. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>Anyway during the time that dad was in hospital, the van had come out from the SPL and as we weren't in a position to collect it, a friend with a lorry went and picked it up and dropped it straight off at the welders. After things started to get moving again in life, I went to see the welder dad had contacted and discuss how it was going to move forward. \n<br>I was the apprentice up until now, however I had now acquired the new role of 'Project Manager', although not having a clue about car restoration at all! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>I asked the welder to get going on what had been discussed and started researching things as fast as my brain could cope. \n<br>The progress seemed slow, and I was getting frustrated (nothing much had particularly been done by July) and started to think of alternatives of where to get the van done. On the up side I saw one of my good friends at the pub and she dropped into the conversation that her dad did a lot of classic car restoration and would be willing to help out. So I jumped at the opportunity. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>After a few phone calls and visits Mark was now recruited onto my restoration team! Yay! We went to see the van and decided to pull it from that welder as it didn't seem to even be ON the to do list \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>\n<br>And here it is arriving back home.......\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC02328.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC02329.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC02332.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/DSC02333.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Yikes.... but was so nice to have it here at home where I could see it!",

    "content" : "So just before Christmas 2010 I had a visit from Mr Dave Haywood to give the van a good butchers, I had been up to the 'Haywoods' workshop a number of times and was very impressed with the work there. I agreed to get it up to him, and on the 5th Feb 2011, the van went up to the workshop to undergo some serious surgery.... luckily in the hands of some good surgeons!
