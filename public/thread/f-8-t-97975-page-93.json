We're wondering about the detail around the lock hole. It made me chuckle that the lock for the hole in the \"rear' has \"BUM\" written on it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1946_zpswplqyqfs.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1946_zpswplqyqfs.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1945_zpsbr9n1zzk.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1945_zpsbr9n1zzk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Please could someone with a narrow hatch rear door tell me if there's a shoulder around the lock hole or not? I can't remember and it's been filled up with filler \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> i.e. does the ferrule sit in an indent or not?

I've had a little rest and I'm off to too a little more.\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

    "content" : "Looking good and smooth mate! What are you using for blocks on the wide panels like the rear hatch and long side? The benefit of having a pro work with you definitely shows, even down to what he's told you regarding different types of filler and when to layer them, awesome advice! \n<br>\n<br>Im using a straight edge to roughly gauge the low spots, any other tricks he's taught you, other than guide coats?\n<br>\n<br>As for the shoulders I think they are present on all of the doors as there is a little rubber seal that sits behind the chrome ring the handle goes through, so I would think theres one on the hatch too, its one of those things you never actually notice until someone asks!! Can you see if the edge of the filler is thicker before you start cutting it back?\n<br>\n<br>Great work as usual, and thanks for going to the effort to keep us thread readers happy with updates, even though you must be suffering with that eye. Keep going dude, paint is on the horizon!! (Sounds ominous but its not supposed to! Bit like a Korean codeword for a new weapon! \"Send the paint over the horizon!\")(Just me then!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/drunken_smilie.gif\" alt=\":drunken:\" title=\"drunken\"> )",
