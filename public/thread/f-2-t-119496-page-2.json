At the moment doesn't even have a cable fitted. I have been looking for another type to fit, ideally in the original speedo pod in my bus. I know smiths do a 120mph digital one that seem to get good feedback but has anyone got a GPS speedo fitted and what sort? Can't seem to find one that will fit straight in without modification. There's loads of different types and sizes on the net but just wondered if anyone had any experience with this.\n </div>\n</blockquote> Not accurate \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> checked mine against gps at serval speeds its only ever 2-3mph out, which is the sam accuacry as my modern golf. If you want it like a NOS speedo send it to Thorsten Schneider, \n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Krautclassicparts-366680363446553/\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.facebook.com/Krautclassicpa ... 363446553/</a>. Why assume because something is old its not accurate, modern stuff is not allway best!",
