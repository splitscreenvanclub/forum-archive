    "content" : "I've got a set of these bearing covers ( picture upload to come) and was wondering how do they seal ?? I fitted a set when performing a straight axle conversion and they started leaking oil through the drive shaft seal. They're not like standard bearing covers as they don't have the end cap where the thick washer locates to press on the spacer to seal the oil in. I've seemed to have gotten around the problem by having a set of standard bearing covers, which didn't fit over the wheel bearings machined where then fitted seemed to have worked. Any ideas where I was going wrong on the bearing covers shown in the pic.",
