    "content" : "Just had an email from GSF offering this discount for the weekend. It may be just me, but since they hived off the classic parts to Veewee.co.uk it has not been easy to find parts at GSF and their discount code doesn't work at Vee Wee, But I have found a way round it , Forgive me if this is common knowledge but it is new to me. \n<br>Find your parts on veewee .co.uk . Note the part number then search by part number on GSF, apply the discount code (SPRING35) and hey presto 35% off! . You can usually get 20% for click and collect at other times , with CC20.\n<br>\n<br>Just thought I would share",
