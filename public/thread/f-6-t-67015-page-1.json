It is assumed that they will be running laden to one degree or another so they will rarely drive with negative camber. In any case the tiny amount of negative camber early commercials run unladen is not at all proportionate like the positive camber achieved from running just one outer spline. to put it into perspective, I have NEVER seen any stock height bus wear its rear tyres unenely due to negative camber. Negative camber keeps the oil at the correct level in the RGB`s, whilst positve allows it to drain back into the centre section. This allows the top outer bearing to run dry a lot of the time.\n<br> \n<br> In my experience, and as a rough guide, One outer spline wears out the bearings at an approx rate of somewhere around 5 to 1. You would expect to get around 100000 miles out of a brand new set of RGB bearings properly maintained for that period. In a bus lowered one spline (with new bearings) you could expect to get approx 20000 miles to a set.\n<br> \n<br> Once they howl - they`re dead. Once they howl the straight cut gears have enough movement to allow them to run slightly off true. The pressure caused by the slanted stub axle rapidly accelerates this process and causes one side of the gears to wear down. This menas they no longer mesh properly and this all adds to the noise levels.\n<br> \n<br> If left howling and unchecked, eventually the bearings come out of the cages and chew up one or both of the gears inside the reduction box. Or due to the gears getting worn on one side thesmall points of the teeth can fracture off.\n<br> This is A) dangerous as the wheel will normally lock up without warning whilst driving and B) will mean complete replacement RGB gears AND bearings will need to be sourced. I have on occasion seen the casing get damaged to but this is not so common.\n<br> \n<br> I have experienced a bus with two outer splines on RGB`s. The bearings lasted just shy of 5000 miles. The bearings were not new, but they made no noise before the bus was lowered.",

Many buses only cover 500 - 1000 miles a year so the fact that yours has been like this for 10 years doesn`t necessarily mean it`s covered loads of miles like this \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> The bearings are all readily available new anyway \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> And you normally get PLENTY of warning before they go anyway. If you change them out as soon as they start to howl then you`re unlikely to ever get any serious problems.\n<br> \n<br> Ever thought of putting you bus back up to stock height? 1 spline lowering is not a lot so you don`t achieved a slammed look anyway. They drive SO SO much nicer stock, suspension is lovely and smooth and you can run higher profile tyres which will give you much better gearing/cruising speed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> The big drawback to buses lowered on RGB`s is that is necessitates running low profile tyres on stock gearing.
