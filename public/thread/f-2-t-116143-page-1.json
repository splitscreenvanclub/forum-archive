In fact it looks quite an easy project.\n<br> Then the price! 30k ?? The American picker Mike says it too much and he'll offer 20k.\n<br> \n<br> Anyone else cry when he walked away from the deal of the century??????",

His usual game plan is to double his money, and quickly, so he doesn't get cash flow problems. This project wouldn't have met those requirements.",
