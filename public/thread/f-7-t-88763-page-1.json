    "content" : "This is my first post to the forum and is a fairly pointless one as a lot of what has happened is my own fault. In 2002 I left my 63 Samba deluxe with a specialist near Colchester for some restoration work. I was moving to Spain and was in no hurry to have it finished. I was thinking up to a year would not be a problem.\n<br>It was finally ready late last year!\n<br>I had delivered it as a bodyshell with the parts in various plastic crates etc. When I collected it with the crates they were a lot emptier than they should have been.\n<br>I lost the following:\n<br>\n<br>Dudley foldaway hob/grill\n<br>Easicool fridge\n<br>All table legs\n<br>Jail bars\n<br>Hubcaps\n<br>Deluxe bumper trim\n<br>Rear bumper\n<br>Original towbar\n<br>Original keys\n<br>Chrome speedo surround\n<br>Bullit indicator surrounds\n<br>Spare wheel\n<br>\n<br>This is what I can see at the moment but as I am just starting to restore the interior and re-fit it I may find more. I know this is all after the event and whats done is done but I wanted to get it off my chest, there I feel so much better.",

I trustrd the guy who owned the business but did not allow for the large turnover of people that worked for him, all of whom would have been fans of the marque.\n<br>The cooker was there a few weeks before I collected the van as I saw it in one of the boxes. Most of the other stuff was there as well although I did not do a complete inventory.\n<br>I reakon it was one person who worked there last year.\n<br>Pictures no, but I have seen a picture of the same model of cooker on this site, green and black foldaway Dudley.\n<br>\n<br>I know I am a prat for leaving it in another country for 9 years and hindsight is a wonderful thing and if I had had the time and the money I would have done things differently.",
