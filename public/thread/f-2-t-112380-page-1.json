The display starts on Saturday morning at approximately 09:30/10:00, I will be there to park you up. Please participate in this club line up if you can as the arena is huge so I have room for lots of buses! There is no particular criteria, just has to be a split screen type 2 .\n<br>\n<br>Sunday is a different story as at the moment the event organisers don't actually know where our display is going to be located! I will inform you all on Saturday or watch this space if you have a smart phone and can get service. Alternatively buzz me on 07802 884 583.\n<br>\n<br>Looking forward to seeing you all\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Rikki.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">(PS please feel free to put a link to this post on the appropriate websites etc).</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRmzYXA8gZBIj9Pxc9WCjteYHrqG_suwXK2XsnZYQnFbdubNMxh\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
