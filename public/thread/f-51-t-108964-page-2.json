Total spend well into the £1000's . Roughly 3/4 months ago 70% of which is for parts... \n<br>\n<br>Yes there are cheaper options out there, I appreciate that, but there are cheaper options for all the buses for sale, just depends at what level you want to enter into..\n<br>\n<br>If your wanting a bus that's had just about everything replaced to give complete peace of mind this bus would be a good contender now, no hidden suprises, everything as it should be, where it should be. \n<br>\n<br>There is a lot to be said for peace of mind... I suppose not de valuing is a strong statement, it will be worth what ever the person has invested into it and believes it's worth as a result of the investment.\n<br>\n<br>Appreciate your comment Maddison. \n<br>\n<br>Regards\n<br>Ben",

    "content" : "I agree totally with your comments, it's difficult balancing the bus value and emotion involved of selling it.. With the different selection out there, rat look, standard un molested, small engine, big engine..etc \n<br>\n<br>I guess I've put it on at a price I feel it's worth to the right person with some negotiation. I do put a value on the work that has been carried out, and most definitely believe I have increased the value of the bus, I'm not however expecting to recoupe all the money spent, the bus is perfect in my eyes in every aspect, mechanically, body work is solid, floors are solid, big powerful engine, fabulous cab, full rock n roll bed neatly upholstered... Literally the van doesn't need anything doing.. Buy, run and enjoy... I do believe because of this it's really worth every penny.. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br>\n<br>I've looked at your panel a few times and it does look stunning, and I can appreciate what it is etc, but it needs to stay as it is, and I would want to make a few changes.. Which would essentially de value it I guess.\n<br>\n<br>As for the work, it's difficult to judge as I have literally zero mechanical knowledge on these things, so you put your trust into company's that do.. And on occasion you pay the privilege to get a certain caliber of work. I'm over the moon with the works carried out and when you see the list, probably 70% is parts... \n<br>\n<br>I get the feeling there are really experienced and knowledgable guys who have been around VW's for quite a few years,This is my first bus and I'm enjoying owning It, I'm probably going to end up keeping it, I just have an urge for a split single or double cab pick up for some reason... \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br>\n<br>Again, I appreciate your comments and feed back..\n<br>\n<br>Regards\n<br>Ben",
