    "content" : "An opportunity to purchase a very original early kombi, only selling as I have the opportunity to purchase something I've been after for years, so only for sale whilst the other bus is still available. Purchased a short while ago from crooky on here.\n<br>£24k ovno.\n<br>\n<br>History\n<br>Bus originally owned by a Rancher in the State of Montana. Wolfgang dove blue Safari windows. You can still make out the original signage on the rear and side of the bus which says 'Lee's Horseshoeing.' She spent the years 1972 to 2012 in a purpose built container shed/barn and I have the photos to show the shed being built around her. 53K Original Miles with great service stickers inside the cab to prove this. Not the original engine. Current engine is a 1200 1958 engine. She is the original 6V system, pulls really well and plods along happily at 50mph.\n<br>\n<br>What jobs have I done to her?\n<br>New wiper arms and blades with the correct Safari window disengagers.\n<br>New Dual Circuit Master Cylinder\n<br>New brake pipes to the front and new brake hoses\n<br>New brake shoes to the front\n<br>New brake wheel cylinders to the front\n<br>New brake pipes inside the hubs\n<br>New shock absorbers front and rear\n<br>4 x brand new 185/65/15 tyres with zero miles\n<br>Refurbed and dropped front spindles with new king pins\n<br>New adjustable track rods with early bay outer ends on the dropped spindles\n<br>New Creative Engineering adjustable spring plates. I have kept the original ones if you would rather return to stock.\n<br>New rear reduction box seal kits fitted\n<br>New reserve fuel tap and cable to be fitted\n<br>Sourced and fitted OG dash grab handle\n<br>Sourced and fited OG horn push\n<br>Sourced and fited OG refurbished hand brake lever and parts from the U.S. In the process of fitting\n<br>Sourced OG cab off side door glass to fit as the present one is cracked\n<br>\n<br>Metal\n<br>Other than the parts mentioned above she is totally original. There is a small patch around 3cm by 3cm on the near side dog leg that you may wish to weld and the short sill under the cargo doors has had a knock. Both of those jobs are totally optional. I will take close up photos. It has never been welded either, has original sills, doglegs, jacking points etc.\n<br>\n<br>Paintwork\n<br>80% original paint with just the rear lower quarter, the bulkhead and front clip having had fresh paint all blended and aged. the paint is a lovely blend of original Dove Blue faded back to the undercoat, and with the signage and faded areas give this bus a character and lovely patina with history.\n<br>\n<br>Mechanically and Electrically\n<br>Still on the 6V system and I wouldn’t change her. All electrics are working well, lights, indicators and brake lights are all good. She starts on the button every time and I have put a brand new battery on her with new clamps so there are no issues there. The engine is nice and clean and pulls really well. There are no issues with the gear box. The braking system is now spot on with the new parts fitted.\n<br>\n<br>Interior\n<br>OG Cab mat. OG front bench seat re-covered. Original door cards with pockets and headlining cards, all interior panels are a lovely maple. The inside is pretty much a blank canvas but she does have a rear bench seat and some cupboards etc. For some reason the original owner decided to spray the cargo area with a turquoise green colour. She needs returning back to the grey unless turquoise is your thing! I've started to remove this and it seems to be coming away lovely, all the door seals and window seals are but one or two door seals.\n<br>\n<br>Originality\n<br>All four crows feet all dated 1/57\n<br>Original steel ribbed bumpers.\n<br>Original pinstripe that has worn in places.\n<br>Sigla glass\n<br>I purchased this as it was the most solid original bus I've seen for many years.\n<br>\n<br>The bus owes me £24k ovno, and am just looking to recoup this.\n<br>Bus is located in Port Talbot South Wales, just off the M4\n<br>I've attached a few pics, if you require more please pm me with your email, thanks Barry.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/b8f46cfc56796d152c4158734a4c5b14.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/f6fcc526aaf7ec26295ed620b72a23b9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/d9a2f36659057dbfcfe99d907e534dca.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/a4d8f88f8d8c569b0f5dd3bd345e3aab.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/2359b74f1c8c49568dd8851b44c948fe.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/e634568962f70c02dd2dd5f9f570d9d4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/a92078af599e621a303193888436e4e1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/53f2f59afd9d82d493909d7d8c29cfce.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/e8846ec441283464c4573fac25eef2d8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160324/255b41bc13ccc3662ba80b823a22d82b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
