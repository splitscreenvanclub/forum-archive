    "content" : "Whilst trying to find a 3 window repair panel (they don't exist by the way and you buy a 4 and enjoy having a spare bit lying in your garage!) I spoke with C&amp;C to ask if they were able to get them through KlassicFab? The answer is now no as they no longer import from KlassicFab and are running down their current stock. I called KlassicFab US and they told me they now have a European distribution arm in Valencia. Sure enough they do and this is the website - \n<a href=\"https://www.klassicfabeurope.com/\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.klassicfabeurope.com/</a>\n<br> Not all of the panels etc from the US site are on the EU site but if you want something from the US site they will get it for you. I ordered 2 cab door frames from the US site on the 22nd May and emailed KF Europe the part numbers and they arrived yesterday. Great communication (they use GLS for courier which took 12 days). \n<br> hope this helps someone out there.",
