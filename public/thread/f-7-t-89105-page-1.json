If its well hidden then there's a good chance that it'll still get to do its job.\n<br>\n<br>But now I'm thinking... When you make the 'stolen' call the tracking company presumably send a command to the tracker to get it to repeatedly broadcast. I'm going to call my tracking company and find out if they can tell if that command gets through. If not what's the procedure? Repeated, regular re-sends?\n<br>\n<br>I'm starting to think that some kind of immobiliser is the way to go.\n<br>\n<br>Horrible news BTW. I hope you get some good news soon.",
