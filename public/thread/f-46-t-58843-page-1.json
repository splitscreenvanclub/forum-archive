I have decided to build my own to as close as I get and this is where I am hoping the SSVC members can help. The bus is a bulkhead model and they would appear to be as rare as rocking horse %#@*. \n<br>\n<br>I am after any interior photos that show the layout well. There are 5 very small photos in one of David Eccles books that show a bulkhead Torvette but too small to see much. Does anyone know the owner of this bus? \n<br>\n<br>It would appear that some of the cabinets are common among a couple of models, I just need better photos to confirm this. Any help or leads would be most appreciated.",
