    "content" : "Drives me soooooo mad!\n<br>\n<br>I drive at 60mph all the time where possible on the motorway, as 6 yrs of the M62 and M1 takes it's toll on you. It's safer, more economical and much more stress free.\n<br>\n<br>I tootle along just faster than the trucks, over take then immediatly go back into the inside lane to let other motorists drive past..... EASY!!!\n<br>\n<br>So why do some stupid idiots drive at 60-70mph in the middle lane when nothing is in the inner lane? Cars start braking, undertaking, overtaking then swerving accross the front to the inside lane to tell them to shift over........ cars doing 80-90mph all backing up on the fast lane as the dumb ass is hogging the middle!! WHY?????? \n<br>\n<br>JUST BLOODY MOVE OVER!!!!!!\n<br>\n<br>Rant over........ till I drive home tonight!",

I ride a motorbike to work on the A13 into London, its a 3 lane road in parts and I have to move across all 3 lanes and back again when I want to overtake. At times I just sit behind these idiots with my full beam on but they still don't move.",
