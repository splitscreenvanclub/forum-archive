    "content" : "Apologies if this has been covered before.\n<br>\n<br>Been without music in my bus for a few years now and got round to getting back in some 6\" speakers into the kick panels.\n<br>\n<br>Thing is I don't want a head unit, happy for a USB/MP3 amp as all my music is on my phone. and don't need a radio.\n<br>\n<br>I don't want anything massive and prefer something that would sit under the dash. Not keen on spending a fortune either, doesn't need to be loud as I like to hear what the bus is doing.\n<br>\n<br>I've bought the £15 amps on ebay from Hong Kong and China but they aren't very good quality.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone running this kind of setup? If so what amp are you running? and is there anything out there small enough to go under the dash, that's good quality?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Deano",

    "content" : "well I had been thinking of using a bluetooth reciever (first trying a cheap one from eBay, about £3.50!!). This bluetooth receiver has a 3.5mm jack plug, and going to connect it to my amp.\n<br>I am worried about interference and low quality conversion. but I know there is a decent bluetooth receiver but it is £35. Going to use a switch under the dash to control the amp and receiver, its a bit low tech, but I had amp wired up to the ignition before and that was a pain, especially when parked up\n<br>The other option I have considered is a mechless head unit, they are pretty cheap these days.",

Flicked it on when starting but could have it separate to the ignition. \n<br>\n<br>I've come across compact brick amps like the Alpine KTP-445U which seem to do what you're after but I couldn't tell you if they're worth the money. \n<br>\n<br>Some like the pioneer equivalent seem to have auto-on features that save needing a switch.",
