(Law of the jungle will be applied when the dark nights set in) \n<br> So yes make it hard as you can, pedal locks, gear shifter locks, electrical cut off and fit a tracker, if they see all the security they will move to an easier target, ironic when the police tell you if I gave em a hiding I'd get in trouble, coupled with them getting nothing but community service and oh you naughty boy. Also added insult that my insurance will likely double on all my cars.\n<br> Rest assured I will get brutal pay back. \n<br> Mark Hopley",
