    "content" : "Doing an \"IRS\" conversion or swing axle will lower the rear of the bus by as much as you like. Normally just swapping in an SA conversion drops the rear about 2.5\" but you can change the level of drop by fitting the springs and springplates in different places to give further adjustment (adjustable spring plates makes the process much easier). Fitting drop spindles drops the front by 2.5\" but the drop is fixed, if you want to go a bit higher or lower then you need to fit adjusters to fine tune it. If you plan to go lower at the front you may need to look at tyre options. If you use alloys (which often stick out more than stock wheels) then you may need a narrowed beam. If you keep stock wheels then you may get away with no change or you could get a lower profile tyre.\n<br>\n<br>I always think I know whats going to happen when I lift / drop / narrow etc but something always catches me out - so its best to just fit everything and get all the opportunities for adjustment!",

    "content" : "I fitted a narrowed beam and dropped spindles earlier in the summer and although the bus looked a lot better the handling went out of the window and the front tyres started rubbing even more than they used to even though the clearance was much greater. The only major difference was that because the beam was narrowed I couldn't refit the anti roll bar. \n<br>\n<br>I chopped 75mm out of the middle of the ARB, then welded it, sleeved it and welded the sleeve. I've just been for a spin - its a different bus!!! Its really planted to the road and doesn't roll at all. There's no rubbing or wallowing and it drives much better (I would say its like a kart but I think that would be pushing it). The only problem is that the welded bar is an MOT fail so I'm going to take it to a blacksmiths and and get a copy made out of one piece of steel.\n<br>\n<br>If you haven't got an anti roll bar and you'd like to improve the handling of your bus I can thoroughly recommend it.",

    "content" : "I'm just about to buy a split that has been irs'd and has a bay front beam. The tyres are 185/55.15 The front suspension seems realy soft and the tyres rub really badly. The shox are new, but don't look special. Also the bus tracks all over the place - feels like bump steer. The steering box looks about 4\" off the ground. There are no signs of any adjusters on the beam - I wonder if someone has \"left out\" a leaf or 2 from the beam to soften/lower it? Ideas please!! I have to make a buying decision a bit quick on this!!!",
