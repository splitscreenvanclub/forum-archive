    "content" : "I had a new (rebuilt) Rancho trans installed in my 67' S042 last year. I am running stock height with reduction boxes and a 1600 dual port single carb set-up. I discussed what was best for my usage plans ( distance driving on freeway and mountain climbs in France ect..) with the guys at Rancho. I told them I wanted a longer 4th gear (freeway flyer) and they said they understood what I wanted. It was installed it all works fine but there just seems to be something missing. I called them yesterday and asked for the tech data from the build and this is what they sent back. \n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\"><br> Stock Rebuilt 002 Bus Trans 5.38 R/P 3.80-2.06-1.26-.82 </strong>\n<br> \n<br> I have read a lot on the web but I am more confused then ever. Could someone here explain exactly what they did and if it right for what I need.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks,\n<br> \n<br> Dan (aka it seems: Bertrand)",

If you hve stock RGB`s a .82 fourth and a 5.35 R+P then the gearng is going to be horrible. Really Really low geared.\n<br> \n<br> Askings for a box built with a taller 4th gear is a big mistake. Makes the bus horrible to drive with a big gap between third and fourth. In any case they (luckily) haven`t built you a box with a taller fourth as the internal gears you have quoted are all stock ratios.\n<br> \n<br> What is not stock is the 5.35 ring gear. Stock is a 4.37. The 5.35 will make the bus LOWER geared than stock, i.e the opposite of what you are trying to achieve.\n<br> \n<br> If you change out the 5.35 R+P for a 4.12 R+P then you will have the \"Freeway Flier\" gearbox that you want. Do not mess with the 1-4th gears themselves if you want a bus that drives nicely. \n<br> \n<br> The 3.88 R+P option would be too high geared for your 1600 motor and wouldn`t work well at all.\n<br> \n<br> I have no idea why they would fit a 5.35 R+P, that`s very strange indeed. The bus must be screaming at 50mph \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br> \n<br> In short \"NO\" they have not built the box you asked for (but that isn`t necessarily a bad thing as changing the 4th gear is a mistake) BUT they haven`t built you any kind of Freeway Flier box either. Luckily it`s not too major to change out the R+P and if you do this and put in a 4.12, then you will have the box you want \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> No idea on the case codes I`m afriad, that`s not my thing.",

I don't live in the Alps. Let's say I want to change over the R and P. Motor out. Trans/axels out. Can they split the trans case to change the gears without removing the axels and reduction boxes? Wish I would have looked into this sooner as the season is almost here. I guess I'll call Rancho tomorrow to ask why the did what they did. There is a really good VW trans guy here who I will contact as well. Any suggestions of trans experts in the UK?",

I also think that Rancho would have strongly advised against changing the fourth gear to a higher gear as this is well known to give an unpleasant driving experience. When Rancho normally do a freeway flier for a bus (and they do a lot of these...)they usually just use stock bus gear ratios and change out the ring gear from the stock 4.37 to either a 4.12 or 3.88 (depending on what your motor will pull). 90% of the time the best choice is the 4.12. \n<br> \n<br> I know this is the regular \"freeway flier\" RGB set up from Rancho - because I have one myself from them! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> I have quoted Pauls post above as he could possbky be onto something - maybe they used the 4.12 ring gear from the beetle box you mentioned?\n<br> \n<br> Also is your bus revving hard at 50mph in fourth? If you have a rev counter, a sat nav for speed and know your tyre size it will be possible to calculate what Ring gear you have fitted in the box without having to remove anything \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
