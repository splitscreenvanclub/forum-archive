    "content" : "Hello there! Today's the day the strip down starts on my 66. I've been looking to get something since dubfreeze 15, watching the samba, eBay etc as the prices continue to rise. After I lost a few buses in the US of A I found this in Graham FBI's garage and did the deal. Nice honest guy. If you head down to see his stock, watch for the speed cameras on the mumbles!\n<br>\n<br>Now the garage junk is sorted ( why do we buy so much stuff and not use it?) the strip down starts later. \n<br>\n<br>Been watching lots of threads on here and look forward to learning the ropes. \n<br>\n<br>For the record my target is Camperjam 17. \n<br>\n<br>Here she is as bought.....\n<br>\n<br>Barn find, not on the road since 1979 when I was 7! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/10/23/6befc21b1d5d278f1b55abe1716cbd52.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/10/23/2cb9fb652f21f33e6630f232211b2e3d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/10/23/a32e607a10c4a6865f5b6e7f6bda1340.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
