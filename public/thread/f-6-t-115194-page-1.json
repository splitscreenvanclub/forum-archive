    "content" : "Don't glue it as it needs to be able to equalise around the frame.\n<br>\n<br>I use copious amounts of spray silicone rubber lubricant (make sure it is appropriate for use with rubber seals as some has petroleum content that can perish seals over time).\n<br>\n<br>Be prepared for some sore finger tips pushing them into location, I also use a plastic trim tool (bojo) to help them over the lip that runs around the inside. Avoid using anything mildly sharp and metallic like a screw driver, as if you nick the rubber it is both unsightly and can be the start of a split. The smooth handle end of a spoon might work well.\n<br>\n<br>Starting at the end where the pivot pin goes through works for me.\n<br>\n<br>Good luck \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">",
