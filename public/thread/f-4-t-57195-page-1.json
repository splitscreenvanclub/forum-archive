THESE ARE NOT STRAIGHT AND I THINK TO BE IN STRIAGHT CONDITION IS UNLIKELY AFTER 40 YEARS.\n<br>\n<br>I HAVE SEEN PANEL BEATERS DO WONDERS ON PANELS MUCH WORSE THAN THESE SO FOR A PROFESSIONAL THESE ARE VERY USEABLE. OR IF YOU WANT THAT ORIGINAL RAT LOOK THESE ARE IDEAL. I WILL GET SOMEONE TO VIEW THE GATES AND VALUE THEM.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/577837.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/577836.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/577838.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The gates are average. No serious rust and very good metal and according to my panel beater with a bit of hard work they can be straightened. I wouldn't say they are candidates for that as new look but will improve to an acceptable standard. Depends how much time you want to spend on them. I understand they are pretty difficult to find in any condition so i would guess these are better than most a sthe truck is in very good condition too 40k klms from new.\n<br>\n<br>Various loops have been welded on to secure a taupauline that would need to be removed if you didn't want them.\n<br>\n<br>What are they worth ?",
