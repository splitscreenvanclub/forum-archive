Fueled up and took a nice leisurely cruise up the A12 sitting at about 60mph quite happily and the sun was shining and I had my Oakleys on and all was well with the world \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>Little Empi stayed asleep right until we pulled up outside Colin's house so he'd had a nice nap and woke up full of beans and in a good mood \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">\n<br>Had a look over their bus and gave them a few pointers of little things to do, nothing major and it's quite a nice bus and seems to have been restored well and the panel work is all good. Little Empi was a bundle of joy and spent most of the time playing with their dog (he loves dogs but isn't going to ever have one as I'm allergic to them and they're far too much work ). He was also crouching down with us and pointing to stuff in the engine bay copying what I was doing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> He even had a little baby chatter as he was pointing to stuff \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Once that was done we headed home and just took another leisurely drive back down the A12 enjoying the sunshine. Another mellow journey without any drama and we arrived home with one stop en-route for a nappy change. Thankfully only a wet nappy, not a pooey one \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>Timed it just right because I'd been home about half an hour and the heavens opened and it chucked it down all night. \n<br>Didn't get any pics as I was driving and Little Empi hasn't quite got the hang of a camera just yet. \n<br>A big thank you to Colin and his family and their dog for being so friendly and Joshua loved playing with the dog and chasing it up the drive. \n<br>\n<br>After a good nights sleep we had a packed day planned for Sunday......\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee",
