I always said I'd now only do the AGM but after talking to the organizers this seems to have the making of a brilliant family show. There will be traders, entertainment, food stalls music and much more. There will be of course a bar in the barn/marquee at pub prices hosting real ales etc.\n<br> For booking and any more information look up VW HANGOUT. Will be looking forward to seeing you at the bar to carry on where we left off at the AGM!\n<br> regards Eddy.",
