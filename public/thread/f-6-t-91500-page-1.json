    "content" : "Hi everyone\n<br> \n<br> Just been in the garage cleaning the inside of my van, 1966 12 volt UK split and was cleaning the metal parcel shelf just by the washer bottle, right of the steering wheel. I dont know if I have caught something whilst cleaning but I have found a blue wire with a brass female push terminal on its end around not connected to anything just hanging around. It is not an add on as it originates from the loom. The part of the loom that goes towards the indicator stalk and headlight dip switch. It comes out of the looms black protective shroud just beneath the steering column securing plate. Ive had a good look under the dash and for the life of me cant see where it might have come from.\n<br> \n<br> I know the clever ones amoungst you will say, just see what not working and the wire will come from there, ive no battery on the van at the moment, dont ask why, its a second tier security thing I do.\n<br> \n<br> Ive looked in all the manuels I have but there all in black and white and dont mention colour.\n<br> \n<br> Is there anywhere on here that shows a detailed colour picture of the wiring in the dash\n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Kevin Bower",
