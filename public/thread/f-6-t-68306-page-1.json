Im only aware of the Hanes book but would be interested to hear if anyone has come across anything good? Someone mentioned an old American 70's vw splitty/bettle book but I forgot the name of it, any one know?\n<br> \n<br> cheers\n<br> Tom",

The one you refer to above is, i think, John Muirs How to keep your VW alive. it covers both bugs and buses; its OK but personally i find his style of writing a little difficult to follow.\n<br> \n<br> one of the better ones i have is a brown book titled VW Transporter Owners Wokshop Manual, its very good.\n<br> \n<br> theres also a CD containing a copy of the Bentley manual available from SSVC club shop for about a tenner. Most people say this is the best one.",
