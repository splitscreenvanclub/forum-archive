    "content" : "Well everything ground to a halt because I wanted to reuse the Flintsone floor but trying to lay very stiff brittle flooring in the winter was not a good idea..\n<br>I pulled it up when stripping the interior....X years ago where X approximates to infinity..\n<br>When I took off the glued on vinyl maybe I was hopefull of reusing it...\n<br>There was a grey mat on top which had been glued on the edges onto stretchers...strips of wood fibre board glued to vinyl with epoxy and glued to the mat..\n<br>It is nice enough and I think the PO was using it to cover the \"stained\" flintstone.\n<br>The flintstone came up OK and I tried to save it..\n<br>Where the aluminium rivets had corroded and swelled due to the alumium catalytically reacting with the steel \"pull\" rod in the rivet centre...and the white oxide had formed...the swelling had forced up the vinyl surface and there was an unnoticeable pattern of brown dots where the surface had worn away over time. I planned to paint these to match with humbrol!\n<br>The width of the vinyl meant it was in a wide strip with a narrow strip towards the front (under the front seat and tall cupboard)\n<br>\n<br>I removed and stored the flintstone but was aware that it was going to be a challenge to relay it...\n<br>Last year I laid it all out and spent ages cleaning the glue off the back and the glue off the front...the fibre pads, the rust staining and the paint..\n<br>Eventually I got it to a reasonable state..\n<br>BUT the vinyl has a sort of laquer/gloss layer and at some time the POs had placed an object which had exuded a solvent..probably engine oil! and the surface over several areas was \"warty\".\n<br>Also the sheet was no longer square...it was affected by shrinkage in some areas..\n<br>An attempt to trim it square was made...an attempt to find patches was made..\n<br>I know it was cold when we tried...but it had shrunk in both dimensions...\n<br>Probably because the action of gluing down had stretched it and the action of removing it had allowed it to relax back to where it wanted to be..\n<br>Anyway glue was applied to sub floor and it was rolled and and weighted down...\n<br>But we had an adverse reaction with the glue...it came out in swellings everywhere and in panic it was removed again!\n<br>\n<br>So on review whilst I did want to use it...I have officially given up.\n<br>In the HOT summer we are going to have I will have a go at letting it flatten out again and go through my cleaning ritual agin so SOMEONE may be able to it use either to patch or lay again..\n<br>\n<br>LESSON ONLY LAY WHEN VERY NICE AND WARM\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>and \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>USE ACRYLIC PRESSURE SENSITIVE GLUE...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>not solvent based...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So I had stalled and wanted to get going again...So Madmatz tiles...were ordered\n<br>Classic Devon colours exactly as in my 1965 Caravette \n<br>Charcoal and Ice kit ordered plus some extra tiles ( for a secret special!!!!!!!!!!!!!)\n<br>\n<br>The kit is very good and Odette was very nice and gentle on how she handled me... Nice to deal with suppliers who are polite, smile down the phone, field my attempts to seek an order of exactly what I wanted..\n<br>Status updates....comms on deliveries and developments and DID exactly what it said on the tin...\n<br>Odette I spoke to you at Stanford Hall and from the first conversation you exuded service and you delivered.\n<br>\n<br>I chose the tile kit including glue and sealer and opted to use (as Devon did) 4mm baltic ply sub floor and the OG division trim which Devon used. Devon just cut the upstand and flattened the alloy down.\n<br>We trimmed it neatly.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway I have to admit my calcs with 4mm ply turned out to be correct..Full tile by the door, full tile by the division and trimmed tile along the long side VW interior panel... Full tile at the Heater tube end..\n<br>\n<br>The Acylic glue is odourless and when tacky sticks well.\n<br>Has open time to allow laying...one tile grain one way the other colour grain the other way!\n<br>It is pressure sensitive glue so rolling over the top develops the bond..\n<br>\n<br>I am really pleased with the results....\n<br>\n<br>Marked out the tile positions and laid out the full tiles...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150309_164845_zpsgoihew2i.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150309_164845_zpsgoihew2i.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Then filed in the cut tiles...to complete the floor..\n<br>Madmatz recommend some 9mm ply flooring but my 64 Devon had 4mm and so I replicated this to keep furniture heights the same...works with the alloy strip by the door and surprise the floor lays with full tiles front to back!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150310_122054_zpso9aqnurs.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150310_122054_zpso9aqnurs.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Hole for easicool tray drain spout... must put a hose on the other end..so the water does not drain on my Devon step\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115632_zpsl1pqd8rh.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115632_zpsl1pqd8rh.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Trial layout of heater tube..\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115639_zpsdfjh45ei.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115639_zpsdfjh45ei.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Squared up and sealed\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115646_zpsrjhpect8.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_115646_zpsrjhpect8.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Cable runs firmed up and P clipped in place...and seat refitted...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_134814%201_zps6h4vdayg.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150311_134814%201_zps6h4vdayg.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>This week end is already planned to fit as much of the interior as I can...after my visit to the opticians to get some glasses...LOL",
