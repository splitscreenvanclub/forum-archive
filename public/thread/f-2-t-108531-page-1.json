The beetle rims are narrower than the bus rims you have on the front and the 195`s will be too wide for them. You`ll firstly need to get a matching set of wheels, all bus type.",

The alt-text says that's the year of manufacture, so they're already three years old? Is that usual - do tyres normally sit that long prior to sale? Might be why they're cheap?",
