    "content" : "Up until a good few years ago would have recomended a place at Hurley (think hurley farms, will check) used to go there loads when was younger and loved the place, quiet, right on the river and short walk into nice little village and only short drive into Henley. However \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> really p****d me off a few years back as were really awkward about my panel van, we were booked in as a camper van but when turned up after a 300 mile drive they said no \"vans\" were allowed on site, pointed out it wasn't your average modern white van and that it did have a camping interior fitted so was actually a camper, still wouldnt have it, apparently it needed (more)windows, cooker fridge etc a rock n roll bed, wardrobe, cupboards table etc didn't count. After a lengthy discusion \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> we were stuck in a corner somewhere out of the way, If I hadn't just had a 6 hour drive I would have told them where to stick it but........\n<br>\n<br>Shame really as had loads of people on site coming over admiring the van etc and there were quite a few \"proper\" campers on there. I havent been back since out of principle and its a long time ago so can't really comment on what it is like now but its(was) a nice site and may be worth a look, if your van is acceptable to them \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\">",
