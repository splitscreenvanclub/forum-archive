Fitted with a 8mm diameter stainless tube to run through the fan housing, replacing the standard throttle tube. Comes supplied with a No 6 stainless self tapper to secure to the fan housing. The fan housing will need a 2.5mm hole drilled into it to attach the bracket (drill bit not supplied).\n<br>\n<br>Delivery times will vary. Please add your name to the list to register your interest.\n<br>\n<br>UK price is £37 each including recorded delivery, EU price is €60 for tracked &amp; signed Airmail \n<strong><span style=\"color: #4080FF\">(Paypal Gift Payment Only Please)</span></strong>\n<br>\n<br>Although these have been tested, I cannot guarantee fit will be 100% due to variations in hole positions &amp; alignment in tin ware. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong><span style=\"color: #BF0000\">Please note: The holes in the tinware need to be in line to keep the tube straight as VW intended.

As I have stated on page one of the thread the holes should ideally be made to be in line to keep the cable pull as straight as possible.\n<br>\n<br>If your tube looks remotely like this - it shouldn't!\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s941.photobucket.com/user/karlos-73/media/Parts/DSC_0381_zps30a7af24.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i941.photobucket.com/albums/ad257/karlos-73/Parts/DSC_0381_zps30a7af24.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I was able to get over this by removing my tube &amp; fitting the original one. Otherwise it would have been engine out to align the holes.\n<br>\n<br>Something else to be aware of. Some engines do not seem to have the rubber flexi conduit fitted between the exit of the cable tube (at the chassis) and the throttle tube at the back of the engine. As far as I'm aware there's no repro version available, but a Beetle conduit will fit - this is fitted to my bus. This piece helps keep the cable in line and clean (photos to follow).\n<br>\n<br>Conduit part \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xProd=11930&amp;xSec=817\">http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xPr ... 0&amp;xSec=817</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>All future units will only use a 4mm grub screw to secure the tube to the body for ease of removal, in case your only option is to use your original tube. The roller pin will also now be held in place with a grub screw from the back, making it easier to be removed if required.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: normal\"><strong><em>NEW PRODUCTS* Short Tube Roller, Block Off/Coil Clamp, 123 Dizzy Clamp, Dellorto Linkage Arms.<br></em></strong></span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Now available is a short tube version for Bergman/Porsche fan kits, come with stainless M4 mounting hardware. £37 inc delivery\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s941.photobucket.com/user/karlos-73/media/Parts/CAD6FF15-9984-492B-9654-54DA5CA48682_zps8v8zvqcc.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i941.photobucket.com/albums/ad257/karlos-73/Parts/CAD6FF15-9984-492B-9654-54DA5CA48682_zps8v8zvqcc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Fuel pump block offs with coil clamp.
