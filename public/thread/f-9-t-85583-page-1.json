We have a good size field as part of our secure property which would be perfect for anyone and there bus to come and stay on sat night (2 June ). We also have a spare bathroom for anyone to use.\n<br>I would ask for RSVP just to keep track of numbers but it's free and we can have a fire and barbeque and fresh eggs in the morning before heading to the show.\n<br>If anyone fancys the idea let me know or call me on 07956 826772.\n<br>Cheers\n<br>Matt",
