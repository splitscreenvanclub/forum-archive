His is fabricated, mine is machined. Hadn't seen his before I started mine, although that's only my word. Any throttle roller is going to consist of 3 major element, the tube, a roller &amp; a mount. It's all about how it works &amp; the quality of the product.\n<br>I have a couple of reputable engine builders using mine version now &amp; as they put it \"the other version is ....\" ( there words not mine)",
