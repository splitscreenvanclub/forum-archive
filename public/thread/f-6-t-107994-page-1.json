    "content" : "Im building a 1776,nearly finished. I have a pair of Dells DRLA 36's to go on with a scat linkage,they came with the longblock engine i bought. Engines all built ,went to fit carbs but can't get them to operate correctly with the linkage,its as tho one operates agaisnt the other,am i missing something here?\n<br> Linkage\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/IMG_20150118_145442_zps321f7ca5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> left carb\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/IMG_20150118_145414_zpsb620b3ba.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> right carb\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/IMG_20150118_145431_zpse46442d6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> Right hand is fine,operates ok when throttle operated,but left hand to operate that the lever would have to be uppermost therefore the rod won't fit as heater outlet in way? New fan housing needed,one with different position heater outlets? Bit confused as to whats wrong \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">",

I havent altered these new ones at all &amp; fella who i got them off ran them for two years no probs,totally confused. Had a mate look at it at the weekend he could'nt suss it,got another looking tonight. Have spoken to eurocarb they said move lever on rhd carb to 5 oclock position it should work,makes it worse!!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",
