    "content" : "OK – so I was tatting around with my van today – fitting a new radio really, but ended up taking out the parcel shelf to gain batter access to a few things, whilst it was out I thought I’d have a go at a minor niggle that been annoying me... my speedo is a bit shabby, and most annoyingly of all - one of the indicator arrow lenses has dropped out inside the speedo, so when indicating you just see white light, and there’s a hole in the face of the speedo where the lens should be…. I’d heard that you have to remove the parcel shelf to get the speedo out – well it certainly makes getting to the two rear screws that hold it in a lot easier! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> So here goes a basic speedo ‘clean-up’ refurb with lots of photo’s – I can’t say in any way this a is a mechanical overhaul – more a wash and brush up – but if you’re wanting to colour code your speedo for example, or just repaint a rusty bezel – this is how you do it.. and its actually pretty easy!\n<br> \n<br> First remove your speedo \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> Mine rattled with the loose lens adrift inside somewhere \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsdb7b64d5.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsdb7b64d5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Here you can see that I have an indicator lens missing, and it’s a bit grubby all round!\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps073c48b6.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps073c48b6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> First using a small!!

SWEET That’s a stroke of luck – but the the observant will notice a big problem – I broke the needle – UH-OH! After taking so much care to only polish one way (the way the needle sweeps) I was just thinking I must tell them to do the same! when I took my mind off for a split sec and went the wrong way – snap!

Just refit to bus to finish.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps8ee15025.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps8ee15025.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> All in I reckon it took two hours to refurb, that includes making a new indicator lens and fixing my self inflicted broken needle!\n<br> You could go the whole hog – remove the needle (They just push on- pull up hard on the black center - but I tried mine and it was v tight, so I left well alone) – if you then remove the two flat headed screws on the inner face - the dial and center beige bezel will come free from the workings for painting etc – it depends how far you want to go….\n<br> \n<br> Hope this was useful \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\">",
