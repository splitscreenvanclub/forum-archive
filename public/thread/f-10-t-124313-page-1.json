Specifically, to October 30th, 31st &amp; 1st November.\n<br> \n<br> We have been closely monitoring and assessing the impact of the latest developments and health advisories, as well as various travel and entry restrictions, and awaiting clear guidance from the UK Government and Public Health England. \n<br> \n<br> We have made this decision as a result of the World Health Organisation’s declaration that COVID-19 is a pandemic, and on taking into account the specific particularities of the event, such as packed live sessions &amp; thousands of test drives.\n<br> \n<br> Robert Llewellyn, Founder of Fully Charged said: \n<br> \n<br> \"We’re very disappointed to have to move the LIVE show due to the unpredictable circumstances unfolding in the UK, and around the world. Clearly, we were really concerned about the close proximity of our audience members in test drives, and in our live theatres. On a positive note, we can say that with seven months until Fully Charged LIVE in the Autumn, there’ll be even more to see and do.”\n<br> \n<br> For those that already have tickets, Fully Charged can confirm that tickets will automatically transfer to the corresponding days in October/November 2020.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/i_C5_gaB_BE\" class=\"bbvideo\" data-bbvideo=\"560,315\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/i_C5_gaB_BE</a>",
