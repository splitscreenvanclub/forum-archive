If you're just itching for a project, which I think you are as you obviously need something to tinker with, why not look at restoring/doing up an early 70's bug instead??? Something like a 71 will still be tax free, parts are cheap and you can get a runner with mot for 2 grand. \n<br>Your bus is a credit to you, you may never find another like it if you sell. \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee",

It certainly worked for me. I restored it, i drive it weekly and i love it. As for the price, it is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Quality camping interiors can be expensive, as I know all too well. \n<br>\n<br>People may well scoff at your 'non German' bus but I just hope those guys all get as much enjoyment from theirs as I get from mine and I am sure you would get from yours. \n<br>\n<br>Not saying, you should have either, just offering an alternative viewpoint and saying stigma shouldn't play a part in the decision.",
