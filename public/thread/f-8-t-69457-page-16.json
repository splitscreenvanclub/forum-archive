I decided to call upon my old friend Alan who is responsible for introducing me to VWs when I was about 18 yrs old. He and his Dad took me along to VW Action at Stoneleigh Showground, Warwickshire back around 1988/89.\n<br>\n<br>Al worked for Webasto a few years ago retrofitting sunroofs in various new and old vehicles and so is handy with trimmy things and glue. He came round to look at my bus and the TMI kit Wednesday. This is what faced him... yuck! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/c0c14823218431aa8a4efa973ede3c85.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>He advised me to pop over to William Marston's upholstery supplies in Birmingham to get some scrim foam and some heat resistant glue to line the roof with before we tackled the headliner. He advised this would add a small amount of insulation but more importantly would prevent condensation staining the headlining in the future. He shot off home and I went straight to get the stuff before they closed for the day.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Yesterday morning I was up early and out glueing the scrim foam to the roof. Already looking better...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/f0757b4ba2c93ed6b6d017363c2f2a07.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/1f4725c8b31da791fafea3f8a5a4e347.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c32/Big-Nige/Resto/e333f3ab26f4893bd4a88cea29c8a4c4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Later in the afternoon, Alan came back around and we started fitting the headliner.
