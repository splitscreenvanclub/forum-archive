If not what solutions have people tried in the past. Many thanks ahead of the responses.",

    "content" : "You could put coilover springs on the shocks?\n<br>\n<br>I've going to use the 911 torsion beam and keep the transmission mounts so I can use the original gearbox and engine as the good lord intended. I'm going to get some 29mm dia torsion bars from pelican to compensate for the extra weight. What diameter are the 944 torsion bars? Are they longer or shorter than split bars?",
