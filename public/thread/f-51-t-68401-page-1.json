I'm in hospital in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I had surgery. And had to stay in hospital at least three weeks.\n<br>The campervan is still for sale, price that I'm asking is £5,500.00. bodywork &amp; mechanical in excellent condition.\n<br>No scratches or any kind of damage. I had a buyer from Durham but his loan was not approved and now the campervan is still for sale. Delivery is already paid and as I explained my buyer couldn't get the loan after I made the arrangements to deliver the campervan, and the delivery company won't refund me, but I am able to deliver the campervan anywhere in United Kingdom. As I'm in hospital due to my health problems I can't do this transaction personally but the transaction will be made through Trans International Cargo for our own safety. If you want to buy it I just need your full name and address so I can open a case. You must know that Trans International Cargo will contact you without any obligation to buy it or fees.\n<br>Cheers\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>MOT Expiry: Jul 2011\n<br>Tax FREE",
