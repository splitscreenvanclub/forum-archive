    "content" : "The first number i.e. 20W is an indication of it's viscosity when cold (very cold!), the 2nd number is an indication when it's hot, 100deg C +\n<br> \n<br> You don't want it too thin when cold, 10W to 20W is fine.\n<br> \n<br> You want it reasonably thick when hot for old air cooled stuff, so 40 - 60. (30 grades probably fine when they left the factory .... not so much now I would imagine)\n<br> \n<br> There is no real need to go down to XW-30 grades, and zero benefit for mono grades, the polymer in the multi grades will help wear prevention etc and maintain a thicker oil film when cold.\n<br> Racers use thin stuff like 0W-20's etc but it's only in the engine for a short amount of time, personally wouldn't recommend it for an engine designed in the 60's.\n<br> \n<br> Zinc content is only one element of wear prevention, there are many other things in an oil which prevent wear. So choose an oil claiming a decent set of specification (back label), ACEA or API and you'll be fine. Something like ACEA A3/B3 or B4 (Avoid the C category ones as they tend to have lower levels of some of the components that would be good in an air cooled engine)\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.oilspecifications.org/acea.php\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.oilspecifications.org/acea.php</a>\n<br> For API specs I would say at least API SL and if you really want a 30 grade oil then avoid SN/SM and stick with SL as there are limits f some of those good things air cooled stuff likes in the 30 grades (for exhaust after treatment compatibility)\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.oilspecifications.org/api_eolcs.php\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.oilspecifications.org/api_eolcs.php</a>\n<br> \n<br> My best advice is always go with a reputable manufacture, one of the big oil marketers, Castrol, Shell, Mobil etc etc as they have a lot of reputation to lose if they get something wrong, so are very unlikely to baffle you with Marketing fluff which isn't supportable.\n<br> Or just go with what someone who you respect (and might actually know about oil) recommends...... It's a complicated subject and not any one right answer I'm afraid.\n<br> \n<br> Hope that helps!\n<br> (I work for one of the big 3 oil marketers in a technical role and normally try to resit getting involved in these threads as there are too many \"experts\" already \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">, I don't claim to be one by the way!)",
