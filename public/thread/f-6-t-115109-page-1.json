Thanks vwgillybilly.\n<br>\n<br>Won't have to pump the kingpins chock full of grease the night before the MOT now.... Lol\n<br>\n<br>And I've got rid of my embarrassingly squealy brakes after the (new last summer) GSF front shoes were ditched with some nice ones from Nigel in club spares, no more squealing ! The GSF ones were just way too hard, you could see the metal in them!\n<br>AND I finally found a front hub oil seal that fits!, which caused the need for new shoes in the first place. The std front hub seal never fitted in the drum, it was loose! Found out when buying some bits for the spindle refit that VWHeritage sell a special oil seal that allows split spindles with bay drums, which is what I must have , the oil seal is 1mm bigger OD - who knew!\n<br>Always thought the drums were like brand new! A PO must have bought some new ones not too long before I had it.\n<br>\n<br>Well you live and learn!",
