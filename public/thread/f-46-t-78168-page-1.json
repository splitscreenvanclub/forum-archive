As it was piled up in the back when I bought the van and the geezer did not know what it was apart from a Devon interior.\n<br>\n<br>Please correct anything I have missed. The white fill in piece of wood is something left over from my kitchen and just by luck it was the correct size as the Devon piece was missing. I hope people find this useful.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>John \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4629.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4630.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4635.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4632.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4633.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4631.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4641.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4637.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4638.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4644.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4648.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4651.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4653.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4651.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1137.photobucket.com/albums/n507/magentacourt/1966%20VW%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_4654.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

Surprisingly it stays there perfectly well and doesn't interfere with the seat comfort. \n<br>According to one of the ex-employees from Sidmouth, the hinged part was intended to live in the bottom of the wardrobe. \n<br>Cheers\n<br>Brian",
