I've used it over the past yrs traveling around Europe and it's very recommendable !\n<br>\n<br>It's mainly stopovers, \"aires\", \"municipals\" and just free spots as well as a few \"cheaper\" campsites, the book tells you whether it has, electricity, showers, toilets, etc and how much it costs if you have to pay!",
