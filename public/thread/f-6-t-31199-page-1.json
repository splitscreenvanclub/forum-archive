I cannot see how you have mounted the reel to the side of the bus or the engine lid bit?? \n<br> \n<br>Any chance you can let me know . And if possible, can you advise me on the best place to buy seat belts from. I see Just campers and VW heritage have loads. It's just getting the right one eh. \n<br> \n<br>As soon as i can do this me and the whole family can take off. Cheers mate hope you have a great summer. \n<br>neil",

    "content" : "Here's my input on this topic: \n<br> \n<br>I couldnt find any belts long enogh to go round a rear facing car seat, having spoken to all the usual suspects (Schofields, Just Kampers) I ended up with some Securon belts from GSF part number 514/30. These can be mounted at an angle which is important if you are going to put the reel bit where I have. The reason I did this was 2 fold, the first was simply that I couldnt find anywhere else to put it thanks to the rock n roll bed, but I'm sure I could remedy that given more time. The main reason though, is that they instantly would be too short again, so its a non starter if you are either very fat, or have rear facing child seats! \n<br> \n<br>Mounted as shown in the photo's below: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b257/orangebus/28082007007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b257/orangebus/28082007008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>I'll get some pics of the car seat in place if anyone wants. \n<br> \n<br>Couldnt get anything like a decent shot of the lower mounts but its fairly easy to work out where they go. \n<br> \n<br>Spreader plates were provided as part of the kit if I remember correctly, you can see where the lining has been pulled away to fit them in the photo's, but I havent had a chance to glue it back in place yet! \n<br> \n<br>Finally, the only problem with those belts I used is that the bit they clip into is like what you would find in the front of a van - ie quite rigid and sticking up, no good for rock n roll beds really, so I used the parts off my lap belts instead, which were also securon. I do think you can buy these separately though. \n<br> \n<br>Any questions just ask, hope the info helps someone out there! It did my head in trying to work out how to get the rear facing seat secure! \n<br> \n<br>Oh, one more thing, top tip pinched from someone else (sorry, cant remember who) which is put some of that non slip rubber stuff under your cushions if they are not fixed to the seat, which would stop them moving from under the baby seat. \n<br> \n<br>I have to be honest I'm not delighted with this as they dont look pretty, but for once I've had to put style under substance and keep the little ones safe \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br>Cheers \n<br>Julian",
