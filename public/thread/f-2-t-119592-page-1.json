    "content" : "Didn't know I could upload direct to SSVC. Is that new and is there a limit?\n<br> \n<br> I upload to The Samba a lot, but it means uploading to more than one location. With Photobucket I was able to configure folders so additions uploaded automatically, then I could just paste the link in to any forum. It also meant one location for all my photos, not just Splitty pictures.\n<br> \n<br> I also collect tuning fork watches and some of the watch forums don't let you host pics on their servers because of the cost of server space, which is why I started using Photobucket in the first place. I guess all those photo links are dead now too.\n<br> \n<br> Maybe Facebook is the answer. I've never been a big fan of FB not least because there were storys about them claiming copyright over your images, but from Googling, it seems that was exaggerated.\n<br> \n<br> I think Photobucket assume free users will be happy with a cloud storage/backup function for photos from now on, but having tried to download my own photos back from PB, I won't be wasting my effort. If I want a cloud backup I'll use Dropbox, Amazon, or the like.",
