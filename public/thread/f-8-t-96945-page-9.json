When did you own it to and from?\n<br>\n<br>The engine is certainly sweet...high compression on all cylinders and actually drove the bus into my garage despite having been say for 4 years. Just needed a tinwear clean and some new rubber bits here and there...\n<br>\n<br>Colour....well that is the great debate. Given the cargo door canopy is red stripes and the front seats are nicely covered in red, which under the grime is is fine condition, I think it's going to be white over red...but what red I don't know...I rather like the red it came to me in tbh!\n<br>\n<br>....a bit boring to do all this work and then paint it the same colour?!\n<br>\n<br>Jon",

The seats where recovered by an old retired classic car upholsterer in Newquay when I was living there. The circle mark is from the steering wheel nut as we heated it up to remove the wheel to get the box reconditioned and it popped off and in typical fashion ended up on the newly cover seats, ggrrrrrr!!!",
