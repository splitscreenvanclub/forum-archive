Are the draws only as wide as the rear hatch and there's nothing in the corners or should there be shaped units or just blanked over to make a flat surface? \n<br> \n<br> Thanks",

One for those without rear cupboard behind rear seat with shallow depth and one for no cupboards full depth.\n<br> Both have shaped pieces to cover holes. If you look at your set of drawers you will see there is a ledge on the side onto which sits a veneered plycover with ring pull to lift up.\n<br> Will add pictures \n<br> G",
