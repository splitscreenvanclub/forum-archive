    "content" : "<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>BBBCVW wrote:</cite>type 4 are great but bloody expensive especially when converting to up right loads of fiddly bits to get right\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Not necessarily. Both Tyler and me can budget under £1000 for one in upright form, including the engine price. Very good for a two liter or so Type 4. I just completed one, using an expensive method, and I'm sure I can do similar for a lot less.\n<br>\n<br>CSP makes a kit to install a Type 4 engine in a Splitty for appx 235 pounds from Machine7. You just need to add a conversion flywheel and bearing (from \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.airtechvw.com\">http://www.airtechvw.com</a>\n<!-- m -->) for about 130 quid and some old Type 1 aircooled parts you probably already have lying around (like fan shroud, fan, dynamo, etc). You can reuse the Type 4 exhaust and a set of old carbs and linkage from an aircooled T25 or a set of used Weber 34ICTs (if your on a budget). A remote oil cooler with hoses for appx 100. Finally, a 25 pound oil dipstick adapter and say 60 quid for a electric fuel pump &amp; regulator.\n<br>\n<br>All the bits are readily available here in the UK.\n<br>\n<br>So that's 540 quid plus the cost of carbs and an engine. If you score a used Type 4 with carbs and exhaust for around 300 quid and you have Type 1 parts in your garage anyway, then the whole budget should be under £1000. A fair bit cheaper than buying a used 1776 Type 1.\n<br>\n<br>Tyler used the Joe Cali way of reusing a lot of Type 1 and stock Type 4 parts. If you're handy with a welder, you can do the same for even cheaper than what I specified above, which is what Tyler did.\n<br>\n<br>Like Rich said, here's my thread detailing my conversion.\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=58018\">viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=58018</a>\n<!-- l -->",
