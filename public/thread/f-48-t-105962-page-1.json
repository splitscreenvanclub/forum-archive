    "content" : "Hiya all. I'm in need of some info on my cooker.\n<br>I bought this about five years ago as we were looking for a door mounted cooker for our RHD bus which I'm restoring. I've had it stored since then and upon having a bit of a move about, I thought I'd have a look at it and its got me thinking that I may have some parts missing.\n<br>As you can see, the whole thing is a square cabinet and doesn't follow the contour of the side door. So the question is, are there some infill strips missing that fasten the unit to the door? Or maybe a fitting frame as the weight of this unit is quite high.\n<br>Its in really nice condition for an early cooker as you can see from the pics. Rikki James will recognize it as we bought it from him at vanfest!\n<br>Thanks in advance for your help.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/007_zpse1e34e23.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/007_zpse1e34e23.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/005_zpsf01324d1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/005_zpsf01324d1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/aircoolsteve/media/006_zpsc7db3851.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c83/aircoolsteve/006_zpsc7db3851.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

Of course, I realise that it goes on the door without the lock knob, I was thinking that maybe I was missing some wood that is the same shape as the curve on the door. After all, it wouldn't fit flat without some kind of infill.\n<br>I've been trawling through the forum, trying to find a pic of a fitted cooker so I could see what it looks like against the door. I found one that looks like the side panels of the carcass is shaped to the door but mine is not shaped, so I look on.",

We really like it and intend to collect as much CP interior as we can find. had to stop restoring the bus for a while due to other commitments but we are on it again now and steaming ahead!\n<br>This cooker is just what we were looking for as we don't want to cook inside the bus. Stinks everything out as far as we are concerned. It will open out into the awning just fine.\n<br>Someone on here must know how these cookers fix to the door. I only need to know if I'm looking for wood that exists, or maybe I've got to make it?",

The cabinet has two rather large screws in the top which screw directly into the door just below where the door card screws are (you should see the holes in the cooker cabinet if you lift the lid up and look near the top ). These screws go through the door card and into the metal of the door. Mine also has a flat bar which screws to the door frame on either side at the bottom of the cabinet and the bottom of the cabinet then screws to this bar. As far as I am aware these are the only things which attach it to the door. When attaching the flat bar to the door you need to be careful that the screws don't catch on the door locking bars that run vertically inside the door. \n<br>Hopefully that explains it all but if not let me know and I will get you some pictures. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Graham - cardboard aided design \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> classic. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.\n<br>\n<br>Edit to add.......you have the more desirable ally cooker unit as well \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",
