    "content" : "I’m looking for some electrical advice as I’m pretty clueless when it comes to electrical!\n<br> \n<br> I have a 62 us bus (project) \n<br> The original loom was pulled out as soon as I picked it up and purchased a Vw loons loom which is now in the bus but only partially connected up.\n<br> I’m converting to 12v but I’m not sure which relays I need? I still have the original 6v relays which I will post photos of below. If anyone could point me in the right direction with a link or part number etc I would be extremely grateful! The new loom has wiring for uk spec rear lights, I’m not sure if that makes much difference but worth mentioning.\n<br> \n<br> Also, my bus has 2 holes in the dash to the right of the clocks and the wiring diagram says it has a hazard switch but there was no switch when it arrived and most people Iv spoken to have said it shouldn’t have a hazard switch? \n<br> \n<br> It’s all very confusing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> As always any help will be greatly appreciated!\n<br> Cheers\n<br> Russ",
