I am wondering if I could improve my performance by fitting roller rockers and if so what ratio &amp; type shoud I go for. Also if you have any other suggestions for a bit more poke without going bigger cc or turbo/supercharger, id love to hear it. thankyou. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_flower.gif\" alt=\":flower:\" title=\"flower\">",
