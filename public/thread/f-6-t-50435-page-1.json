No signs of any oil leaks.\n<br> \n<br> I started it back up straight away and the oil warning light went out and the gauge went back to 25 so I carried on my way home which took about another 10 minutes. The light never came back on.\n<br> \n<br> I have an external filter and its fitted with a 32mm oil pump. No other mods in relation to the oil system. \n<br> Anyone got any ideas as I just don't want to drive it. It may be something simple but I have no idea",

This has the effect of emptying the sump quite quickly of oil. Because you will have windage effect from a bigger crank too, that can cause the 3 and 4 rocker cover to fill up with oil, and leaves nothing for the pump to suck on. We've done a bit of experimenting with deep sumps and open rockers and buckets and the amount of oil flying round and not where it should be is phenomenal.\n<br> Basically the light comes on and the pressure gauge drops because the pump is sucking air when the sump empties, and you get a big fat bubble travelling through the oiling system.\n<br> When the revs drop off the pressure returns to normal as the oil is feeding the pick up tube again and the bubble passes out.\n<br> If this is what the problem is a big deep sump will help you out, as would a smaller oil pump.\n<br> You can buy an oil pump puller that will get it out if you do want to change it.\n<br> \n<br> A breather system may help, or may make it worse by allowing more oil out into the rocker cover and up the breather hose into a catch tank. We sometimes just breath the case and the 1 and 2 rocker cover, with a drain back into the case too.\n<br> There are a few other factors to weigh in though, and I would start with a deep sump if you don't already have one.\n<br> \n<br> This is my best stab in the dark guess at the problem you are having, without seeing the engine, but it is something I have come across before and a possibility you can look into.\n<br> \n<br> Hope that helps a bit\n<br> Ben",
