This causes the carb to constantly ice up (even on hot days...) which in turn makes the motor run like sh1t. I have not ever successfully managed to clear a heavily blocked preheat tube and I`ve tried every method you can possibly think of... Basically if the preheats are blocked solid - the manifold is pretty much dead.\n<br>\n<br>NOS is the way to go if you can find it... I searched for ages about three years ago for a NOS one, eventually found one, paid a lot of ££££ for it but was just relived to have found one!\n<br>\n<br>BEWARE - prior to searching for the NOS one I though I had no other option but to give the repros a go. Bought one, didn`t fit sent it back. Supplied with a replacement, still didn`t fit, sent it back for refund and gave up. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\">",
