    "content" : "[b]** Update** \n<br>\n<br>Now all holidays have finished I really need to look for Patsy to be spending the winter months in a nice warm garage rather than under a fancy breathable cover on my drive. She has motored around 800 miles this summer on various camping trips both in the UK and abroad! I didn't have one cough, one splutter or one trip to the hard shoulder - in short she was amazing. We got upto 70 miles an hour in her no problem on the motorway. I have had a lot of interest and a few tyre kickers but I feel that people would prefer for her to look a million dollars rather than be able to drive reliably. Therefore I have listened to feedback and dropped the price in the hope she will go to a loving home soon.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Here is our 1967 Splitty that we as a family have grown out of - full mechanical refurb in 2013/14 with Johnson Autoworks and runs like a dream - even after 4 months stationary on the drive. Looking to get a T5 (4 berth) for the family so will happily swap to equal value.\n<br>\n<br>Work required - surface rust bubbles to drivers wheel arch and behind front bumper - not terminal and should sand down easily. Widow seals are water tight but will need work in the future (cosmetic mainly). Cosmetic stuff really as all the following was covered off on the refurb......however please be aware that all buses of this age will need work of some description and upkeep.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://youtu.be/Q-zX3DBz-9M\">http://youtu.be/Q-zX3DBz-9M</a>\n<!-- m --> See footage of my bus in real time on the above link.
