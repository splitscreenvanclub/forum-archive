Then I noticed BWA and thought I'd like a good at that!! \n<br> \n<br> My question is what sort of spec is usually needed to get under 18s ?\n<br> \n<br> I know it's all down to engine build etc. But a rough idea would help.\n<br> \n<br> I've yet to test my engine as once I'd built and fitted, found the steering on my bus is shocking so I'm now working on that.\n<br> \n<br> Current engine spec below but have been wondering on ripping it out and upgrading various parts.\n<br> \n<br> It's primarily for road use at weekends etc. But don't mind it running a bit rough at low revs if it makes good power high up. \n<br> \n<br> 90.5 pistons (1955cc)\n<br> 76mm crank\n<br> Engle 110 cam\n<br> 1.25 scathe rockers\n<br> Lightened balanced flywheel \n<br> Twin 40 idf webers \n<br> 009 dizzy",
