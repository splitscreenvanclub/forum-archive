    "content" : "1967 RHD van for sale, has recently had a rebuild and fresh paint. I bought it a year ago, painted in a pastel blue with pearlescent white. I asked the painter to leave the final stage of buffing until I completed the fit out of the interior. It is running well with a 1600 twin carb set up, still on drums and has a sympathetic lower stance. All I have had done in a year is to have the front jacking points fitted and sort out an earthing issue. I have not started on the cabin as I haven't got much free time but I feel that with the right motivated person and a little knowledge it's and easy task. The rear of the van had been fitted out with a weird cabinet/shelving nee rock n roll bed type affair, a waster of valuable space in my mind. I removed it (still have it). The area has been soundproofed and the webasto roof works well.\n<br> I will MOT if the right price is reached. Please feel free to PM me if you are interested. Thanks Nick.\n<br> I have been unable to upload images, please PM me and I'll send interested parties pictures",
