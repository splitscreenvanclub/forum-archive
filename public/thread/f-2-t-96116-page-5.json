I had a sytech regulator on mine and after a nice mellow drive home from Santa pod I started the bus up to pop out again and saw the trail of petrol I was leaving on the floor \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> Had a look and the diaphragm had split and the regulator was spraying fuel all over my nice hot engine. Had this happened whilst I was sat at 70mph on the motorway I probably wouldn't have noticed until it was too late. \n<br>I've since replace the sh!tty sytech one with a fuel king regulator and filter. \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee",
