When I welded it, as the c post position is governed by the width of the new side panel I fitted.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway as a result the cargo doors touched at the bottom and I have been avoiding addressing this problem for about a year, but as paint approached, I had to sort it. After much thinking, I had a brainwave. I used a 3 mm grinding disc to cut just behind the folded lip for about 8 inches, then switched to a 1 mm disc for about 12 inches. Then with that metal removed, I closed the cut on itself, in effect giving a small but not noticeable taper on the width of the bottom of the door...and hey presto....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/c4dbe754eca47bac054051f3d59283b8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/b13284342f631787fe8c5c999bf825c0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/4878d9554527dc2d66705abfb5226d70.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/ef409347629530539ffdd586587a6755.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/72a2742fe1bb2a1f642836ad4db51972.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Not perfect but as good as an amateur such as myself can do.

It's going over to my fencing suppliers warehouse, where his son, a vw nut has built a homemade spray booth within the fencing warehouse, with heater and dust extraction...for me to use free of charge! He will let my body guy work there.. Good to have friends in high places, although I've got to fix his boiler free as payback!\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, I'm off to try and pull apart my rusty window top frames!\n<br>\n<br>Jon",

The locking rods are a snug fit and in any event you will find that after putting the cargo door,seals in you have to give the doors a push to shut them enough to engage the locking pins, and they are tapered so they pull the doors against the seals as you turn the handles, and thusnthismpressure when closed should stop any movement.....\n<br>\n<br>Jon",
