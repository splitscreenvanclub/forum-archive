    "content" : "Hi, \n<br>\n<br>My personal view on this is to stick away from coloured tint as it tends to be low quality film and can dis-colour over time.\n<br>\n<br>My recommendation would be to find a good company who will take all the windows out (or tint before you install the glass) in order to get the tint well within the rubbers.\n<br>\n<br>This is not a job that can be done whilst the glass is in as you WILL have gaps! Everything must be perfectly clean for a good tint job.\n<br>\n<br>Here's a picture of mine with the lightest tint possible, I think it adds a bit of class without looking silly on such an old vehicle.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://lh4.ggpht.com/_emD6NbgKST4/THlypVNxzWI/AAAAAAAAF8w/Zd-rl9mos3Q/s800/DSC00811.JPG\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>To give you an idea... It took me 6 hours to tint my van (all windows), that was removing all the glass, cleaning up, tinting, and re-installation.\n<br>\n<br>I would definitely go for a tint rather than glass, as you have the freedom to change you mind years later with far less cost and a good tint installation will look as good to the untrained eye as glass! \n<br>\n<br>Plus tints offers many other benefits, 99.9% UV protection, Less Glare, Heat reflection (Darker tint = more heat reflection) plus some safety aspects too (glass is held together if broken).\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps with at least one point of view.",
