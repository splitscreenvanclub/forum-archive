    "content" : "Hi, \n<br> Just after some advice.\n<br> A local vw specialist has been working on my bus, when I say working I don't mean everyday all day either.\n<br> Basically after dropping the bus off, the initial inspection that day and us both agreeing what needed doing. It was another two weeks before any work began, after I'd visited various times and noticed not much had happened.\n<br> After an apology by the owner, and assurances, it's now been another two weeks.\n<br> I've taken to turning up unannounced, and recording every piece of work that had been done.\n<br> But it's taken a month to sort the engine which wasn't a rebuild, just check and tighten, and fit new shocks and top mount fittings.\n<br> Then they asked for some cash.\n<br> Which I paid.\n<br> Then things have started to slip again, new carbs delivered, told they'd fit them that day, three days later I turn up, engine not finished still.\n<br> I'm waiting and being patient, but it's now running thin. \n<br> What advice can you guys offer, which is the best direction to go in?\n<br> All advice taken.\n<br> For what it's worth, I've been in or around VW's for 25 odd years, so really no newbie, just that giving the benefit to someone who seems not to be making that much of an effort is seriously frustrating.\n<br> Thanks.",
