I expect they charge a terrific price as well! Check out their work on Facebook\n<br> They do the whole shooting match so you could have it all done in one place if you prefer",

    "content" : "Would definitely recommend both Smiths VW in Cornwall and Spikes in Essex for both the bodywork AND the paint. Two of the best in the business.\n<br> \n<br> It will be an excellent job if you go to either company. They will most likely be booked up for a while but much better to wait and go with someone that is a well proven quantity and has a air tight repuatation.\n<br> \n<br> To be honest, any of the actually decent painters/restorers will not be keen (or actually willing...) to paint over someone elses bodywork repairs, unless they were done by a company they know and trust 100%. Best to get the paint/bodywork done in one place then there can be no \"passing the buck\" later down the line.",
