The photos that Graeme posted earlier are now my screen savers!\n<br>\n<br>Many of us have similar stories to tell, I used to own a Devonette, 100% original everything and I sold it, what was I thinking!! And sadly after it going through a couple of hands, it was re-painted.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5110/5604191057_eff331f378_b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
