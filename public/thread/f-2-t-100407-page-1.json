I just received a call from the guys who are carrying out the resto, that the paint I had made up from a Vehicle paint shop, looks very very very grey. \n<br> \n<br> Now my understanding, is that L87 Should be more creamy looking and not grey. When the paint was mixed, I gave him the paint code, year of vehicle, make and model. \n<br> \n<br> I would assume that something went wrong when they mixed it? The paint is 2K direct gloss. Any ideas if this paint can be rescued? or should look like that? or if I should be entitled to have it exchanged?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers all!!!!!!!",
