    "content" : "Hello,\n<br> \n<br> I am new to the forum, I got my Fleetline last september from SA, it is in generally good condition although I am planning on some major works, I have started with the passenger floor (microbus) which had another skin tacked over the top at some time in it,s life, once removed it revealed a rusty under floor although the chassis &amp; outriggers all appear ok. \n<br> Due to the mismatch of years, post 71 front, 63 side doors on a RHD, pre 63 tailgate, and pre 67 linkpin suspension!!! should I be looking at split screen flooring &amp; does it being RHD cause an issue. \n<br> Also over the engine (rear shelf) a hatch has been cut in with what looks like a variant hatch grafted in (badly) has any one replaced the rear shelf and again what year??? parts.\n<br> Thanks for any advice, I am close enough to just Campers as in Surrey.\n<br> Lee",
