But one part eludes me. I have perused the interenet, no dice. I have e-mailed VW heritage and cool air vw and they have referred me to wolfsburg west but to no avail. Wolfsburg did not have it and has no plans in getting into crafting anything new in that domain. What I would need, are the seals that are to be placed between the cargo door hinges and the car body. Do I have to manufacture them by myself or does anyone have a cristal ball to consult to \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> help in this desperate quest?",
