    "content" : "I've got a VDO oil temperature gauge and sump sender fitted to the van. The system has never worked since I bought the van. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<br> It's eventually got to the top of the 'To Do' list. Last night I checked the + and - to the gauge and they are good. The wire from the gauge to the sender was also checked and it's OK. So it can only be the gauge or the sender. \n<br> Has anyone got a sump sender fitted to their engine? I'd like to know the resistance range of the thermistor inside the sender and whether its a positive temperature coefficient - resistance increases as engine oil temperature increases or a negative temperature coefficient - decreases with temperature. I've tried searching the net, but didn't find anything.\n<br> If you have one fitted and could measure the resistance when the engine is cold and at normal running temperature, it would be greatly appreciated.",

It's a NTC thermistor so resistance decreases as temperature increases. It should read around 36 ohms at 120 degrees. If anyone has got one on their sump plate and can measure the resistance when the engine is cold, it would be helpful.",
