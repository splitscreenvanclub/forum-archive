    "content" : "Due to lack of use and the slowing down of the driver due to the aging process, I reluctantly decided to put my RHD bus up for sale. It was totally restored during 2012/13 with invoices to show. The 1600 engine has been rebuilt by a local Porsche mechanic and has never missed a beat since, nor before for that matter. It has new from Creative Engineering their upgraded steering set up and column, full length roofrack and ladder, safaris and bumpers all in stainless steel. As can be seen in the photo, a new set of 5 wheels and tyres have been fitted. The interior has a full size rock-and-roll bed with re-upholstered cushions. With plenty of storage, the interior is freshly painted in blue and white to match the exterior and has new flooring. The front bench seat has also been recovered in matching blue and white and seatbelts fitted. As part of the package you get an original 1960s period awning, cooker, collapsible table and chairs combined, step, wash bowl, fridge, loo, heater, 2 fire extinguishers, TV with satellite dish. There is a gear lever/handbrake lock and a pedal lock for security. In fact everything you need for camping and probably loads of stuff you don't need. I'm looking for offers around Â£27K.",
