    "content" : "hi,\n<br> all was fine with my cargo door lock etc until today.\n<br> i can lock and unlock with the key in the door handle no problem but when i use the handle to try and open the door it only goes part of the way down which is not always enough the get the bar at the top and the bottom of the cargo door to clear so i can open it.\n<br> another issue is that i have to manually push the striker part of the door back towards the body of the lock inside the bus so i can get it open.\n<br> not sure if something has come loose inside and thought for me its more sensible to ask those that know rather than mess it up.\n<br> help would be much appreciated.\n<br> rob",

    "content" : "Something is clearly fouling somewhere, it could be really easy to find. With both doors open check the square holes in the body where the rods locate top and bottom. Are they clear ? Again with both doors open check you have full movement in each handle. You will be able to see the rods pop out of the door and back again. Movement of the handle should be smooth without any tight spots or fouling. If all is well the next thing to check would be the rods are lining up nicely with the holes in the body when the door is shut. Shut one door at a time checking you get full movement of the handle as the rods locate. Hopefully by now you will have a better idea where things are going wrong. The lock itself is pretty basic stuff, even a few squirts of WD40 might sort any sticking inside before you start pulling things apart.",
