    "content" : "Folks\n<br>Am currently in angers, franc and due to head for Nantes.\n<br>The bus has been making a knocking sound for a while at slow pace, traffic lights, toll booth etc, which I put down to loose front wheel bearing (resolved), slight play in front king pin (now on the to do list), but more recent investigation revealed likely rear near side related.\n<br>Bus has redux boxes with gearbox rebuilt with taller ring and pinion.otherwise pretty standard.\n<br>If bus is rocked side to side there is movement laterally of the axle housing and the gearbox. Obviously can't see inside due to boot. \n<br>Have checked other side and there is no movement laterally at the same point.\n<br>Doesn't appear play in either wheel bearing. All replaced couple years ago.\n<br>So - what are my options? Would seem this is cause of knocking each rotation of wheel at slow speed.\n<br>I have split redux box before but don't have manual, many tools or confort of home garage.\n<br>Likely to last or need resolving?\n<br>Any help appreciated.\n<br>Thanks in advance\n<br>Cheers \n<br>Ada",

The domes pivot on each other like a ball in a socket. \n<br>\n<br>If the outer tubes are moving a tiny amount, it could be just badly set up, but if the tube is moving freely by the amount you said, (but the retainer is solid), then I think the axle tube has snapped off the end \"dome\".\n<br>\n<br>If that is correct, you don't have anything keeping the wheel in the correct place other than the spring plate and that can flex laterally too easily so the inner axle circlip with the gearbox will be experiencing lateral forces is not designed to withstand.",

    "content" : "I agree with Jim - the outer axle tube has sheared wher it joins the 'domed' part. It might be possible to weld it back on in situ as a temporary fix, but there is a lot of oil there so a fire risk. Suggest draining all oil from gearbox, remove boot and use brake cleaner to wash oil from broken part. Welding needs to be done quickly with quenching between welds so you don't melt the plastic spacer behind. I would take the bus to a local agricultural engineer as in my experience in France, they are often better than garages for this kind of work.",
