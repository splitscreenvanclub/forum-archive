Who has the best panels these days and is anyone breaking. I have a 66 panel van converted to a camper. I inherited the van like this and need some advice sorting it out.\n<br> The windows behind driver side are the tops of doors welded in place. The back two windows have been cutout and then plates welded back in place filling the holes. Can anyone shed some light please...\n<br> \n<br> [\n<img src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p716/vwwales/null_zpsf7ccfb8b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> [\n<img src=\"http://i1347.photobucket.com/albums/p716/vwwales/null_zps3774040a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> I have added some images\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Geraint\n<br> \n<br> Sorry not figured out how to upload pictures yet.",

If it was a camper once do you know which type? the more clued on here will no doubt know more on that.\n<br> RE the windows if you can weld to open those two up is not to big a job would be nicer IMHO.\n<br> \n<br> Laters\n<br> \n<br> Ade",
