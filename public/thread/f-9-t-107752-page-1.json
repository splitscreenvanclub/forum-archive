I'm planning on going there in June and I don't really want to be located at a campsite 20 miles away from the event.\n<br>According to the organisers camping is not allowed at the show which seems a bit strange? \n<br>So if anyone on here has been there in the past and has any tips or advice on the bad camberg thing it would be greatly appreciated.",
