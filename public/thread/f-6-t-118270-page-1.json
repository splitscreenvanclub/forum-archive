The 10mm nut is adjusted all the way to the bottom so i've figured there's something going on inside the brake drum.\n<br> Have removed the rear drum and found out that the right hand side star adjuster just keeps spinning around and doesnt push the brake pad out - suspect this is my problem.\n<br> \n<br> As shown in the pic below, the left hand side adjuster is working and pushing the brake pad out, but I can turn the right hand side one forever and a day and its just not moving the brake pad. \n<br> \n<br> Is something broken inside the adjuster holder?\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/oaha74bjd/star.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

    "content" : "From memory they adjust in and out because of the thread on the \"bolt\" part that slots into the holder and on to the end of the brake shoe. Sounds like your thread is damaged may be so a simple and cheap fix to buy a new one along with a new star adjuster I would suggest and just pop it in as the holder part is just a hole/cylinder in which it pushes.\n<br> \n<br> I would have suggested your star adjuster was just stuck on but assuming you have left the shoe in the slot whilst attempting to turn it that can't be the case and leads me to think it is the thread instead. Of course it could be the star adjuster without a thread equally so again I'd just replace both to be sure. \n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xProd=1709\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.machine7.com/product.php?xProd=1709</a>\n<br> \n<br> That's my thoughts anyway. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",

Hopefully it's the adjuster and not the thread in the backing plate.\n<br> A new adjuster and bolt is a couple of quid a new backing plate is a lot more!\n<br> It does look like the spring plate is also missing but that wouldn't stop the adjuster adjusting out, it would stop it staying adjusted after reassembly.",

Mine did.\n<br> You can wire it up so it can't move or you can put a new spring in, which isn't as easy as it might sound as it's part of the backing plate.",
