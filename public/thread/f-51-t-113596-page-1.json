In the 1970s it got sold along with another school bus to a local guy who chopped one of them up for parts, and used this one as a storage shed in his garden. When he decided to let the bus go I couldn't resist the individual paint job and signwriting and bought it to tuck away for a rainy day. I have too many projects on the go though and don't know when I'll get around to this one so I've now decided to offer it for sale.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is NOVA registered and comes with the US title so easy to register over here. VIN tag, VIN stamp &amp; M-Code plate are all present &amp; correct.\n<br>\n<br>The bus needs an engine but all other running gear, steering, fuel tank, etc. are in place, although obviously will need going through. The bus is sat on 15\" solids with old tyres that will hold air and she rolls fine for loading / unloading.\n<br>\n<br>The upper body is in generally very good condition with minimal rust, but the bus does need the usual lower 6\" work. The main chassis rails are good, and the I-beams look solid, but it needs the usual outriggers, jack points, inner &amp; outer sills, rear corners, battery trays, floors and front lower nose, etc. All of this is available off the shelf in the UK from Schofields, AutoCraft, etc. The gutters and roof are really nice bar a section over the passenger area that needs repair. The roof also has a small hole drilled in each corner where red spotlights were once mounted for school run duties. Personally I'd source some old spotlights and put these back \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\"> The cargo doors are good, and the cabs only need fairly minor repairs.\n<br>\n<br>Inside the bus the OG Mango Green paint is nice and thick and should clean up well. The dash is uncut and the bulkhead &amp; underseat section are good although the doglegs will need repairing or replacing. Outside the OG paint is still present under the yellow respray and stencilled signwriting, along with just enough Patina to make it a very cool looking bus. Again this yellow should polish up really well \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br>\n<br>Most of the glass is with the bus, including a couple of pieces loose inside the bus, although a couple of pieces are cracked. The bus was ordered with 6 pop-outs which is a cool option on a Standard. The pop-outs are still present. The bus is missing seats, handles, (although the funky lever that the driver used to open the door and let the schoolkids out is still present), window catches, speedo, wipers, bumpers and some other small parts but most of this stuff is available as reproduction if you can't be bothered sourcing OG parts.\n<br>\n<br>Here's a bunch more photos of this very cool bus with a ton of potential: \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://s1179.photobucket.com/user/busben76/library/60%20mango%20schoolbus\">http://s1179.photobucket.com/user/busbe ... 0schoolbus</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>Feel free to ring or PM for more details, or come and check it out in Somerset - DT9.\n<br>\n<br>Overseas buyers welcome.\n<br>\n<br>Reduced to £8500 or nearest offer!!!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks guys.\n<br>\n<br>Ben (07742 408558)",
