Somebody could have got seriously taken to the cleaners with this obvious clone. When my mate started to have a go at the seller and pointing out a few obvious flaws he soon got in his van and drove off. Fair enough if you want to sell a van at least man up and tell the truth. At the end of the day that so called Samba was probably a clone from Thailand, dont try to fleece the innocent. And talking of rip offs what about a well known company advertising a bay on its pitch Friday night for £22500, Saturday they had changed the price to £24000 and guess what, it was still unsold at 5pm Sunday, not that this was a clone just an honest original bay. What has happened to the VW community it seems to have been taken over by\" get as much money as we can\" people.",
