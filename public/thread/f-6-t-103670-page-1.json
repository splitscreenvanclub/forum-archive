I have earlybay irs setup on rear so I have plenty of room to widen the track a bit and bring the wheel 'out' towards the wheel arch. Only thing getting me worried is getting the wheel on or off. I'm not stupidly low and tried it with a 195 70 14 on a standard rim and it just squeezed under the arch.",
