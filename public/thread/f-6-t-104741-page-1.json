If I were to fit as per the instructions then I would be cutting through the joint where two panels meet and and would take away the strength in the joint.\n<br> To be honest I wish I never started it but I have already removed the original frame horns so I can't really go back now. Does anyone have any advice on how I should do this?",

If you get it wrong, you can damage the shock absorber and waste a lot of money. Dave Palmer was very helpful over choosing the right length - it all depends on the ride height with a normal load on board. My advice would be don't buy the shock absorbers until the suspension has settled down and the height is finalised.",
