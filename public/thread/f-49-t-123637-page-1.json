    "content" : "Indeed..\n<br> I found a plan to build a rotisserie on thesamba.com and I bought the material from metals4you. Matt Attwood who works with Dave Haywood took the design and fabricated it, with a few modifications. A local machinist cut the blanks for the plates that bolt to front n rear beams and drilled the mounting holes. The design was modified so that the rotisserie could also be mounted on a wheeled frame.\n<br> A word of warning.. I bought heavy wall tubing to remove the danger of any flexing. Matt is an excellent fabricator and made a superb job.\n<br> I will add the link to the plans and provide you by email or PM my purchase list for material, if you require\n<br> I will also add a link to my SSVC thread showing the pictures of it fabricated and in use.\n<br> Also my 62 was in a really bad way so unusually it was a side off roof off and fit before ever putting on the rotisserie.\n<br> Dave has spit mounts too and used to have a share in or borrow a rotisserie but this has added to his kit for independence.\n<br> G",

    "content" : "Having played with it, it rotates one segment and then you can pull it back to the starting point and rotate it another segment etc.\n<br> The issues with the spit style I have pictures of is that they need an engine hoist style wide based frame at each end and you fit a frame to engine cradle and to front chassis legs and jack up each end and then swivel so you do require a footprint at each end for the hoist.\n<br> These are some of the photos I have of using the spit before fitting the exterior frame.\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20190712/8daeab9459cfde9118fb7a48c853bc8c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20190712/2f84cf57772e6bbd901ac7ea519a2235.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20190712/1046c64d7ba5f58d8f758f9e22017ae9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20190712/e5bac4cc733688d332270703850b768c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20190712/e2992b9584ce30494ea02ce35ac52b56.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>",
