    "content" : "Two questions regarding the Easco fluorescent light:\n<br>\n<br>In my ’63 I recall that the light was connected to the battery via a single (in line fused) wire from the battery + terminal. I can’t remember exactly where it was routed, but basically it just hung down from the void between the rear parcel shelf and outer skin.\n<br>Can anyone confirm the original arrangements for this?\n<br>\n<br>Secondly and more importantly, is anyone running one of these lights on 12v. The original transformer sat in the upper rear shelf timberwork. Would I need to butcher some modern caravan light for a 12v light transformer and then run wires from this to the original light mount?\n<br>Or can I just punt 12v through the original transformer.... perhaps I don’t need the transformer at all – i’m not very electrical minded.\n<br>\n<br>Any suggestions welcome – what arrangement have you for an original Easco on 12v?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks,\n<br>Julian",

    "content" : "I've also done the same thing - bought a light off ebay for 12 quid, stripped it out and put all the workings into the 6v one I had. Works a treat but I did have to wire in an extra in line switch as the OG switch tripped the fuse each time, so I guess I must have done something wrong somewhere, or maybe a 6v switch won't work on 12v electrics.",

To be fair upgrading the two original interior lights to LEDs and new clear lenses gives a nicer light than the fluorescent.",
