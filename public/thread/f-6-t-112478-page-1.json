It has been used on an occasional basis for quite a few years and although it starts easily and runs smoothly, it does not have very much power. I know that the 1200 motor is not renowned for being the most powerful unit on the planet, but this one is certainly lacklustre in that respect. (BTW it is fitted in my Oval, so it is not having to shift the weight of a Bus).\n<br>\n<br>I'm undecided as to whether it needs an overhaul or whether I'm expecting too much of it. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks in anticipation.",

Your figures are good to start with but more importantly are closer together. As said, generally 100 psi is signs of a worn engine, but if all four cylinders are similar (like yours) you'll probably find that 100 psi engine will run happily for a good few years before having to open it up. Especially if you drive it accordingly. \n<br>\n<br>The warm or cold engine difference will not amount to more than 3-4 psi\n<br>\n<br>Hth",
