    "content" : "Thank you - it took a while but it turned out OK in the end.\n<br> \n<br> I think the main issues in the Type1/Type4 discussion revolve around ease of fitting and cost. Type4 engines cost quite a lot more to rebuild than the Type1 and good quality new parts are hard to find. The replacement cooling system is also expensive, whichever design you choose. For some of the fitment problems, there are no off-the-shelf solutions, thus there is always additional work required. The user base of the Type4 engine is much smaller, so the support situation in all respects is not as good or as extensive as for the Type1.\n<br> \n<br> The Split Bus is not the Type4 engine's natural home, hence it demands more time and money to get it to fit properly. Having said that, once it's in, it's a great combination and well worth the effort. It's just a pity that it won't fit with it's normal cooling system - that would save a lot of work and expense!\n<br> \n<br> Dave.",

On that basis, with it being a lighter vehicle, a stock Type4 Split should return at least that. As suggested above, don't go mad with performance upgrades - they're not needed and will probably result in higher running costs. Keep it stock if possible.\n<br> \n<br> Dave (D)",

    "content" : "You can use the shallow heat exchangers as fitted to the 411/412 cars or the deeper Bus ones, but in either case they have to be shortened at the rear end to allow the muffler to fit inside the rear valance of the bus. (I'm not sure what is fitted to a Porsche 914 - it might be worth further investigation). The Bus type deliver more heat than the shallow ones as they have internal fins - the shallow ones have no fins. It wouldn't be difficult to modify either type if you are competent with an angle grinder and a welder!\n<br> \n<br> CSP used to offer shortened versions of the shallow type (see pic), but they were very expensive and presumably would provide even less heat than unmodified ones. As a result I decided not to fit heat exchangers at all.\n<br> \n<br> The other main issue with fitting heat exchangers is the provision of an air flow from the cooling shroud. The DTM shroud has no air outlets - not sure about a Porsche fan shroud - but I imagine it would be possible to incorporate some. You would need to determine the best position on the shroud to install them, so as not to affect the air flow to the cylinders. Again, I decided not to bother and fitted stainless headers which I had made to measure.\n<br> Vintage Speed used to sell special short stainless headers for this purpose.\n<br> \n<br> I take it you are contemplating undertaking a Type4 conversion?
