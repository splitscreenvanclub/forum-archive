    "content" : "OK rebuilding my motor due to a apparent woodruff key failure on the timing gear. \n<br>\n<br>Considering upping to an 84mm crank. Been offered very low milage 48 idf 's for my 45 Del's.\n<br>\n<br>Not fixed on a can choice but looking for any ideas or comments. \n<br>\n<br>Looking to also move away from using this as daily motor all year round &amp; consider running my spare engine more during winter. \n<br>\n<br>Thank Brian.",

    "content" : "If it's going to more of a race motor then the 48's are perfect.\n<br>As for the cam, the webcam 86c is a very good cam for high rpm, doesn't do much before 4k but will hang into 7500-8000rpm no problem.\n<br>If money us no object then a JPM Raptor cam is the way forward and worth another 20-30 hp over a \"normal\" cam - not cheap but the best you can buy.\n<br>\n<br>One thing I would absolutely recommend is that once you have the crank, flywheel and clutch together have them balanced as a complete unit, it's essential for longevity\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps\n<br>\n<br>Orb",

    "content" : "Funny that, money is an issue at the mo but engines always seem to come first. \n<br>\n<br>Took my current 82mm to Stateside this morning to be balanced with one of their full weight flywheels and stage 1 \n<br>\n<br>Then decided to buy a new DPR 82 crank, which jim will do all the above work to. Now that I'm considering taking a little longer and build something better. Currently have a new fk8 to replace what I had but could hopefully exchange that up. \n<br>\n<br>Only have my bus for transport but realizing I need look after this size motor in terms of milage.",
