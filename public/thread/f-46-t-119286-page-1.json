(wrong)\n<br> Period reversing lights for indicators.\n<br> Original Westy rack, but they only belong on Westy's IMO.\n<br> Most things on the snag list could be reversed.\n<br> All in all i think it's pretty special, just a few tweeks needed here and there, it could make an old Devon pervert very happy....",
