Was aiming for mid Sept but Clare annoyingly ( but correctly as usaual \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> ) pointed out that it would just get scatched / damaged / chipped while I was doing everything else, so....the plan is now to put in the steering box, new brake lines and other bits and pieces that are easier to do while it's still on it's side. Then cut up the rotiserie and make some of those dolly trolley things that go under the wheels so it's easy to move around, so I can start putting the front beam and rear end back on.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w254/clareyf/61%20Split/2010_07250001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Last year I bought a later gearbox with the large nut RGB's from a running bus so I'm hoping that they should all go on without having to do too much work first. Then the front beam and the like. All stock height \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>Then have a go at building an engine from the two I have sat in the garage \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> going for a 1600 SP\n<br>\n<br>Plus I guess 6 weeks for me to get it all prepped and painted is pushing it a bit !!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>The final colour is Clares choice, but I know she wants it Turqouise and White. Which means she'll be down at B&amp;Q looking at those cards with every colour under the sun on them, find the one she likes and get the paint made up to match.\n<br>\n<br>It will also be a nice break from welding and bodywork and get on with some mechanics and electrics.\n<br>\n<br>Gonna upgrade to dual brakes as well.",
