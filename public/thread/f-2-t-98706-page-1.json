I'm not taking anything away from these buses but we've all seen them before and know what they look like. It would be nice to see some different ones in the small pics that are in with the text. As an example, I've just opened a mag at a show report and I've seen 4 pictures of the same buses in other different show features or mag features before. Flick through to a feature not about a show and again the accompanying picture shows more well known buses. \n<br> Is it just me ? Am I reading too many mags and they all start to get a bit \"samey\". Dunno, what do other people think?\n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee.",

As for the VW mags, I haven't bought any of them for years because it got to a point all you saw were red and brown 23 windows on the cover, lol.

I subscribe to camper and commercial because I've always done so from issue one and have them all in binders and I don't want to break up the set, then I subscribe to volksworld camper and bus because I can't resist a freebie hoody (can't remember the last time I actually paid for a hoody), then I subscribe to Hayburner because it's a proper grass roots mag which I think you've gotta support because it's a bunch of blokes without the corporate b******t plus I like the features they do on the crazy bikes, then I occasionally buy a volksworld or maybe every once in a while an ultra vw if there's a bug in it that I like.

If you hear about an interesting story then tell a mag editor or write it up yourself. \n<br> \n<br> I know that editors have real problems with content - not enough stuff submitted on history of VWs, technical articles, road trips etc. That's why you get lots of 'show and shine' features with the same old buses lined up.
