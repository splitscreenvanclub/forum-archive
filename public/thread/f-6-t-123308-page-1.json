    "content" : "Hi like most I recently pulled my van out for the summer. last month when I went to Ninove I noticed when driving along the motorway about half throttle the bus would occasional judder only very briefly.\n<br> it progressively has got worst pulling away under load I now start kangarooing down the road in 2,3 or 4th. would this be a clutch issue or something else ? \n<br> \n<br> the gearbox/clutch ir only a couple of years old with 2k miles done.\n<br> any advice appreciated\n<br> thanks\n<br> Aaron",
