The earth goes to the other tab with a G sign ~ the red wire in your picture. \n<br> The earth by the way runs back to the sender unit which in turn is earthed to the chassis.

    "content" : "If you actually look at the wiring diagram I referred to above you can see that there is \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">no</span> earth attached to the gauge via the short central nut/thread. This is because the gauge is earthed to the dash via the metal clamp that is attached via the two longer threaded rods at each side, to hold the gauge in place. Should this bracket be missing then yes, you will need to earth it via the central nut as gazpilot has done in his picture.\n<br> Picture below of correct bracket and knurled nuts:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1037952.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
