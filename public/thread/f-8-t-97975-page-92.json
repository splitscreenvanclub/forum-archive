This coming week I'm hoping to get the Vespa over to the paint shop \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> It's being done in the same colours as Rusty, as a sort of test or trial run, just to see if the paint scheme looks ok \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>Today was another snow day and the cave floor is once again covered in filler dust, along with me, though I've had a shower now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> My first job today was to begin \"roughing out\" the n/s/r corner. This is all original. I had to weld up a few holes and beat out some dents and I also installed a leisure battery tray instead of the standard gas bottle tray. I paid attention to getting the bottom edge nice and level (although I doubt it will ever be seen) to match the new o/s \n<br>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1929_zpseccy44ub.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1929_zpseccy44ub.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The concurrent job is the second cargo door which is coming along nicely \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> , albeit slowly \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1930_zpsiyejmr6g.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1930_zpsiyejmr6g.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>There is no doubt about it. Filler work is deeply boring \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> although I know if I keep \"chipping away\" then it will eventually be done.

Rusty made himself useful and became a drinks tray \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1933_zpsphow4io1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1933_zpsphow4io1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Laters,\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

Run a sandwich plare thermostat and your sreted aswell as adding external oil filter at the same time.
