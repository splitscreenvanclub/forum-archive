I got my trusty stanley on it and discovered it was in fact gauze. rusty gauze to be precise and not worth sh!t. I picked it off and it was just dust really so obviously causing and obstruction. \n<br>\n<br>Inside I could feel the top of another \"rod\" but it was surrounded by dirt so I had a dig and a clean and the something happened !\n<br>\n<br>something happened that made me think \" there's now way I'm repairing this now - this is going to cost ANOTHER Â£60\"\n<br>\n<br>you see , it wasn't a \"rod\" inside but a small ball bearing and I had just flicked it out and heard it land - somewhere - and then roll somewhere, on the cab floor. roll off the cab floor and onto the gravel drive way and it's going to cost Â£60. roll over the cab floor and through one of the holes for the foot pedals onto the gravel drive way and it's going to cost Â£60.\n<br>\n<br>I did however, carefully, manage to find said ball bearing and will endveour to fix soon.\n<br>\n<br>\"why don't things work like they should do\" -
