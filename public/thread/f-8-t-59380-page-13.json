    "content" : "ok rusty here's a quick update with a quick pic, more to follow shortly.\n<br>\n<br>so,\n<br>\n<br>as you can see in the above pics I got the electrics sorted but something I haven't mentioned ( well might of had a moan about earlier ) is, for now years !, the metal dash tray has been connected to the speedo cable and caught around the pedals and hand break and this was a job I was really looking forward to getting done.\n<br>\n<br>I managed to find a suitable t section for the water pipes and connected the washer up and got the dash fitted. even found the old 8 track and put that in for nostalgia sake \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>put some water in and the bloody thing dosent work \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>\n<br>BRAND NEW !\n<br>\n<br>from some show from yester year, no idea who from now.\n<br>\n<br>took the top off and noticed there are two holes underneath. one had a \"rod \" inside and the other looked like dirt - this was the culprite. I got my trusty stanley on it and discovered it was in fact gauze. rusty gauze to be precise and not worth sh!t. I picked it off and it was just dust really so obviously causing and obstruction. \n<br>\n<br>Inside I could feel the top of another \"rod\" but it was surrounded by dirt so I had a dig and a clean and the something happened !\n<br>\n<br>something happened that made me think \" there's now way I'm repairing this now - this is going to cost ANOTHER £60\"\n<br>\n<br>you see , it wasn't a \"rod\" inside but a small ball bearing and I had just flicked it out and heard it land - somewhere - and then roll somewhere, on the cab floor. roll off the cab floor and onto the gravel drive way and it's going to cost £60. roll over the cab floor and through one of the holes for the foot pedals onto the gravel drive way and it's going to cost £60.\n<br>\n<br>I did however, carefully, manage to find said ball bearing and will endveour to fix soon.\n<br>\n<br>\"why don't things work like they should do\" -
