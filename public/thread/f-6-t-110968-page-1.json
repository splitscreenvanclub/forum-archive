    "content" : "Hi all , \n<br>\n<br>So i asked this question on our dutch forum but couldn't get a clear answer. \n<br>\n<br>My bus needed new wheel bearings up front . So that got fixed. After putting everything back together the bus keeps pulling to the right when braking and right drum gets really hot. \n<br>\n<br>Now here's whats all new , Hard brakelines from master cilinder to flexibles , flexibles , all 4 brake pumps in the drums up front. Small hard lines in the drums. Also new wheel bearings. \n<br>Not new , brake shoes and drums. Master cilinder itself (but works fine , single circuit) \n<br>\n<br>Brakes are well adjusted (4 teeth above , and 4 below) left and right . But this didn't help so we adjusted the right one some more. \n<br>\n<br>When bus is in the air wheels turn around free. \n<br>\n<br>We tried everything , can't seem to find the problem that the bus is pulling to the right and the right drum is getting really hot. \n<br>\n<br>So any ideas ?",

( the bus is pulling to the right because the right is doing most the braking)",
