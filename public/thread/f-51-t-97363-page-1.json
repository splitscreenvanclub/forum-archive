    "content" : "June ' 53 deluxe, birth cert included , relevant import papers etc. In the u.k. A rare opportunity to own 1 of less than 150 known worldwide. It's a project for someone with lots done and lots to do, lots of parts with it, including some very nice nos cargo doors , nos engine lid and pretty much all the metalwork panels included. There is a build thread on here, although it hasn't been updated it for a long time and some work has done since but it will give you an idea of what it's about (no porsche parts now), its been in storage for nearly 3 years now. I will get some up to date pics for anyone that's genuinally interested, its a big project but not very often a bd deluxe will come up for sale. Any viewings welcomed.\n<br> I realise a price has to be put on , very hard to value, i guess offers around 25k . Thanks. \n<br>\n<br> \n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=34719\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=34719</a>\n<!-- l -->",
