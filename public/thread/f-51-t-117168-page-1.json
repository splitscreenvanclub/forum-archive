    "content" : "This truly is my dream bus and one that I never thought I would sell, but I need to invest further into my business, so here goes.\n<br>The Duchess is a 1960 RHD very original Westfalia SO23, with semaphore indicators. The first owner was a British doctor, who travelled over to Germany in 1960 to collect his beautiful new camper van from the factory and drive back through Europe and then to his home of South Africa. This destination gave our early SO23 the extremely rare option of RHD, plus some interesting hot country M codes and factory semaphore indicators .\n<br>In July '77 this rare right hand drive, sub hatch Westy came to the UK and has had just 8 further owners. Barn stored for the last 14 years and looks beautifully like a freshly found treasure. I have replaced the complete braking system, done some welding, and exchanged the original 1192cc engine with a more drivable 1600, however the 1192 is still included in the sale. I'll be mot'ing her this week, so she'll be ready to go.\n<br>The interior is almost complete only missing the shot glasses and the table is not original. All the cabinets are there, the upholstery is all there and also comes with a role of NOS red and black material to recover the back seats, should you wish to. The cab bunk is there, all the curtains, cargo net, bread box, working clamshell interior lights. \n<br>\n<br>M Codes: \n<br>114 : x6 pop out side windows with extra long spoon latches \n<br>156 : Large oil bath air cleaner with additional cyclone filter \n<br>168 : 88 ampere/hour battery (6V)\n<br>181 : Chrome hubcaps \n<br>234 : MPH speedometer \n<br>544 : \"Kundendienstwerkstatt\" (i.e. \"service room\", special place for conversions made by Volkswagen itself)\n<br>\n<br>J23 : SO23 Westfalia interior, with chemical toilet and petrol cooker (both of these items are missing)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The list the un-originality to this age of type 2..... \n<br>12 volt alternator / coil, bulbs etc. \n<br>Head liner \n<br>Paint below the roof gutter \n<br>Front safari windows ? \n<br>\n<br>Original: \n<br>Ignition key and x2 door keys \n<br>Small Sekurit logo glass except for front screens \n<br>1192cc engine with factory cyclone air filter for dusty climates \n<br>Reduction hub gears box \n<br>RHD left hand loading ORIGINAL SO23 Westfalia interior with sub hatch \n<br>Westfalia canvas awning and poles, though sides need work \n<br>South African number plate and ZA plate \n<br>15 inch wheels x5 \n<br>Bumpers front and back \n<br>\n<br>Bad bits: \n<br>Various areas on the bodywork need work, but you can use just as it is and love her and a perfect candidate for a concourse restoration at some point in the future, restored this bus would sell for 65,000.\n<br>\n<br>Good bits: \n<br>All of the lights are currently working including the semaphore turn signals \n<br>Interesting KDF scripted rear light lens? possible Kubbelwagen parts?\n<br>All gears select in the box \n<br>Good tight RHD steering box \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>Registered in the UK on MSK 816 and V5C is in my name\n<br>Will be mot'd\n<br>\n<br>NOS plaid material in same red/black check to recover original faded/torn seat coverings\n<br>\n<br>This 56 year old bus is still pretty original on the whole yet please study the photographs , many more available or better still arrange to view, you'll not be disappointed ...... this is a rare early right hand drive semaphore camper van which needs to go to someone who will resurrect it to its former glory and go camping or enjoy just as it is, with all its aged charm! \n<br>\n<br>I'm looking for offers close to 32,500, you can reach me on 07972055868 thank you, Bob. \n<br>I've fallen very much in love with the charms of this little old lady, she's like your Grandma, wrapped up into a camper, so don't be surprised if this advert disappears \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\"
