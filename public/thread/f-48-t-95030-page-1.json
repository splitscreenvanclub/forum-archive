I have the small cupboards with side hinges, not the fold down ones. Mine had a combination of aluminium rivets and brass screws with raw plugs (I guess these are incorrect!!!).\n<br>\n<br>So should the correct fixings be rivets?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance.",

I have searched around but cannot find any of the 4mm (5/32\") original looking punch rivets.\n<br>\n<br>I think so far the second best I have come up with is these black rivets \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/280907168727?ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1438.l2649\">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/280907168727? ... 1438.l2649</a>\n<!-- m --> and I will back them with 4mm aluminium washers to ensure they stay in place. I will have to nick the side off the washer to fit at the back adjacent to the cupboard.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Raymond",
