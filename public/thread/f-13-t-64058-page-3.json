Then along comes my doublecab &amp; I get ten votes...hey thanks much for the Stateside newbie kudos; I am honoured. I entered it on a mere whim just for the adventure. Actually, I've yet to do anything to it--I've had it for some ten weeks now &amp; the plan is to deal with the rust spots especially in the bed and around the hinges, and to close a couple little holes...plus some upholstery work and getting the radio to work once again. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks again.",
