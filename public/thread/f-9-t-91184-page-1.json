It's no bigger than a range rover, that's the way we looked at it!\n<br>\n<br>We have had a cabin on an over night ferry &amp; it was great. We had a fab nights sleep ( important if you have a little one), breakfast, then fresh for the onwards journey. \n<br>\n<br>Good luck with the trip. Look up \"The bus driver\" Stephan on here. He did a massive road trip round Europe with his new born a few years ago. You might pick up some handy tips!",
