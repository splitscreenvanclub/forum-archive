If you're planning on selling a vehicle you now have the chance to park it outside the main building, or inside - but, note that public access to the vehicles for sale hall doesn't commence until 10am, and exiting the hall won't be until about 3am or just after. If you need to leave early you can still park in an outside sales area - in front of the main building. The cost to sell your VW is.... nothing. It's free, and that includes parking it inside. If you're selling, upload your vehicle details on the site and we'll do our best to help you sell.\n<br> \n<br> We still have vacancies for free autojumble stands (yep, giving them away too), but please phone to confirm. One or two at most, maybe more if we can manage it - you just might miss out on a table and get the floor space. LOL.\n<br> \n<br> Details of are on the website: \n<a href=\"http://www.dubfreeze.co.uk/two\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.dubfreeze.co.uk/two</a>\n<br> \n<br> Thanks,\n<br> \n<br> Paul",
