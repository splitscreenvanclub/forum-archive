The closest ral, which was very close was RAL 9018, however various people on the samba etc say the most similar is traffic white (9016) which is far whiter than 9018. This is becoming a pain and I need to paint Friday. I'm painting everything anyway, so no blending required, it would be a keen eye to pick it, but can anyone confirm if I should be looking at 9016 or 9018. Ie is it pretty white, or surprisingly grey in the tin. Thanks\n </div>\n</blockquote> Go for the whiter one!\n<br> \n<br> Gill.",
