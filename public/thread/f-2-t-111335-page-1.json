I was wondering how much they were, and if I could add extras like a split charge loom and modern stereo connector?\n<br> \n<br> I tried emailing from his website a couple of times, but no response. I know he must be really busy, so thought I'd try on here too!\n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Adrian",
