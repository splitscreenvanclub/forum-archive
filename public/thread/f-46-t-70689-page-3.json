I have the front harnesses in but they need fettling.\n<br>\n<br>I am currently fitting the ply floor in the back, then I can fit the floor tiles, then try out the Devon interior - at this point I'll need to work out how to do the seat belts - I have anchor points installed just not sure how to get through the wood with the belts...\n<br>\n<br>Must crack on with that floor now.\n<br>\n<br>Dave",
