    "content" : "yes finally went down the track.\n<br>\n<br>Itr was just a test to see how it all feels, data shows I was only using max 40% throttle and I got of it many times as it seamed to be going faster than I expected. I was just unsure of how it was all going to go.\n<br>\n<br>The next two passes were terrible as shifting became a real problem.\n<br>\n<br>Engine only makes power to 5100 and with the cam should start to come alive at this point making power to 8000. Found the issue and will sort it in the next couple of weeks so hopefully then we can start to make some real power. It made an easy 350 RWHP at 5100 but nosed over after that, still very fat in the fuel and conservative in the spark. \n<br>\n<br>Should be on the track soon.\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=803169123111266&amp;pnref=story\">https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=80 ... nref=story</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10204847136232008&amp;pnref=story\">https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10 ... nref=story</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10204845598153557&amp;pnref=story\">https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10 ... nref=story</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Phil",
