    "content" : "'66 Walkthrough bus. Price: Â£13,995\n<br>\n<br>German built bus, imported from the USA.\n<br>\n<br>Great project bus with some good patina / paint fade.\n<br>Rust around the roof is just surface, no soft spots or holes. \n<br>Needs some lower body resto. \n<br>The longside has had a sill riveted on which should be easy to put right as they have not welded it so no distortion. Needs lower body resto but pretty good underneath.\n<br>Body overall straight with no collision damage only a few dents as shown in pics. \n<br>Nice dash. \n<br>Ideal bus to do the repairs and some paint blending then run as is. \n<br>No motor.\n<br>A file of around 160 pics will tell the full story. \n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://s174.photobucket.com/user/fbivw/slideshow/66%20Walkthrough%20Bus\">http://s174.photobucket.com/user/fbivw/ ... ough%20Bus</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>Delivery no problem in the UK and assistance with shipping elsewhere.",
