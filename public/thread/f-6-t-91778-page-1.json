    "content" : "i used to use a snap-on 130 which is just like a lot of the others being a ceabora but badged machine. but like most of them, they don't perform to well down the bottom end of the amp range.\n<br> what i did was to search out one in as good condition as i could find that was made about 15yrs ago. the reason for that is that those early machines were built with copper core transformers. nice big ones that gives you more control then using it in those lower power ranges.\n<br> all the makes mentioned earlier have made welders with quality components but when i was looking i fell over a murex 160 tradesmig on ebay for Â£199 buy it now. i was prompted by a mail from the guy who runs the migwelding forum who's advice i had asked \"what to buy\" he said if i didn't buy it, he would! so thats what i'm using. very nice too. no more .... welding!\n<br> keep away from halfords and the like.\n<br> cheers",
