    "content" : "Ok not a splitty but next best thing in the family. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>Once a seedling blossoms what next when your kids reach that age. For me like my 18 year old daughter Hollie just has it was time for her first car, hols was instantly a stock classic beetle dad. \n<br>Ok not a splitty but this is the bank of mum &amp; dad at the end of this so Air-cooled , flat-four’d with all the love you get from an old VW will suffice &amp; all she’d need, so that’s my girls says this proud dad. So March 2014 purchased one &amp; for this last year having been restoring the beetle doing everything in true home resto fashion in the cave on my own...... working evenings, weekends amongst cruising in the bus, camping out with mates, surfing &amp; normal life.\n<br>We spent ages last year as you do hunting &amp; looking at many for something reasonable &amp; solid. Looked at a lot of rotters &amp; was able to walk away looking with our head &amp; not heart. This took some time to find what we wanted but eventually found a 72 std 1300, solid in the right places with good pans, heater channels, A,B posts. Needed some work on the doors, with some rust bubbles here &amp; there with the paint looking very flat but for the age &amp; price had allot of potential compared to others we had seen. Would of loved to get older but had to be realistic as old is exspensive &amp; this would be Hollie’s daily so decided budget was more important. The engine had zero end float purred like a kitten &amp; didn’t smoke so on to a winner there. Inside very tatty &amp; like a chicken coop but the vision was there to tidy up leave with aged look as a first car that would inevitably get a bang or two. No chance i want it shinny dad “ GULP “ so a full resto was now on the cards, oh well all good practice for the bus so money exchanged &amp; cruised home in now who is known as Peggy. That 15 mile drive gave me all i needed &amp; loved every minute of it, totally hooked.\n<br>Spent a few weekends stripping &amp; cleaning out to see what we truly had &amp; what we had actually let ourselves in for. Lists were made of what we needed, made space &amp; plunged in at the deep end.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/Peggy/326A5858-1804-4D7F-83C5-88A8A1CD1D5B.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/Peggy/326A5858-1804-4D7F-83C5-88A8A1CD1D5B.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/Peggy/1BAAB07E-E2C0-4DDE-8578-F28F772D73F5.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/Peggy/1BAAB07E-E2C0-4DDE-8578-F28F772D73F5.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/Peggy/EEF55D68-50EC-4B6F-A497-F8F7B22C9078.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/Peggy/EEF55D68-50EC-4B6F-A497-F8F7B22C9078.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/Peggy/7907B1B6-09C6-4255-B018-FE2EE6A3F668.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/Peggy/7907B1B6-09C6-4255-B018-FE2EE6A3F668.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Luckily with the wings off peggy just fitted in the garage, bit of a squeeze &amp; pain but still needed access to all my tools for building so just needed forward planning.

Skuttle rails on bonnet &amp; front wheel well making good as that was a poor repair, the washer bottle area had also rotted through. Once the wings were off both rear bumper mount sections revealed themselves as these had rotted away hidden by bumper irons &amp; some other little areas that needed new metal to cut out the rusty spots.

    "content" : "Main body took ages as skuttle rails got chopped out &amp; replaced from a donor front end. In some ways could of been easier replacing whole panel but that was way above my ability at that stage. Luckily all the bad bits on peggy the donor front end was good so was a simple chop out weld in, amazingly got the complete front for £30 bargain.\n<br>For the skuttle rail made the cut behind the ali trim line to hide if it went wrong but went a peach.\n<br>\n<br>Then it was prep time on main body so flatted back, all rust chopped out &amp; replaced with new metal luckily not allot. Light skim of filler as required &amp; 2 good coats of high build , In all areas learning as i went so got carried away going through primer first time but another coat then wet flatted &amp; all set for top coat. Being the first time for any of this had never appreciated how much work &amp; prep goes into this so often felt like i was getting know where fast but then felt like leaps and bounds when paint went on. Happy though as know the hard work is hopefully good for years to come again.\n<br>\n<br>Took advantage of the shows on discounts &amp; swap meets, picking up all the goodies plus original chrome bits as some bits that we had was damaged so all good shinny stuff to put back on. Eg headlight chrome rings, wing mirrors etc plus the vw badge as like normal some ass nicks it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/Peggy/8C2D14A7-9B48-4496-94D3-643768274806.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/Peggy/8C2D14A7-9B48-4496-94D3-643768274806.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>At this stage was now November 14 &amp; eventually ready for top coat, still relatively warm although fired up the heater in the cave to speed things up so all masked up &amp; ready for top coat . A massive learning curve as never sprayed anything this size, the high build primer side learnt technique &amp; the gun. Top coat was advice from a pro over the phone &amp; start on small bits, progressing from fuel flap &amp; glove box lid to then doors finally progressing to bonnet &amp; wings. The roof was my dread but a trestle down each side of car &amp; took the plunge. Plenty of mistakes on all parts as i went, learning each time from them but nothing that couldn’t be flatted back. Second coat had to be right &amp; all went to plan, although some areas got a small amount of orange peel this was a simple fix.\n<br>The advice worked well on a big compressor mine a 3hp 14cfm never struggled, gun lvlp 1.8mm &amp; 1.3mm nozzles for primer &amp; top coat respectively, working with 2 pack. My skills and garage not sterile enough for an out the gun finish on the big bits but a flat back, mop &amp; polish gave a finish i was chuffed with &amp; a great shine. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a

    "content" : "Thanks for all your comments although im now not in the good books. Hollie used it for first drive to work this morning got 1/2 mile down the road &amp; alternator light came on so she drove it back, huffed at me &amp; Sandra drove her in. Will get 2 of those looks later oh dam it.\n<br>\n<br>Steve paint was 2 pack ie paint &amp; hardner for both high build primer &amp; top coat keeping both the same as mixing with cellulose gets reactions. Was adviced 2 pack as its easier to work &amp; repair when it goes wrong as a novice sprayer, It was great advice as you simply flatted back &amp; resprayed which i did several times.\n<br>\n<br>1/2 the car simply flatted back the paint for a good key then high builded &amp; top coat. Bonnet was only bit that fought back and reacted. had option to use a blocker but always had a risk so best advice was bare metal &amp; start again ( thanks MarkP )\n<br>\n<br>suppose 1/3 of the car ended an out the gun finish the rest due to paint used bought it back with different polishing papers, mopping &amp; more learning.\n<br>Hope that helps",

Which is a neat thing.\n<br>\n<br>I asked what she'd like as a first car; the answer was Mini, Beetle or Fiat 500. Sadly not the originals. All that time taking her round car shows has done nothing to get her looking at anything retro/classic. B*gger.",

    "content" : "Bren, your daughter is so lucky to have you, car is lovely. \n<br>\n<br>My son Matthew did a couple of months of Young Drivers Scheme near us at Earls Colne, which was great as it is all roads around an airfield and industrial park with the chances of encountering real traffic and lots of junctions (not car park and cones! which a lot of venues are). He has set his heart on a '60 Beetle but is willing to wait a little while. In the meantime he is looking for something cheap to practice and for the first bit after passing his test. He was 17 on 20th Feb and has 2 lessons on the road under his belt. Unfortunately I can't get him added to the insurance on my car (as it is a sport edition!!).",

    "content" : "Terry we decided keep thing consistent and not confuse hollie with different cars so she only drove instructors car till she had passed. Took her just on the year so luckily encounterd driving in all conditions so at least she's aware of them. We was worried on insurance costs but this came in at £520 fully comp in her name with myself and wife as named drivers. \n<br>\n<br>Just had another drive with her today and she's now ready to go solo. Took a while to adjust to the beetle and learn to drive a classic car more than the ease of how a modern car drives. \n<br>She loves her wheels.",
