    "content" : "Hi just had my sealed headlights updated and in the process of the new ones being fitted my left hand light won't come on now when on full beam. Side lights work but Not when switch is pulled out fully. \n<br>It's 1967 but with a reconditioned bay loom and wiring. \n<br>Do I need a new switch or will it be down to the wiring. I have an electrical friend but he hasn't got a full working knowledge of vw's so all help is good. \n<br>Thanks",
