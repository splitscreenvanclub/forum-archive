    "content" : "1959 Deluxe 15 Window.\n<br>\n<br>A genuine German built 1959 15 window deluxe Microbus.\n<br>\n<br>I’ve owned this bus since September 2009, completed the restoration in around 9 months, and since then have covered around 16000 miles, taking me and the wife all around the UK and Europe, and even spending our wedding night in her. Anyone out there who knows me, knows this is my pride and joy and the time effort and money that went into this project was unbelievable. But new adventures are calling and it’s time to sell up. This bus brings stares and smiles everywhere she goes, and deservedly featured in VolksWorld Camper and Bus, picked up a few show awards along the way, and featured on the hallowed creases of Cut Out n’ Keep. \n<br>\n<br>Everything is included in this sale, roof rack, awning etc, just add duvet and fuel for adventures!\n<br>\n<br>Manufactured on 27th April 1959 and originally sold into the USA, Boston. Imported into the UK around June 2009, after being found in scrap yard. This type of vehicle is commonly known as a 15 window deluxe. The 15 window was a factory option variant of the 23 window deluxe, I.E. it was specially ordered from the VW factory (M Code 130) without roof skylights or sunroof fitted.\n<br>In terms of scarcity, the 15 window deluxe is much much rarer than the 23 window deluxe.\n<br>Being a 59, it has all the nice features, bullet indicators at the front end and round rear tail/brake/indicator lights, solid bench seat, coat hooks, thin lip shelve, and ice pick door handles.\n<br>\n<br>The vehicle has been restored to a high specification. All rusty body panels have been replaced with the correct aftermarket repair panels, (Klassic Fab and Autocraft.) Once the welding was complete the bus was shot blasted underneath, etch primed, primed, seam sealed, stone chipped, and then given a lovely coating on 2K L53 Sealing Wax Red over the top.\n<br>Inside the missing dash pod was replaced, all the metal work bare metaled, and treated to some more L53.\n<br>The outside of the bus is meant to look original, and 80% of the paint work is. Where panels had been replaced, care was taken to blend in the welds, and cover with a colour almost matching the sun bleached L53. The parts of the outside without paint were, and are always covered in AnchorWax, and are regularly treated and buffed, (much to the looks of amazement of my neighbours watching me polish rust!)\n<br>The drive train and braking system has been updated and uprated, and is running some very nice items. It makes driving this bus safe, reliable, and fun!\n<br> \n<br>Once the metal and paint work was finished, the bus was given a full restoration. Everything that needed or could be to be replaced was, anything that was OE was removed cleaned, polished, restored, whatever it needed. New custom built 12V wiring loom, headlights, fuse boxes, switches, etc was fitted. Correct month and year speedo was found, sent to Pete Banks for restoration, and fitted. The correct month and year dash clock was fitted. The correct Blaupunkt head unit was sourced from Germany, and rebuilt to control the head unit hidden in the back.\n<br>New headlining from Wolfsberg West fitted, door cards trimmed, front seat trimmed, rear cushions trimmed by Trimming Tonic, in vinyl and fabric, fat biscuit stitch either side, depends if you’ve been the beach or sleeping! A bespoke oak, Devon replica interior was then built and fitted. Lots of storage including rear drawers, plenty of space for two to sleep with comfort. Early Easicool, gas stove, and water tank and tap fitted. Leisure battery, multiple 12V sockets, Propex heater, and mains hook up provide a comfy over-night camp.\n<br>\n<br>The running gear and engine was also given the once over with the best I could get. This thing stops and goes like a dream! Loads of power, great for cursing, and plenty of smiles.\n<br>For more info and all the things I’ve missed off, take a look at my build thread.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=65519&amp;start=195url\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">'59 15 Window Resto</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Engine:</strong>\n<br>2007cc.\n<br>AS41 Full flow case.\n<br>CB Performance, 5.5” VW journal H beam conronds\n<br>CB Performance, 78mm crank.\n<br>C.B. #1411-Wedge port heads/ported, polished 44x37.5\n<br>Engle FK8 cam.\n<br>Scat 1:1.4 followers.\n<br>CB Breather tower.\n<br>CSP Bell linkage (Best I’ve ever had)\n<br>Butty front accelerator linkage.\n<br>75A Alternator.\n<br>Twin 44’s.\n<br>Mahle 80.4 pistons B&amp;P.\n<br>Remote oil cooler and fan.\n<br>CB Performance Deep sump.\n<br>Firetec Engine bay extinguisher.\n<br>VW Speedshop Dual Muffler side exit stainless system. \n<br>All oil lines are stainless over braid hydraulic hoses with threaded pipe fittings, not barbs!\n<br>Remote filter head.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Gear Box &amp; Clutch:</strong>\n<br>Rancho Pro Street T1 IRS\n<br>0.82 4th gear\n<br>3.875 R&amp;P\n<br>Bay end plates added to box when built, so CV’s match.\n<br>Solid mount on poly buses.\n<br>Brand new drive shafts, CV’s etc.\n<br>Stage 1 plate with Daikin disc and Heavy Duty shaft kit\n<br>Gene Berg Shifter, and all new bushes on linkage.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Brakes and Suspension:</strong>\n<br>Franklins VW Werks 4” narrowed beam with adjusters\n<br>Dropped spindles\n<br>Porsche 944 front hubs, with vented cross drilled discs\n<br>Wilwood 4 pot calipers\n<br>Stainless Flexi-lines all around.\n<br>Creative IRS.\n<br>Futbus rear disc kit.\n<br>KYB front shocks, Type 2 Detective rear shocks.\n<br>Shortened and re conditioned steering box, inc lift.\n<br>CSP Dual circuit master cylinder.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Wheels and Tyres:</strong>\n<br>Flat4 Fuchs, 4.5” front, and 5.5” rear.
