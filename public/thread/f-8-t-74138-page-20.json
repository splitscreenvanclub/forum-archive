Both mine have cracks in the top RH corner...\n<br>I have repaired both. This one looks really good but the LH top corner is missing.. a piece about 1cm square. You cannot see it but the door on full travel has worn the very bottom of the channel. When the door gets to the very bottom it drops out of the channel... hence why they split and why the corner has broken off.\n<br>Going to fit two rubber door stops so door comes down to rest on these...Will reduce the drop by 1cm but door will not drop out...\n<br>Like I said...Very minor details..\n<br>OK it will not be OG ...\n<br>But will then function..\n<br>G",
