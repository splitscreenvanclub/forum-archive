    "content" : "At the moment it's just an idea so bear with me on this. \n<br>I was thinking of trying to organise a line-up of Canterbury Pitt buses at a show this year in recognition of these fantastic UK based conversions. I have spoken to one of the organisers of VW Action, which is 29th, 30th and 31st August and can very probably get an area within the show and shine allocated. I've never organised anything like this before so I'm making it up as I go along but who would be interested in getting their Pitts out for the boys (and girls) on Saturday 30th August? Obviously I don't want to tell them I can get 10 buses and only 1 turns up. Looking for an expression of interest at the moment and firm up how many in the next couple of months. \n<br>Stockers, ratters, slammers and s****ers all welcome \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee.",

Would be good to see a line-up, I hope you get some others on board. \n<br>\n<br>Keep up the good work,\n<br>regards,\n<br>Chris",
