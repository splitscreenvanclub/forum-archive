I took it apart but couldn't find anything broken, so I just fed some light oil (it was out of a spraycan so lighter than 3in1) down the speedo shaft where the cable attaches, trying to feed the oil in, it takes a while as its like a collet in a tube, but eventually it suddenly freed up, and I could spin it very easily by hand with the matchstick, put it all back together and its been perfect ever since \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
