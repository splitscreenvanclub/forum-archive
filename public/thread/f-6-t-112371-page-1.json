    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>I've currently got a 2\" narrowed CB Performance beam (at least that's what I think it is) but I don't think I can fit 3.5\" dropped spindles on without it being too low - I have got the beam up as high as it will go on the adjusters and want dropped spindles to improve ride quality.\n<br>\n<br>Just wondered if anyone has this combination &amp; how low it makes the front of the bus - a photo would be very useful.\n<br>\n<br>2.5 inch dropped spindles would be ideal. but i've heard that you can only get 3.5 inch drop (although I have seen some buses advertised for sale with 2.5 inch dropped spindles mentioned in the adverts?\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks.",

There's no need to cut and move the beam adjuster either as I can raise the beam adjuster for clearance (lowering the bus further) then get the exact height I want on coilovers.\n<br>\n<br>Happy days !",
