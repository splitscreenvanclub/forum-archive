    "content" : "Sounds like fairly solid progress, Lee. \n<br> \n<br> Ok, first day of the big bus week down. \n<br> \n<br> Shift rod installed. Wasn't expecting that to be as much of a pain as it was!! New bushes on, had to drop the beam slightly to get it in(?) Hooked it up to the hockey stick, couldn't fix it to the new front rod that arrived this morning as I was sent the rear coupling instead of the front one. Doesn't turn quite as easily as I'd expected, but we'll see...\n<br> \n<br> So, front beam back on, front shocks mounted, washer bottle fitted with new rubber cap \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> Clutch cable ran at long last!! Bracket made and fitted for a return spring on the accelerator pedal mechanism as the return is just shocking. \n<br> \n<br> Aand breathe.....\n<br> \n<br> New tank cleaned and painted and sender and new outlet fitted. Then went to make sure the tank strapps were ok and realised there is the end of a bolt sheared off in the body on one side. So had to drill that out. \n<br> \n<br> So, combine that with the usual hunting for stuff you've had lying round for years, but that disappears as soon as you need it, breaking drill bits and the wrong stuff in the post and that's day 1 gone. \n<br> \n<br> Tank in tomorrow. Hope those gears are ok, then it's time to throw the engine in. \n<br> \n<br> Oh, and I haven't booked the mot yet for fear of jinxing it...",

    "content" : "Knackered....\n<br> \n<br> Engine is in after clearancing the bellhousing. I thought it was a 12V box - still do, but it wouldn't go in without the flywheel catching the thicker sections at the top of the box. \n<br> \n<br> I think it needs to come out again though as the thing is solid now and I can't turn the engine by the crank pulley any more. more clearancing needed it seems.\n<br> \n<br> Also, the back end needs to come apart again as it definitely sits too low with the engine in, the spring plate stops need ground down too I reckon. So, perhaps a 1 inner spline rise. Pain in the arse as that means disconnecting the handbrake cables to get the axles off the spring plates. That back end has been apart and together so many times..... I might wait until I see what it does with the rear shocks on.\n<br> \n<br> Should get some goodies in the post today anyway.\n<br> \n<br> Oh and I think I have gears. Seems a little crunchy and massively more close together with the Hurst shifter on.\n<br> \n<br> I need to sort my electrics. There are loose wires all over the place as I haven't looked at it since before it went to the trimmers. Now when I connect the battery, it tries to turn the engine, without the key in.....hmm. Didn't do that last week.\n<br> \n<br> Oh well, here goes..... back in the garage.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Oh, and another thing. Does anyone know where to get longer panel clips? With 3mm ply door cards and vinyl on, the ones I got from Justaircooled \n<a href=\"http://www.justaircooled.co.uk/door-card-chrome-headed-door-card-clips.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.justaircooled.co.uk/door-car ... clips.html</a> aren't long enough.",

    "content" : "Well, project Stanford Hall is a little behind schedule, but still hopefully just possible.\n<br> \n<br> After a week of going up and down constantly on axle stands. I discovered that my gearbox needed a hell of a lot of clearancing to get the engine in, but it's in and spins free.\n<br> \n<br> Sad to say it sat a little too low at the back with the engine in, so I whipped it all apart again and got another inch of ride height. I suspect it will be a little impractical still on campsites, but we'll see.\n<br> \n<br> Not had the engine running yet as I went to hook the electrics up on sunday and realised I didn't have an oil pressure sensor and the fuel hose clips that SSVC spares had sent along with the hose were too small. I was dead chuffed to sort out a couple or really annoying electrical gremlins today. The indicators went solid with the ignition on and I had no speedo pod warning lights. Turned out I'd wired a live to the ground terminal on the speedo. All sorted now.\n<br> \n<br> My boss was asking about it today and suggested that I take tomorrow off to try and get it running, so that's the plan.\n<br> \n<br> Still no MOT booked, but I'll do that tomorrow.....\n<br> \n<br> So, anyway - here's a couple of in progress shots as it's all about the pics really.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.limejam.co.uk/images/bus/chocks.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.limejam.co.uk/images/bus/cramp.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> All that kept me going some days\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.limejam.co.uk/images/bus/hen.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> If I do make it to Vic Farm, please come say hello....",
