    "content" : "Personally, i think all the mistakes have been made by a ' restorer ' The rear lights may well be in the correct position for a 57, they weren't moved until they appeared on Dec 59 models and were actually moved 12mm outwards and 100mm downwards. The cab arches, poor choice by restorer ? Cargo Door hinges, were doors replaced by someone that didn't know the finer details ? Most of the choices made on this Bus have been poorly made but i question some comments, some good Buses have come out of Indonesia, i recall a recent Barndoor acquisition made by a Top restorer and bought as reccomended by a leader of the scene on here ?\n<br> \n<br> OK this Bus has many problems for the purist, and my main gripe is with everything that is incorrect its a LOT of money, but who is really to blame ?? Who sold the guy this Bus ? Who told him to put it up for sale for this amount of money ? and worst of all, who restored it ? Sunroof, no belly pans etc etc........ shouldn't we start asking the pertinent questions, and should we not start trying to help people get the best out of a restoration ??\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, its just an opinion, i wouldn't buy it and hopefully the buyer will understand why its not selling ?? regards, Magic \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",
