The bus is wearing its OG paint - Sea Blue and Blue White - nicely patina'd with some signs of old logos too. The Bus was imported by myself (originally an LA bus from the m-code). Has had minimal welding done to a very high standard - didnt have much rust to start with and is very solid. The bus is dry stored in a heated garage and only comes out in dry weather. Fully UK registered with age related plate (runs on US style plates) Passed MOT July just gone with no advisories so nearly a year to run \n<br>\n<br>Mechanically:\n<br>\n<br>Brake system completely gone through;\n<br>Busboys 4\" narrowed beam in the front fitted with dropped spindles, new track rods and drag link;\n<br>Raised steering box;\n<br>Straight axle rear end;\n<br>Brand new KYB GR2 lowered shocks all round; \n<br>15\" BRM wheels fitted with two week old Nankang 164/45/15 fronts and 195/65/15 rears with 4mm tread.\n<br>\n<br>AD code 1600 twinport motor with approximately 3,000 miles on it - also new alternator and clutch.\n<br>Has just had an original rebuilt German 34 pict 3 Solex carb fitted, brand new vacuum advance distibutor. \n<br>Single quiet pack exhaust fitted. \n<br>\n<br>6 popout windows (rubbers are dry and will need replacing but they suit the look and with it being dry stored and run I didnt want to replace), rear most seat is included - that and the cab seat have been recovered in some nice light Blue velour...! but i roll with a nice original Mexican blanket in the front and there is another seat from a late bay in there. Other than the seats there is nothing in the rear.\n<br>\n<br>This is a sweet looking bus with a really nice stance that got a ton of attention at the few shows it's been to.\n<br>\n<br>Price around Â£17,000 OBO\n<br>\n<br>Let me know if you'd like more pics. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Rich",
