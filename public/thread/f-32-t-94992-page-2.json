    "content" : "slammeddeluxe, I'm not suggesting that professional traders should be removed from site.\n<br>\n<br>My suggestion is that professional traders add the tag to their profile, if they don't, a mod/ admin could add the tag to their profile if discovered.\n<br>\n<br>maddison\n<br>\"BUT....this fella didnt sell it on here\"\n<br>\n<br>I know that, but he posed as a collector hiding his true intentions. I read quite a lot of ads and all sellers truly love their buses and some are fussy about who the bus is sold to. However, there is a current ad which someone spotted as a professional dealer.\n<br>\n<br>I don't believe that any traders are intending to rip anyone off. As I said above, it's the law, it's open and honest and protects buyers on the forum. I'm not about to spend Â£500 on a Ford Fiesta, but our entire life savings/ house deposit on potential lemon. I need to know that I have some legal protection before parting with a huge sum of money.",
