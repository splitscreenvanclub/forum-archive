Does anyone have and pics of the holder (or headlining in place?) How does the fix to the van? Does it sit on the lip?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Jim",

    "content" : "I do not intimately know the upper rear panels between the last row of windows on a 13 and the rear hatch BUT the issue I had was that I was fitting a thicker upper rear luggage trim panel..Plus I fitted OG VW cups and screws. This resulted in the unmolested rear table holder not fitting easily onto the cant rail, because it clashed with my cupped screws. I removed the cups because they were covered anyway...\n<br>If your is not trimmed and never fitted before I would trial fit and ensure that the wood does fit up to rail with a little room for the headlining fabric etc.\n<br>I will post pictures of fittings for overhead table.\n<br>It is very heavy when you try to keep up in the air and I was only aligning mine with existing holes.\n<br>Really a co-ordinated two person job..\n<br>I used some plastic boxes to rest it on in the centre so I could work on the outside to fit the screws.\n<br>Examine your holder to see where the OG holes were or if none replicate my positions.\n<br>Will post pics tonight..\n<br>G",

But anyhoo they fit OVER the headlining with about 6 screws each - which seems like a lot for a small item! and when the table holder is in place you can't see any of the screws!",
