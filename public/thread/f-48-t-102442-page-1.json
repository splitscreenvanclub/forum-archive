    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>I feel like a slight impostor as I don't have a split screen, I have a 73 bay, but it was originally a Canterbury Pitt conversion. \n<br>Recently purchased but unfortunately in transit the pop roof was blown off and damaged. Need to get a quote for fixing it if possible. I would prefer to replace but Im not sure I will find another roof like it as I believe its a Canterbury Pitt. \n<br>\n<br>Does anyone know where I could get another roof? or where I could get it fixed, and finished with original canvas?\n<br>\n<br>Please let me know If you can help so that I can get this sorted. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Matt\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=2819&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=2819&amp;t=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMAG1495.jpg\" title=\"IMAG1495.jpg (48.19 KiB) Viewed 273 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n    CP\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div>",

I've only ever seen a few pictures of the bay Pitt in a book and they're a proper rare beast. Are you going to VW Action at all? Or bugjam as I'd love to have a look at it in the flesh if you don't mind. Do you have any history at all. \n<br>Oh and good luck with the roof dude, as said anyone who works with fibreglass should be able to fix it for you and a sail maker can do you a set of bellows. \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee.",
