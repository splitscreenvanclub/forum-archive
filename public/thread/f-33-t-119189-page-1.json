    "content" : "Hmm, at the risk of stirring up a hornets nest I'll pass comment.....\n<br> \n<br> We were discussing exactly this at work the other day and came to the same conclusion. \n<br> Compare it to a recent case....Last month a typical Jeremy Kyle couple were, quite rightly, given custodial sentences for neglect. The phrase \"unfit moronic parents\" doesn't even come close. They left their 6 month old baby in the bath in a baby bath seat (as they said they'd done loads of times) whilst they were downstairs ripping a CD and having a beer with their equally Jeremy Kyle-esque friends. The baby managed to tip himself over a drowned \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> Who the f**k leaves a 6 month old baby alone for even a second, let alone when it's in the bath. These morons aren't fit to be parents. \n<br> Back to the Mccanns.......what type of person leaves their toddlers in a room whilst they go on the p**s in a bar/restaurant that's about 50 yards away \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> . And in a completely alien environment to what they're used to. If they'd have left the kids alone in the UK they would likely be looking a a neglect charge at the very least. I no longer think for one second they had anything to do with it, but I certainly think they sha some of the blame by leaving them in the first place. \n<br> Little Empi doesn't leave our sight unless he is with someone we trust implicitly and I fail to see how anyone could do any differently.",
