Unfortunately I don't have a lot of history, but most of the bodywork was done before my time, including adding second colour, and deluxe trim. If/when it needs a repaint I will probably go back to the original colour. I've been rebuilding all things mechanical over the last couple of years.\n<br>\n<br>The door strap is not standard by the easycool.
