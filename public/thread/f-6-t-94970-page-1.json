    "content" : "Crank shaft oil seal is at the back (as in the end nearest the front of the bus). It is common that they leak here but it wouldn't go over the exhaust, it would drip down between the engine and the gearbox via the bell housing. Do you mean it's leaking from behind the bottom pulley? \n<br> If you do then what type of bottom pulley do you have as some (all) of the el-cheapo chrome Chinese Sh!t ones that you get don't fit properly or the groove that's (badly) machined into them doesn't do it's job in stopping the oil leaking out. I run a scat bottom pulley and that's fine as are genuine OG vw ones. Before that I had an empi ally one that looked like it was made by a 2 year old from melted down bean cans and it leaked like a sieve. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee.",

    "content" : "9 to 1 Original GERMAN OE parts are better than 90% of aftermarket stuff (IMO), unless your engine is an exotic high power unit. I have an Â£80 crank pulley - complete waste of money and I'd rather go back to a vw one!\n<br> \n<br> Back to the original point - these type of symptoms come up so often, and I suffered with them myself. It's important to understand the original engine breather design (even, and especially on a modified from oe engine). I think it's called a pressurised case breather system ( even though it plumbs into the vacuum at the carb intake). Long and short of it, is people usually rush to upgrade the carb - even just the air filter - and in doing so remove the tube giving the case breathing it's vacuum, this upsetting the case pressure balance.\n<br> \n<br> The second important thing to understand is that there is actually an angular slot in the case behind the crank pulley. This is actually to allow air into the case, again as part of the original breather concept. On the original design an oil slinger is used her to keep the oil in the case. If your case pressure is even marginally high the oil will overcome the slinger behind the crank pulley and get onto the pulley.\n<br> \n<br> Net result: oil everywhere, misguided replacement and siliconing of gaskets on the fuel pump, distributor etc. ect.\n<br> \n<br> A sand seal will probably stop the oil coming out but won't address the underlying case pressure issue.\n<br> \n<br> If this sounds like the problem I'd suggest you look to get the case pressure balanced through either an OE or a considered breather system.",

I've fitted one of the cheapo empi breather boxes that connect to the filler neck then to each rocker cover and that's cured it. just make sure if you fit a breather box that it's positioned in the engine bay higher than where it comes off the engine so that it doesn't fill up with gunk.
