    "content" : "Hi all, last year i bought my keeper van.. pg/sg 58 or at least thats how i currently feel, famous last words hey! need to do some sound proofing\n<br>may go down the Noise Killer route, any thoughts on that would be greatly received. My main calling for help is regarding cloth headlining, ive a trimmer primed up to fit it i just need to supply the materials.... The only place ive spoke to who can supply me with such a lining is heritage, now thats great but....\n<br>1. 8week lead time on it.\n<br>2. white , grey , or cream. (dont really want either)\n<br>I did get a small swatch of material from the previous owner of what the van would of had as a liner, cant find it now mind!!\n<br>If i cant replicate its original colour, im thinking a brown or dark green.\n<br>Do i have to get this made from scratch or does anyone have an idea of somewhere else to try?\n<br>If i do have to get it bespoke, how much does that cost? \n<br>Questions questions....\n<br>Any thoughts on this would be appreciated\n<br>Regards Nige.",
