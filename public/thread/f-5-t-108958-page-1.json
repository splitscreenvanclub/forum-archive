    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>We`re looking for our first splitty to use as a weekend driver/full camper. Don`t mind taking on a project but we are novices and wary of biting off more than we can chew. A blank canvas/empty interior is fine as we have lots of ideas of how we`d want to fit it out. We are thinking 11/13/15 windows and are open to the idea of German or Brazilian buses.\n<br>We are fully prepared to do work on the bus but will be over time as monthly funding allows. We`re really thinking the budget would be ~Â£500/month ongoing to bring the bus up to scratch and not in any particular hurry.\n<br>\n<br>Budget wise we`re looking at 10-12K but could push a little further for the right bus. Likewise the Brazilian project we missed on the SSVC facebook page at 5K would have been doable too (as would have left a decent budget chunk for more significant work).\n<br>\n<br>Anyone have anything of interest? We are based in Stockport/Manchester but would be willing to travel.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Rich and Anna.",
