    "content" : "Miles\n<br> \n<br> Probably best to get some advice from experience rather than a book so here goes....\n<br> \n<br> - I find it easier to remove the engine with rear bumper and valence removed. Can be done with rear bumper in place but why make matters harder for yourself!\n<br> \n<br> - disconnect battery and it can stay put, it doesn't have to be removed.\n<br> \n<br> - remove air filter assembly completely (if original style is fitted)\n<br> \n<br> - disconnect wiring from coil, carb choke, oil pressure switch and alternator/Dynamo labelling as you go along. You will find that some wiring stays on the coil and does not need to be undone. Tuck the wiring loom to one side of the engine bay clear of the engine.\n<br> \n<br> - undo accelerator cable and push cable through the fan housing (it won't go through completely but that doesn't matter).\n<br> \n<br> - crawl under the bus and remove the heater cables to the heat exchangers andpull away the heater pipes at the top. Again pipes don't need to be removed just loose fit so there is no resistance when you pull the engine out. You may need to jack the bus up a bit at this point depending how low your bus is or how fat you are (I need a bit of height clearance!).\n<br> \n<br> - whilst you are under the bus remove the left hand bolt to the engine, it is a bit of a bugger to undo as the head is tucked up by the top of the gearbox but patience and a good ratchet kit will get it eventually plus eight arms and twelve fingers!\n<br> \n<br> - back up top reach behind the fan housing and undo the right hand side 17mm nut for the second engine bolt. The engine will be supported now by the bottom two bolts so time to get the jack and wooden support under the sump plate of the engine.\n<br> \n<br> - lightly support the engine with the jack, no need to get the bus up in the air it is just there as a safety net for now.\n<br> \n<br> - back under the bus remove the last two 17mm nuts on the bottom of the gearbox holding the engine in place. \n<br> \n<br> - back up top raise the jack up a bit more to make sue it is firmly supporting the engine.\n<br> \n<br> - reach each side of the fan housing or use the exhaust and wiggle the engine while pulling forward you will feel it move towards you on the jack. Keep wiggling and moving it towards you and you will feel it come off the gearbox.\n<br> \n<br> - it is now only on the jack so move it towards you and then use a bit of common sense and adjustment of the level of the Jack to bring it through the rear of the bus. Ideally you want the jack at a low setting as it makes it more stable to handle.\n<br> \n<br> I have probably forgotten something so I am sure that someone will chip in or possibly tell you a slightly different order but this guide will essentially get the job done.\n<br> \n<br> Dr. G \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

There will be a bolt with a 17mm spanner head going into that. That bolt can be undone and removed. \n<br> \n<br> On the offside will be the starter motor. The lower fastening for this is a nut on a stud and the upper may or may not have the half moon type head on the starter side of the bellhousing. If it's the former you just need a 17mm spanner on the nut behind the fanshroud. Remove the nut and you're done. Even if it is the latter I'd try just to loosen the nut on it's own without trying to get a spanner/socket on the bolt head - you may find that the bolt stays put enough to allow this.",
