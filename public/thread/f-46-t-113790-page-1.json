    "content" : "Chaps, I need your help!\n<br>\n<br>I ordered a full new set of cushions from J&amp;S back In the summer. I was expecting them about a month ago but I called today and Joanne needs some measurements. My bus has the same rear drawers as pictured here: (not my van - apologies for borrowing the pic!)\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/IMG_1546_zps6av4o0ps.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/IMG_1546_zps6av4o0ps.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>From what it appears the engine cushion doesn't completely 'fill' the gap. Is this correct? I had planned on my daughter sleeping on there and can see her getting wedged down the side \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> If it is, does anyone know the correct measurements?\n<br>\n<br>Also, the cushion over the easicool.... I've searched numerous threads. I'm not sure if the 'top' is original. According to trimshack it should be either tied on or as a base the cushion slips onto. This is mine:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/Mobile%20Uploads/65EDB4A7-61BC-4D3E-9228-01D6ED6DE3B9_zpsrmtyzddc.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/Mobile%20Uploads/65EDB4A7-61BC-4D3E-9228-01D6ED6DE3B9_zpsrmtyzddc.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/Mobile%20Uploads/53068DC5-336C-4954-8D14-A976F5E5AB9C_zps0bbzcd26.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/Mobile%20Uploads/53068DC5-336C-4954-8D14-A976F5E5AB9C_zps0bbzcd26.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>If anyone can shed any light i'd appreciate it.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Scott",

    "content" : "Well I had the same issues..with Peebles. \n<br>That picture came from me and is of a 1962/3 Caravette with rear drawers.\n<br>I downloaded it when that van was for sale on eBay. \n<br>I saved them for the cupboard drawer sink info..\n<br>I do know that as the models changed the depth of the rear drawers....front to back ....changes. \n<br>The one shown claimed to be original. I do not believe it is...I reckon this rear cushion was made the later wide hatch width for a leg cupboard hence the gap...\n<br>My March 62 Devonette has acquired a set of drawers...has a full width seat back and the drawers will go right up to the back of the seat back. ..no cross van table leg cupboard...\n<br>As shown in that picture..\n<br>I also wanted the cushion to \"fill the space\" for my offspring...\n<br>Peebles is a September 1964 so 1965 MY interior.\n<br>I also have a 1965 Caravette with OG interior.\n<br>I was also asked by Joanne for rear cushion size because they DO vary.\n<br>I measured my 1965 OG but I wanted it to fill the space...so asked for it to be wider and to be deeper front to back.\n<br>Mine is a tad too big...front to back because I did not allow for the fact the cushion is 4\"deep and new and full and I did not allow for the slope of the back.\n<br>It fits snug and no chance of infant slipping down the gaps so I am happy. ..\n<br>I would suggest to mock up the size and maybe use some cushions to simulate with the cushion against the back and measure the sizes.\n<br>My easicool cover is also not ideal..and I am going to have to adjust the foam depth but will get there..",
