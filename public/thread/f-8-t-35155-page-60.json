The reason for the heaters was that the gearstick rod was frozen solid and surrounded by ice the whole length of the van and we were leaving in 30 minutes from when i found it was stuck so all the heaters and a ladies hairdryer were installed under it to free it up. -14 degrees i heard that night..\n<br> \n<br> Chiselling lumps of ice off the bottom using screwdrivers next to my new paint did make me wince a little though \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> .\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for the pictures Mike - was such a great time, i will post a few when i have sorted them out.\n<br> \n<br> Mark",
