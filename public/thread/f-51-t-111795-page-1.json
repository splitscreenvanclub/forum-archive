The preious owner also thought it would be a good idea to cover every single last bit of interior with a thick shag pile carpet, its was very well glued and screwed in, i have since removed this, leaving only a small scrap in the cab for fun and to remind me of how crackers this old school hippo was! She did also have a repaint in the states a very long time ago in red, but i am about 50 hours into scraping it all off, i have block sanded a few test patches, it has plenty of patina and i have gotten a good shine on it in the places i have experimented with. It also has had a replacement front clip in the states a very long time ago, its been done to a pretty good standard and has certainly lasted the test of time, thats why the front panel was different colour up front. It is virtually 80% original paint, the only filler the van has is in the rear quarter, i plan to scrape this out, polish and leave it with the minor dent the bond was meant to cover up. apart fro that there is nothing else to hide with the body work, it has some dents and scrapes on it, but i love it like that. it also had a factory eberspatcher heater installed which the hole is still present, (which i have temp sealed up to avoid fumes) i had planned to keep my eye out for one and put a heater back in. Also one of the jobs on my hit list is to change the front shift rod and install bushes as currently there are not any bushes!!\n<br>\n<br>so there you have it, this is a ratty looking patina'd van with nothing to hide, its MOT exempt, and also believed to be of only a few in production for a one month only period, due to its chassis number, bumpers, and colour. Its gonna be tough to let go of this, but if it doesn't sell by the time i move house, ill put it in the garage of my new house (where it will actually fit in!!) and gradually knock off random jobs on it over time. Ive spent a fortune on this getting the stance right, and making it better to drive and being family safe. Its not rotten and is ready to go. its not prefect by a long shot, but it is what it is. i won't go on about how I've justified the price or anything because anyone looking for a pre 60 split will know the market. i'd like Â£22K Ono its located in newport pagnell, and anyone is welcome to come and take a look. I also don't mind helping ship this anywhere in Europe if you need it.\n<br>\n<br>i'll bet i have forgotten some bits to this, as I've wrote all this in one sitting, so i'll update with bits if i need to. This is the only place i am going to advertise my bus, so if the ad is still here, its still for sale. Drop me a pm if you want my mobile number, or have any questions about it.\n<br>\n<br>cheers\n<br>\n<br>Austin\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/43f0d5cf470a23538e604bf931190aba.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/80fab8575eef8e9200c989f5c11ab779.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/507a6953f91a10a362cf5aa2c4ca648f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/ed2fac6281d5ecb68136d2db018c80ca.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/1cf0f492c1f7bc2a1cdafed371208bed.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/6fc4aaae33328dcca7233b285e4a55e7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/644779b7cf1f5510ddaa170c8af994e9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/07/31/ce564b2f6482eb4a3199f5900c30fe90.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
