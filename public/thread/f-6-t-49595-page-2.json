    "content" : "Hi everyone, my names Jay. I joined SSVC back in august but have only just got round to buying my christmas prezzie (after lots of searching).......May I introduce Dylan !!! I brought him from a friend of a friend. With limited history to hand, I am very keen to find out more about my new family member. As far as I know he's a Brazillian import, obviously 15 window, LHD, 1962. I have a fair bit of history which I intend to translate sooner rather than later. I was excited to find a forum dedicated to these lovely buses, I hope you guys can help me out ??? Any info would be great. A big thanks in advance. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_compress.gif\" alt=\":compress:\" title=\"compress\"> Ive tried to post a pic a few pics but to be honest im not sure what I have to do ?? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",

    "content" : "Hey Jay, welcome to SSVC \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>I too have been trying to do some research into the Brazilian manufacture however info is pretty limited! \n<br>\n<br>A small amount Ive got: (translated, hence poor grammar!)\n<br>\n<br>• Volkswagen do Brasil Ltda. is a subsidiary arm of Volkswagen Group, established in 1953.\n<br>• In the beginning - just like the Beetle - only german cars were sold in Brazil.\n<br>• In Brazil In June 1957 the first vehicle manufactured by Volkswagen Brazil made the production lines in Sao Bernardo do Campo, in Sao Paulo state. The percentage of nationalization of our van was 50%.The first models were just like the germans. \n<br>• In 1961 came the six-port model, in two versions: Standard and Luxury. The gearbox was already full and the relationship of synchronized gearbox 1,26:1 spent. The nationalization index reached 95%. Two years later he had the Van versions, Standard, Special and Tourism. In the last three models there was variation in the interior trim, with differentiated tissues, roof lining, seats with handles, etc.. Outside, two-tone paint, hubcaps, trim, steps to facilitate access and choice of 15 windows. This year had already sold 14,430 vans.\n<br>• Part of that success was due to the fact that there is no similar product on the market. His closest competitor was the Rural, Willys-Overland, and from 1965 Chevrolet Veraneio more expensive than both. But not many places do not offer a fuel consumption as measured on the van, because they used large six-cylinder engines.\n<br>• The biggest changes in the model later were the introduction of 15 Windows as standard and Overrider-bumpers. in Brazil was a Transporter, Singlecab and 15-window-bus as Luxo and Standard available. The Crewcab and Samba was not sold in Brasil. Until the end of Production in 1975, the brazilian T1-Bus was pretty much the same as the german model from 1963\n<br>• In 1967, Manning reached the van, a strange version of six ports, two for each row of seats. There is still providing services to a hotel in Aguas de Lindenow, SP.\n<br>• In the same year were introduced pickup version and a more powerful engine, the entire line, with 1493 cm3 (83 x 69 mm) and 44 hp at 4,200 rpm, and 12-volt electrical system. The new body had a bucket with 5 m2, and the three sides were open, which facilitated much loading. And there was still below, as in a German magazine. The payload for the truck and the van, went to 845 kg. For the driver had individual bank and windshield wiper with two speeds.\n<br>• In 1970 the factory offered as an option, the locking differential. By means of a lever at the base of the seat, the driver could override the action of the differential. It was a special satellite box with a sleeve hitch to eliminate the relative motion of two planets. In addition to enabling better traction on very slippery road conditions, as in mud, was useful in cases of a rear wheel stay in the air when trying to go sideways on the sidewalk, in which the suspension is distended throughout, very common in the van.\n<br>\n<br>And as a little treat a nice Brazilian production video:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=401599&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=40&amp;sid=19dbbbff77cfe7f65550773041202662\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/forum/viewtopic.php?t=401599&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=40&amp;sid=19dbbbff77cfe7f65550773041202662</a>\n<br>\n<br>Look forward to seeing some pics of your 15 window! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Please see \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=74266&amp;hilit=+upload+photos\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=74266&amp;hilit=+upload+photos</a> for help on uploading pictures\n<br>\n<br>Terry",
