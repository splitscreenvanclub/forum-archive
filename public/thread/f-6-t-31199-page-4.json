    "content" : "Hi been reading up on fitting seatbelts in my bus. Like your method of fitting the upper mount but cant find the bar/mountvthat you used. Any advise? Where can i get them ? uote=\"marmite_on_toast\"]\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Pictures and details supplied by Reaction</span>\n<br>\n<br>I fitted a 3 point into my 67. There was none of the fabled factory made mounting points though \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The centre points. I need to fit the longer belt ones though. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v734/Toughplum/1e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>This is where I mounted the rear inertia reel. Not too bad to fit here either. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v734/Toughplum/1d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v734/Toughplum/1c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I've used JK spreader plates behind all mounting points. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v734/Toughplum/1b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I opted for a single mount point here. I think I'll go back at it later and split them up. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v734/Toughplum/1a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n   where did you get the belts from \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n  Not advisable, but I purchased them on eBay. They specifically have to be mounted upright to work properly (by this I mean they stay locked and wind in only until you get upright position). These particular belts are from a Renault kangoo, which I checked to for length first. \n  <br>\n  <br>They cost about 20 bob, which is far cheaper than buying new, but they need to be thoroughly looked over before fitting. Don't want any 'accident used' items protecting my boys. \n  <br>\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Or\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n   from VW Heritage - they do the ones that mount on their side, are extra long, and you can get them with classic style flippy catches. \n  <br>\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">The following details have been supplied by pootle</span>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>When I fitted rear belts I tried to copy modern car set ups with regards to hip/shoulder points so that when it comes time to move up to the next child seat or an adult is traveling in the back the belts are positioned correctly.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0817.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0826.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0824.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0848.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0820.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n112/pootleposieperkin/IMG_0819.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n  I have supplied these images to show other forum users the modifications i have carried out on my own van.

So need to sort out mounting points and belts. Unfortunately as usual on a budget but this is safety so must be right cost regardless",

    "content" : "If you look on the securon website it gives you all the different styles of belt and buckle combinations they do with pictures. It also gives the length of the belts so you can work out which ones you need. \n<br>I bought an un-branded belt from ebay and frankly it was shocking. The belt itself was very thin material, the metal anchor points looked like they were made from an old baked bean can and the stitching looked like a 5 year old had done it with some left-over bits of cotton. I replaced it with a securon one and you can see the difference in quality immediately. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
