(Blatant plug: I have NOS motors,#4 in diagram, a frame, #8 in diagram, the rest is easily obtainable). That way you have the \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">correct</span> set up for the year of your Bus. The '61 motors were of course 6 volt , but new 12 volt armatures are readily available from the usual suspects (circa £42). It is an easy 3 minute job to change the armature. The motor is however single speed.\n<br> You might with some messing around get the '67 set up to fit, but on the other hand you could sell it to finance what I've outlined above.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1127962.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1091852.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
