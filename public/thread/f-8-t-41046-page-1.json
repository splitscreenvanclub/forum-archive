    "content" : "I was lucky enough to find my 67 13 window about 2 years ago, Ade from Boxwagen in Poole imported it from the states in about 2000. When I got it , it had been IRS'd, running on empi 5's &amp; had a basic Bus furniture interior, the engine had been upgraded to a 1776 with single carbs. \n<br>[img][img]http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/torquayapril06125.jpg[/img] \n<br>[/img]\n<img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/torquayapril06129.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>Since I've had it I've rebuilt the engine added twin 36's, stainless exhaust, new shocks alround &amp; few more bits.
