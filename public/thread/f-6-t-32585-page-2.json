Failing that get an adjustable one and us a micrometer, if you have one, to get the size spot on with your arms, as these will more than likely be slightly different in size.\n<br> Make sure you use some sort of cutting compound for a spot on size. If you dont it could cut the hole oversize and you will be in the same situation as before. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
