I was woken as we pulled onto the drive by my wife saying \"where's the Bus !\". After throwing a number of F##ks into the now, bare driveway, and explaining afterwards the necessary use of swear words to my 10year old son, I called the Police who were helpful but not positive about the return of my beloved bus.<br><br>I called the only people I can truly rely on in a crisis... My Friends <br>A special thanks to Tim, Pad, Jon, Richie &amp; Jen, Dave, Jay, Glen, Scouse, and all the VW friends out there keeping watch both here and abroad.<br><br>I've owned her for 8 years and restored her, happy holidays, shows and the coolest wedding car a groom could wish for! <br><br>I can only describe It as feeling like a member of the family has gone missing, with your help there's hope for her return. many many thanks, <br><br>Richard, Carrie and Dylan X <br><br>P.S note to self :- Before buying shiny things for your Bus Or Bug invest in a big Shiny Alarm or Tracker Device the best you can afford !! </span>",
