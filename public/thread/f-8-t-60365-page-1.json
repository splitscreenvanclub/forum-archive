    "content" : "Word to the SSVC. Me and my wife are now the proud owners of a 15 window Brazillian split.\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><br><span style=\"color: #40FFFF\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">The story</span></span> </span></span>\n<br>I am a wood monkey by trade but have always loved cars (especially VW's) always dreamed from a young age of owning a splitty. I moved permanently to Oxfordshire 4 years ago to be with my now wife, i did not know many people. On an off chance I stumbled into a world of custom vw's....... and have never looked back since!\n<br>\n<br>My wife and I have been together for 9 years and got married 5 months ago, we didn't need anything material so asked for donations too our camper fund if our guests wanted to give us a gift. On Tuesday 27th October Myself, Ross and Ginga took a road trip after work to collect and pay (pretty much every penny we had) for a Brazillian 15 window split I got off-a Ebay. Un-seen by the way!\n<br>\n<br>With a little guidance from my mentor and a little help from my friends i'm going to turn this bus into something real nice.\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #40FFFF\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">What i need</span></span></span></span>\n<br>I'm pretty good with the old metal now; after helping other people out and customing my caddy so i think i got that side covered. But i could do with some advice on finding out a bit more on my van. And has anyone got any insider info on restoring Brazillian vans?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers",

This is my first venture into forums and threads and ting so please hold tight.\n<br>\n<br>I realise this van needs a full resto, i'll be doing the jobs to get it MOT'd and registered then having it as a rolling resto. I have no garage of my own but use the club's HQ on wednesday evenings and Saturday afternoons. \n<br>\n<br>This poor old vans been used as a propper off road transit van in Brazil- for muchos years! The chassis rails were full of compacted dust. The outriggers have rotted and not been repaired so pillars have started to drop effecting door shuts and the gutters. The floor looks like its had 1000 engines transported thousands of miles on it. And it has had a front and rear shunt affecting the off side front door shuts and also the curvature on the o/s rear quater.\n<br>\n<br>To get it to the MOT.\n<br>\n<br>rear lenses.\n<br>Top hats all round\n<br>Outriggers all round\n<br>inner cills\n<br>Floor.\n<br>Brakes all round\n<br>\n<br>As this will be a rolling project i'm planning to save money the do a few jobs which are connected at the same time. Seems like the smart thing to do.

This means that the parts you need are not always specific to the year of manufacture. \n<br>\n<br>For example, the B-pillars in my bus (and probably yours too!) are much earlier barn door pillars. You will probably have early cab doors and old high hinge cargo doors.... the list is endless. Finding the correct part is not always very easy. There are plenty of helpful folk around though!\n<br>\n<br>Look forward to following your story. If you start a thread in the rides and projects section we can all follow the build.\n<br>\n<br>Which reminds me....
