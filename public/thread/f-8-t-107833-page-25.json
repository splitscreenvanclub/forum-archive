The two OG ones were hidden anyway by the headlining ..and the rail..\n<br>\n<br>In the initial posted pictures on the web and added pictures I received of Sherry the mirror seemed to sit very high and be mounted so the top edge was in line with the surface of the airbox.. and looked like this...\n<br>Maybe the initial owner was a very tall (long bodied) person...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/304c5b446e1673db8bb286dd8e1ba090.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/623cf67f5cc3114dd4c67e650ff83df1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/b289f18045fb9dd1ea95b8d9aec92159.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So on strip down..\n<br>I noted ...curtains were hung by stretchy curtain wires attached to protruding rivet heads coming out of the side panels.\n<br>There are stretchy wires down the side panels and one across the bus between the B posts so that the sleeping area is private from the cab area backwards. \n<br>\n<br>Sherry will have thermo mats and blackout round the screen anyway so that the cab area can be used for children on an upper westy style bench seat cot and bench seat base.\n<br>There was no silentgliss curtain around the front windscreen on a Devonette..\n<br>Designed to be a cheap model you see...\n<br>\n<br>But wait..\n<br>There were no mirror screw holes in the centre pillar at all.\n<br>\n<br>I knew Sherry had been repainted in a Turkis lower and a VW white on the top half and suspected the holes had been welded up or filled..\n<br>I stripped the paint off but..found\n<br>NO.. no mirror holes in the centre windscreen post at all.\n<br>But there was a mirror fitted..\n<br>\n<br>A non standard mirror which was screwed up into the peak..\n<br>\n<br>STRANGE..\n<br>\n<br>I took pictures of the non standard mirror fitted and mused...\n<br>\n<br>I did find that panel vans were supplied without internal mirrors if they had a cab division fitted...Logical if there was a load on the back the centre mirror is not much use..\n<br>Not sure what the MOT says now..\n<br>I have also found that some kombi models may also not had mirrors.\n<br>There does not appear to be an m code to either add or remove the internal mirror.\n<br>The m codes on Sherry seem normal ones..\n<br>Will have to recheck..\n<br>\n<br>I was reminded of this when I found the photos of the fitted mirror.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/2befaf456c1c1a546b7cd83f9f220a07.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/86dcd7d31278de92b2b5b22e2a77aefd.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>But then I found an identical mirror fitted to Paigey's 1960 windowed bus...\n<br>I took pictures..\n<br>This is identical and with better lighting you can see the style...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/1450586a5b867cab306d405e2ff09a01.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160507/f4364b5fe8ba4c5e5a7de2df9df18d5d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So I was puzzled..\n<br>Looks like as originally supplied the March 1962 microbus ordered by Devon had no mirror and a PO fitted one..\n<br>At first I thought it had been swapped because mine had a larger mirror and an even larger clip on mirror added.\n<br>\n<br>In my stash I have a VW OG one age perfect to fit..\n<br>Anyone have this experience?\n<br>\n<br>Anyone else seen this style?\n<br>\n<br>Clymoj?\n<br>What did your Devonette ( brother to mine) have?",
