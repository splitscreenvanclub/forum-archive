Label each of the connections with tabs of masking tape. Group connections together based on where they go (wires to go to the speedo pod, wires to go to the fuse box, wires to go to the left lights, right lights etc.).\n<br> \n<br> Then start plugging them in, one group at a time.\n<br> \n<br> Eat the elephant one bite at a time.",
