I swear it's all psychological as I desperately want it done but every time I go near it I make an excuse not to work on it.\n<br>So I have basically booked some time off next week with the intention of getting it running.. I truly think if I can drive it then I'll be motivated to finish all the bits, install my cool interior, then I'll need a cool trailer so I'll finish that then rear extension called a Puck and all will be good.\n<br>If anyone's around this weekend/next week and fancies Helping you would be very welcome!",
