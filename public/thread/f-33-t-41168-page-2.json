If someone advertises something and there are obvious (to knowledgeable people) errors/misrepresentations then if I was a potential buyer I'd like to know. However I agree that a lot of replies on for sale ads are pointless and annoying.\n<br>\n<br>I suppose if replies are blocked on for sale ads then the potential buyer can start a new thread asking peoples opinions about the item on the for sale thread. But then you might get multiple threads all about the same ad.....and buyers will still find those threads as well.....",

Do people still spend this type of money on things without getting someone in the know to go look at it or at least ask around? \n<br>\n<br>I think all the adverts should be sellers first post only and then can only be edited by the seller. \n<br>\n<br>It will stop sifting through 3 pages to see any details you may need to know. \n<br>\n<br>Keep forum data down, pages will load up faster on my rubbish mobile! \n<br>\n<br>And will stop Pointless bitching!
