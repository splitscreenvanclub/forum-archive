Unless any unforseen events happen mine is going no where, it cost to much to go through the rebuild process again, its the colour I like and my son loves it.\n<br>\n<br>Yes it probably only appeals to a small amount of people, but judging by the amount of attention it gets it might not be to hard to sell. Plus for those not in the scene it is RHD.\n<br>\n<br>Mine needed so many new panels/doors + it had been overpainted so there was no patina or original paint left. \n<br>\n<br>I also think people view vans differently to other classic cars, would I paint a E-Type, P6 or MK2 a different colour from original, definately not.\n<br>\n<br>But then having thought of some yank custom muscle cars, well......",
