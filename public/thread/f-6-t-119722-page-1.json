However, opening the windows is so hard that I've broken catches before. This week I was told this is because my seals are the wrong way round. Before I change them all can someone confirm?\n<br> \n<br> Ignore the red circle I've just borrowed the photo from elsewhere. \n<br> \n<br> Thanks",

    "content" : "Fair play, I've just tried it the other way around and it is so much better in terms of opening and closing and the seals still look good. It would be helpful to confirm however as I suspect there are many of us that have had the same thoughts and issues. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
