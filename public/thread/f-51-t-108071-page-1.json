I've now decided the time has come for me to give up on this restoration project as I'm not getting any younger.\n<br>\n<br>So up for grabs is my 2nd Luv;\n<br>\n<br>For those who want a 100% original Campervan that is now a 48yr old classic that still needs a little more TLC for it to survive for another 23 years.\n<br>\n<br>Over the past years I have spent an immense amount of time effort and money resurrecting this bus to beyond its former glory and I have achieved this to a certain degree;\n<br>\n<br>Sadly age and ill health have dictated against me completing this task.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Priced to sell at 14K. I am willing to haggle but please no day dreamers and no spare part scavengers, sensible offers only</strong>\n<br>\n<br>I am also willing to negotiate the price if a decent motd 60s Beetle is part of the deal.\n<br>\n<br>London Based South West area\n<br>\n<br>Email address: \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:rgbargee@btinternet.com\">rgbargee@btinternet.com</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>Tel: \n<img src=\"http://chocksaway.com/camper/number.gif\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>-------\n<br>\n<br>11 Window 4 berth Campervan\n<br>\n<br>Lots of restoration done over the years.\n<br>\n<br>Repaired or replaced many panels including:\n<br>\n<br>Sill on Side panel\n<br>front and rear wheel arches\n<br>Rear corners/ Battery and Platform trays\n<br>Cab floor repair/ both front windscreen repair panels\n<br>Bottom section for Front panel inner and outer + posts\n<br>Both Cab door-windows repaired and all rubber seals etc have been replace, this however was done several years back and leaks are starting to appear.\n<br>Fitted Aluminium pop-out windows with all new seals.\n<br>\n<br>Throughout most of the years with me the Bus has been parked outside in the elements, so the body/paint/panel-work is looking a bit distressed.\n<br>\n<br>The Rear Cargo door Window seals have been replaced in the last 2 years;\n<br>\n<br>This and the Side cargo doors are showing signs of rot/rust but are still structurally sound and in good working order.\n<br>\n<br>The underneath is solid and well maintained (cover skid/plate removed but is included). (See photo pic)\n<br>\n<br>------\n<br>\n<br>Almost every window and body seals have been replaced with spares purchased from Alan H. Schofield who also supplied most of the Body Panels.\n<br>\n<br>All the Seals and Panels that are not already fitted are included as spares and are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>Roof vent\n<br>Dormobile roof seal\n<br>Side window seals\n<br>Engine-lid seal\n<br>Front door seal\n<br>Vent up seal\n<br>Rear axle boot kit\n<br>Roof window seal\n<br>Side cargo door seals (9 in Total).\n<br>Also 2x Cargo door bottom skins (panels).\n<br>MOTd in August 2014\n<br>\n<br>Both King Pins were, replaced supplied by\n<br>\n<br>A H. Schofield.\n<br>\n<br>(MOT Advisory: underside welding is going to require further work due to poor quality)\n<br>\n<br>Front Suspension and running gear has been repaired or replaced over the years.\n<br>\n<br>Fitted HD Anti-Rollbar 3 years ago,\n<br>\n<br>Refurbished Steering Box fitted several years ago (original included)\n<br>\n<br>Upfront fitted 2 x original wheels and tyres\n<br>\n<br>Rear 2 x ENKEI Dish 5/205 5.5â€x15â€ (fitted with lock nuts).\n<br>\n<br>2 x Original Wheels with low profile tyres (Not fitted but included)\n<br>\n<br>------\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>MOTOR</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Original Air Cooled Engine with only 68,172 miles on the clock\n<br>\n<br>12 volt 1500cc single port\n<br>\n<br>The Distributor, alternator, fuel pump and Carburettor/Manifold have been upgraded. (originals available)\n<br>\n<br>The main fuel line has been replaced with metal braided hose. Fitted a Bugpack single quiet pack Exhaust.\n<br>\n<br>A very reliable and well maintained engine.\n<br>\n<br>EMPI Hurst Style shifter fitted (original gear stick +included) Gear selector rods and parts overhauled in the last 18 months.\n<br>\n<br>------\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>INTERIOR</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Complete and original Devon caravette interior with Dormobile roof conversion, which is in reasonable condition, although both Roof vents are cracked and the mechanisms faulty all the roof seals have been replaced and they remain water tight.\n<br>\n<br>Also included is the original awning with its accessories which appear a bit tatty but I've never had an occasion to open them out and use them.\n<br>\n<br>All original Cushion covers and Curtains, some with water stain marks but all in fairly good condition.\n<br>\n<br>The Cab Seats and all interior panels, Mats and Flooring have aged but are still in good nick.\n<br>\n<br>The Headliner is almost flawless with only a 1 inch rip in it.\n<br>\n<br>The Cooker and Cool box are not installed but are included (see photo pics).\n<br>\n<br>The Steering Wheel was restored several years ago but now is showing signs of wear but is still solid.\n<br>\n<br>------\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Not so good Stuff:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Suspect rain water entering vehicle from front windscreen sill area.\n<br>\n<br>The roof guttering channel area over the windscreen is rusty and needs attention\n<br>\n<br>NS rear corner and wheel arch panels have dents and damage to the area that need repairing, the OS also has similar needs. (See photo pics)\n<br>\n<br>The Wiper motor occasionally operates erratically and squeaks but does return to normal operation when switched on and of repeatedly;\n<br>\n<br>It was repaired 4 to 5 years ago when the motor bushes were replaced.\n<br>\n<br>The rear Cargo door and the Side cargo doors are showing signs of rot/rust but are still structurally sound and in good working order (See photo pics).\n<br>\n<br>Recently I have noticed that the Rear of the vehicle is swaying especially on deceleration and braking.\n<br>\n<br>------",
