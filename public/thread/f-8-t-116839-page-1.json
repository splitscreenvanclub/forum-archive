    "content" : "Here goes, hi all, a few years ago I bought a '65 after not a lot of hunting.\n<br> After selling my modified t4 and getting a t5, we went to a vw show to get parts to hop up the t5. Not having much luck in finding what I liked, the boss (wife) said she fancied a splitty!\n<br> Not a chance was the reply she got, I could never afford one of those! Being an ex panel beater/painter she said to find a project. Even then I was sceptical.\n<br> The next day my mate said have you looked on uk barn finds on Facebook. First thing that popped up was a 65 split with a lot of panels. Clicked on link and it was 5 mins away, bearing in mind we live in the arse of the world, it was meant to be! This story bring me to now, 2 1/2 yrs later ( ironman wales training lost me a year) , back into the garage when time allows.\n<br> Please feel free to abuse me if I stop, motivation needed.\n<br> Cut off front panel, new n/s front chassis leg fitted and other front parts needed. \n<br> Started on cargo floor this morning ready to fit two outriggers, centre section and front top hat.\n<br> Wish my garage was dry as I'd get her blasted if it was.\n<br> Didn't use the top hat or outrigger it came with as they were very thin compared to autocraft parts. Want it strong for my kids safety.\n<br> Hopefully more to come soon.....",
