As there wasnt much in the way of metal by the bit near the front closing panel i did a hatchet job and then used a bit of plate held in with (if i remember) silicone sealer just so i'd have something to load the filler onto \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> yeah, i know.....but it was just a tempo repair so i dont feel too guilty about it, plus i wasn't in a position to remove the interior to get it welded up....\n<br>Anyhow, this was all cut out and the surrounding bit in the closing panel was cut out as well.\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/10.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>this is the bit that would have required removing the interior. we use the bus so much and i didnt want it off the road too long so i didnt have time to strip it out hence the tempo job\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/11.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>into the closing panel, this bit want too bad as it had been done before and undersealed so it was just a couple of inches up in to the inner arch\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>mmmm, check out my nice new lower short side \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> small skim of filler some satin black and it'll look fine and dandy!!\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/13.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>in the mean time, whilst i had and empty garage and the sun was shining i thought i'd better get on with the interior. This had all been taken out and dismantled to its component parts with all the screws carefully labelled and put into packets so when it came to re-assembly i'd hopefully know where it all went. The plan was to sand it all back and re-stain and varnish it whilst making any repairs as i went along. Remember this interior has a pretty hard life as it's used in all weathers and has me and Mrs. Empi climbing all over it in wetsuits, dripping salt water everywhere (don't get too excited Jayfor!!!) and chucking stuff about all over the shop. Anyhow, it was pretty easy to sand it back using a mouse sander for the large parts and some sanding blocks for the fiddly bits. Off to B&amp;Q for a couple of tins of dark mahogany stain and varnish all in one and then a pleasant afternoon in the garden getting sunburnt while i varnished it all up. Once it was dry i thought i'd mock it up in the garden just to see what it looked like and to make sure i could remember how it went back together. After all, it's not like the neighbours dont think we're weird enough without having a camper van interior set up in the back garden!!!!!\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/37.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/36.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Next installment will be tackling the long side and the inner sill eek!!!!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>shalom, Lee",
