If not I'd be more inclined to source a second hand 1303s box from a reputable seller on here or a known good box from on here. I got one for my bro in law from Onion on here who's generally got a few in stock, he said if I fitted it and it was dud he'd happily take it back and, knowing his reputation I have no reason to doubt that he would. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee.",
