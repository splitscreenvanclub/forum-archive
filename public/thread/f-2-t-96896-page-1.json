(my bus is shiney)\n<br> Is it for sale?\n<br> \n<br> You get the general direction.\n<br> Just add yours to the list.\n<br> \n<br> I'm thinking I might do a printed sheet that I can stick to the bus with the answers to all the questions.\n<br> I can then just point to it when someone asks a question.\n<br> Apologies to all the genuine people who sometimes come and talk to you.",
