    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br> \n<br> Very near the point of fitting a completely new long side panel with new inner sill, strengtheners repaired and rear arches repaired.\n<br> \n<br> Would appreciate peoples experiences with fitting the new long side panel with respect to securing the panel during fixing and the methods used to fix, welding and bonding?\n<br> \n<br> I have seen people ratchet strap battens on the exterior of the panel to ensure that the panel is seated against the strengtheners, is this a good idea?\n<br> \n<br> Advice appreciated\n<br> \n<br> Paul",
