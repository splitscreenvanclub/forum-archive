With the late beetle IRS rear drums, you get the wider brake shoes, and therefore better brakes.

There's not much downward adjustment on the front beam, most of it has been achieved with the drop spindles. \n<br> \n<br> Problem is there is only about 2 inches clearence between the wheel arch and the front tyres, so i have needed to go for some solid shocks (standard coil over shocks). these do the trick and keep tyre and wheel arch apart, but the ride is to solid and over any distance the family start to moan.\n<br> \n<br> As a bit of a short ass i have raised the height of the front bench seat by 3 inches, which has got me to thinking about cutting out the current wheel arch's and modifying them with the extra this ectra 3 inches then being able to use some more forgiving shocks. has any one else done this and has it worked is it as straight forward as in my mind? or should i just consider going for slimmer 55 tyres and give myself more clearence that way. ?\n<br> Chas",
