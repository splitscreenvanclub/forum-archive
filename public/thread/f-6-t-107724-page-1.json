There was a thread on here when they first started selling tow bars and it did cover using VS exhausts. I have the removable swan's neck which has a solid block on the back of the bar (which sits inside the curve of the bumper) going down. AFAIK this is the issue that the tuck away pipe runs along the lower edge back across the front of the exhaust box. I believe the swan' s neck will not fit but the fixed may do.\n<br>Ask...",
