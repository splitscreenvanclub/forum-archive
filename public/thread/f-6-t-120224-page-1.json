    "content" : "Hi, I know there have been many posts regarding brake bleeding but really struggling to find the cause of my particular problem.\n<br> I have a 1967 camper with totally new (every single part!) braking system including dual circuit master cylinder and VW Jim servo. The van is still running drums up front.\n<br> After months of messing around, bleeding and re-bleeding I have still not managing to get a solid brake pedal I have however managed to trace the problem to the front brakes. \n<br> Basically I have bled each component individually and get a solid pedal with just the m/c connected, the m/c and servo connected and the m/c, servo and rear brakes connected. As soon as I connect either or both front brakes, the pedal travels right to the floor. There are no leaks anywhere and I have bled with an easibleed and hydraulic bleeder and the manual method. \n<br> Totally at a loss now as all slave cylinders are new and seems coincidental that both front brakes cause the fault and not just one side. Could it be a compatibility (capacity) issue between the m/c and slave cylinders? Anyone have any suggestions?\n<br> Many thanks",

If the fault moves to the rear circuit then maybe the m/c has a fault in the internal machining that means it can't push enough fluid. \n<br> \n<br> ie you've tested and proved it does move some fluid and not leak air anywhere in the circuit. But maybe it's not moving enough fluid? It should, but something is not working.",

Drums haven't been skimmed as far as I know.\n<br> VW Jim, yes sounds like a good test as will eliminate any problems with the front brakes. It does seem as if it doesn't push enough fluid on the front circuit as pedal goes right to the floor as soon as either front brakes is connected.\n<br> Many thanks for the help really frustrated that I haven't been able to sort this!",
