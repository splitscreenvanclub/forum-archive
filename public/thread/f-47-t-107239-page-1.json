    "content" : "Have you taken the covers off the outside of one of the belts to see why they are stiff. Maybe they are full of crap. ..dust\n<br>..fluff or the grease has hardened. If you take one out and try to extend the belt all the way to the end and clip it with lots of pegs. ..you may be able to clean it up inside and get it freed up.\n<br>I do remember doing this with an old Audi belt they was full of rubbish. With care you may be able to rescue them. Try with one..what can you lose...?\n<br>Just do not fiddle with the braking mechanism.",
