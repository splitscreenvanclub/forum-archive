    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>Sorry, bit of a strange one, but basically I've got a couple of sets of wheels &amp; looking to try &amp; sort the required front tyre sizes out, so here goes..\n<br>\n<br>(1) Currently got a set of chrome empi's - the rear are sorted, but the front have got 165/50x15 tyres on, but they are too low-pro for me, so looking to swap just these front tyres for a pair of 165/65x15 - just wondered if anyone wanted to do a tyre swap &amp; possibly split the cost of having the tyres swapped over - mine are excellent condition, about 6mm of tread, nankang.\n<br>\n<br>(2) I also have a set of 5 inch BRM's in gloss black/polished - again the rear are sorted but the front currently have 185/65x15 tyres on - excellent condition Yokohama A drive with approx 6mm of tread - wondering if anyone wanted to swap my fronts for theirs - either just the tyres -again, I want 165/65x15, or possibly the whole wheel/tyre as long as your pair of wheels are perfect with no scratches, lacquer rash, etc (as mine are) - they would need to be 5 inch or 4.5 inch black/polished to match my rears.\n<br>\n<br>Alternatively, if anyone has any 165/65x15 tyres for sale, I could buy those &amp; then sell my 165/50x15's.\n<br>\n<br>Hope that all makes sense!\n<br>\n<br>I am in Solihull.\n<br>\n<br>thanks.",
