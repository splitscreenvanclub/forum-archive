It's taken a fair bit of time, but I have tried to do it as well as I could with Mark teaching me how an engine works and how to rebuild and engine and how to do it well etc etc etc.. The man had quite literally been a God send!\n<br>\n<br>So I don't know if you remeber this from a while back..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0089.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Mark and I stripped it down and had a pile of bits like this...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG00061-20110402-1527.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>and a crankcase and its friends looking like this....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG00062-20110402-1527.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We decided not to split the case as it was running brilliantly and thought that as there was tell tale signs of a previous rebuild we thought it may be a step in the wrong direction.\n<br>\n<br>So we got a nice sturdy engine stand and got to work. Bit of graft and paint comes up alrite...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0104.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0106.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We cleaned all the bits we were going to re-use in copious amounts of gunk and rust remover... we used phosphoric acid solution which removed the rust really well.....\n<br>\n<br>Mark cleaning something....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0181.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0179.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0193.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0195.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And nearly there....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Engine/IMG_0208.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We just have a few little bits to sort out before we can get it running again... then we can put it with the pile of bits 'ready to go' well until we run into any blips..... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br>\n<br>Until next time (which I will try to make sooner rather than later). Adios. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/biggrin.gif\" alt=\":-D\" title=\"Very Happy\">",
