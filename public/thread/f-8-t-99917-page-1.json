    "content" : "Agreed-value policies\n<br>\n<br>Agreed-value policies are not common. They usually relate to valuable or \"classic\" vehicles where the consumer has an investment to protect and the vehicle's value is unlikely to depreciate substantially – if at all. The insurer will have assessed the premium on the basis of the vehicle's agreed value and is obliged to pay that amount if the vehicle is \"written off\".\n<br>\n<br>Confusion can arise where a consumer believes they have an “agreed-value” policy because the proposal form asked them to state the vehicle’s value and/or because the policy schedule shows a value for the vehicle (usually based on the value in the proposal form). In these cases, the policy will usually just be an ordinary \"market value\" policy. We understand insurers ask about a vehicle’s value for other reasons (for example, to help detect fraud) – but it is not surprising that consumers sometimes think the information is relevant to the claim.\n<br>\n<br>Is my value guaranteed in the event of a claim?\n<br>Good question. In theory, yes, and this will be the case in the majority of cases. After all, to give it its technical definition, “agreed value is an insurance contract under which the insurer agrees to pay the insured a stated amount in the event of the total loss of the property insured without any adjustment for depreciation or appreciation”.\n<br>However, in the event of a total loss – or possible total loss – insurers will want to inspect the vehicle to ensure that its condition at the time of the accident remains in keeping with that at the time of its agreed valuation.\n<br>If the car has clearly deteriorated (other than its obvious damage!) then the insurer is likely to offer the current market value.",

It got shunted and the first thing I did was show the assessor the certificate and tell him that if he was going to write it off don't bother offering less than the 5 grand it was valued at as he'd be wasting his and my time. They paid the 5 grand. \n<br>On another note, I think you may have seriously undervalued your bus.
