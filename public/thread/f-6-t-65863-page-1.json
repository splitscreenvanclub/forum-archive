    "content" : "I've just POR 15 my bus so can't comment on the lasting properties as yet as it is about 4 weeks old at the moment. If you are able to remove old paint etc to get back to bare metal it goes on really nicely by brushing it on and creates a good looking finish. I did the front and rear of the bus including arches this way and am really happy with the results although I do have some runs in the paint but like you I'm after something to last and protect not win me a show and shine award. If you are bale to get the bus blasted underneath it would go on really well I would think without the need for the metal ready either as the surface would then already be free from rust and also rough enough for it to stick to.\n<br> \n<br> For the middle section (under floor) I just couldn't remove the paint so easily by hand because of the floor profile and all of the cross members (I have limited gargae facilities) etc so I cleaned and painted over what was there on the basis that it should still offer some protection and that part of the floor shouldn't get the stones and stuff flying up at it like the arches etc. Have to say it would be far better with paint off as I struggled to get it to cover well. In the end I used some of the silver POR15 which has the aluminium particles in it and that went on far better than the other colours and then used grey for the second coat to make it look more like factory primer look. Becasue I had to put on more paint for coverage I also ended up with more runs etc in the middle section. Overall it isn't too bad though and I think it will do the job I'm after. It isn't something I want to do in a hurry again I have to say but blasted underside would make it far more easy and if you were able to get it sprayed on by a paint shop even better I guess as I think the finish would look superb. Drop me a PM with an email address and I can send you some of my before, during in and after pics if you want.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Steve",

    "content" : "Choc,\n<br> \n<br> I used the POR15 marine clean and then metal ready at the rear (which you can see the effects of in one of the during pics). It is supposed to neutralise rust and etch the surface but for the front and because actually I'm very lucky to have one of those rust free buses I decided that the strip disc would create a rough enough surface for it to stick to and indeed it went on very well without any additional treatment. It doesn't like sticking to existing paint much which is why the middle section was harder for me but bare metal was great. I had to paint over the edges where I couldn't get the strip discs in to remove paint several times but in the end it made a good cover. It will be interesting to see over time if the rear holds up any better than the front becasue of the other applications used though.\n<br> \n<br> Purchased it all from frost restoration. You can buy packs of smaller cans (6 pack) which I'd recommend because when it hardens it is impossible to shift/open tins although I did find a layer of clingfilm between lid and can allowed a couple of days use before the paint in the tin then dried up on a larger tin.\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
