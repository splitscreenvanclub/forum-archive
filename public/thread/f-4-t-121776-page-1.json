    "content" : "<strong class=\"text-strong\">VW Porsche 914 1700 Type 4 engine case with 2-litre crank, barrels, pistons &amp; heads.</strong> \n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">SOLD</strong>\n<br> \n<br> Comprises:\n<br> Mahle 94mm high compression (flat top) pistons \n<br> Uprated cam and followers \n<br> High flow oil pump \n<br> Flywheel, clutch cover and plate\n<br> VW 2L oval port cylinder heads (VW casting no 022101372C)\n<br> \n<br> I obtained this engine 5 years ago to keep as a spare for my Split, which has a Type 4 engine installed. It had been a high performance unit with modified 914 heads, but these have been replaced by stock VW 2L bus heads. (Note: one combustion chamber shows some minor damage marks - not serious and will not require repair or affect operation). \n<br> The engine was dismantled purely for ease of transportation and, as I haven't needed it, it hasn't been rebuilt. All the parts have been carefully stored in a dry garage and with a full gasket set and a little effort, this will make an excellent power unit for a Split or Bay bus, Porsche 914, 'German look' Beetle or any other Type 4 based vehicle.\n<br> \n<br> Please note: this is a longblock (ie. short) motor only - no tinware (except cylinder under-tins), distributor, oil cooler, fuel pump, carbs, alternator or any other ancilliaries are included. I will include some extra Type 4 bits (manifolds, etc) at no additional cost. \n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">SOLD</strong>\n<br> \n<br> I can possibly assist with delivery, depending on location. Can deliver to the general area of Beaconsfield towards end of May if that helps. Otherwise collect from near Uttoxeter.\n<br> \n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=28712&amp;sid=bdb6c40a8aa1868efe8ca9aab046a1f1&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=28712&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bdb6c40a8aa1868efe8ca9aab046a1f1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_6665.jpg\" title=\"IMG_6665.jpg (314.52 KiB) Viewed 1599 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
