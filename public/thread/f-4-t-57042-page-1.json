They're all straight, with good paint, and have no kerbing whatsoever. The ET is 37, the diameter is 16\" and the width is 7\" I think they'd look pretty cool on a bay or T25/3, and are the \n<span style=\"color: #FF0040\">5x112 </span>PCD type, so straight on.\n<br>\n<br>£85 collected from Peterborough, or North London / Herts/ Beds/ Cambs delivery for £10\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>PM me or email \n<a href=\"mailto:Adrianrestoshop@fsmail.net\">Adrianrestoshop@fsmail.net</a>",
