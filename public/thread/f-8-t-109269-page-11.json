Is it possible to replace this inner sill without removing any of the actual front panel? I will replace the front lower sill below the lip. I've looked at various others project threads but all of them have removed at least the lower third of their front panel. I'd just rather leave OG metal if possible but if needs be ill cut out the lower part of the front panel. \n<br>Thanks. Loz",
