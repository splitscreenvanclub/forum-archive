That it keeps busses, especially commercials, as they originally were … which is cool. That in a world full of Chelase tractors it's non-conformist … so cool. That patina doesn't necessarily mean mechanically unsound. \n<br> \n<br> But if you cut me in half it would say \n<em class=\"text-italics\">Frustrated Engineer</em> and my gut says rust isn't cool. \n<br> \n<br> What are the practicalities of living with the rat look? Cost of buying? MOTs? A damp interior?",
