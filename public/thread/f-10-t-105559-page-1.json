Had a good chatter to John TC on the line-up and have made-up our mind that we will definitely come camping next year. We had an excellent day and managed to get all the info we wanted to help us with the little bits and bobs that need doing to our van to turn it from a day bus into a weekender \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
