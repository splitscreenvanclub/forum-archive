There was a RHD '54 Deluxe in the 80s that was rusting away in a field in that neck of the woods, but I don't have any more info on that one. There was a sketchy photo printed somewhere, maybe IVVM or more likely the Split Window Beetle News Letter of the Deluxe, but I can't for the life of me find it.",
