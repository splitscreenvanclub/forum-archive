    "content" : "Selling Roland, my 1970 early bay tin top, LHD lowered with adjusters on the front and 1 spline on rear, recon engine, gear box and new clutch, new brakes all round on new chrome wheels and tyres (low profile front), camper interior with smev sink and hob unit, loads of other work done with receipts for all bits.\n<br> Unfurtunately selling to pay for my roof to be done thanks to a TV advert dog that supposed to say ohh yes but said ohh NO after my roof battens rotted away causing tiles to drop, letting rain in and bring my bedroom ceiling down. So thanks Martin and your pet, I used to like you as a Doc and bad boy on TV now when I see you sticking your eggs in your cupoards I feel like shoving a jar up your AR$3.\n<br> Any way back to selling Roland, for more info ring me 07958 024988 or arrange viewing B75 6HZ.\n<br> Offers around Â£9950.\n<br> Mot till May 4th but could put 12 months on, tax exempt of course. But ready to drive away.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v202/petertheplumber/roland011.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
