    "content" : "Hi.\n<br> I'm running a weedeater beam on my '60, nice and low but the ride is so hard you find yourself bracing before every little road defect. I expected a harder ride due to the reduced spring length. but now i think it's mostly due to having the trailing arms pointing up at 30 degrees. I don't really want to go to the expence of buying dropped spindles if i can adapt what i have. So what i'm getting at is...................has anyone had any experience of swapping left to right. What's needed and how much will it drop. Any technical info would be appreciated as i have a workshop available.\n<br> Thanks.\n<br> Sinclair",

    "content" : "Its a bit hard to describe without a set in front of you, but here goes.\n<br> \n<br> You take the set apart, and the top king pin that used to sit on top of the upper spindle arm, now hangs from below the lower spindle arm, and the lower king pin that used to sit on top of the lower spindle arm with the spacer above it, now hangs from below the upper spindle arm with the spacer below it.\n<br> \n<br> Just read that again, and it doesn't sound too clear, but with a complete spindle set up in front of you, you'll understand it.\n<br> \n<br> Then you have to reverse the link pins. Problem arises as the 'new' upper king pin fouls on the spindle. This needs to be clearanced just enough to allow the link pin in position without touching.\n<br> \n<br> Most dropped spindles I've seen, leave off the dust / grease caps. But with a bit of machining, you can get those to fit as well....",
