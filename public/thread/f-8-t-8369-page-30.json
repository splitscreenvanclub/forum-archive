I did the ride on a c1950 bike made at my local bike shop less than a mile from our house. Harry was on a similar vintage Raleigh Lenton. The whole weekend was a blast. Great atmosphere at the festival, and on the ride all the locals were so friendly, and scenery was stunning.

It's not far off what was there before, to be honest. We lived with it for a year before designing the new one. The long side is south facing and gets all the sunlight. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/rdQLDg\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/16554232705_31c87d771c_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And this is why it initially got rejected by planning. Our garden is quite small for a pre-war semi, and even though the new build took up less room than what was there already, it was still too big for the garden, on paper at least. When we appealed the planning inspector didn't have a problem, once he'd seen neighbours outbuildings and garages.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/qWg6Y7\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16366599970_3d81c25c1e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And this is how it works in my head ... I still can't see how we can fit everything in comfortably, but anyway, our fault for having too much sh*t. Plan is to be able to winch the roof tent off the bus and into the eaves of the roof somehow. Oh, and to build doors big enough to drive in with it on as well. That is the biggest ball ache with the roof tent - having to take it off when you come back from a camping trip. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/rdFdL2\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/16552369441_144f14db72.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I'd like to be able to use all the roof space over the workshop area as storage for camping gear and all the other clutter I'm fed up with tripping over.\n<br>\n<br>Me and Susie need the new shed to work hard, not only as somewhere dry to keep the Kombi and BSA, but also a usable workshop space for her stained glass work, and for me to tinker with vintage racing bikes ...",
