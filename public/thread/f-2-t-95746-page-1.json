    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br> \n<br> My worse injury was when lowering the back end of my old 61, spring plates almost welded to the splines, removed splines and plates and spent 3 hours beating the spline with a copper mallet and bronze drift. getting towards lunch so did not deburr the drift, hit hand with copper mallet cut forefinger, so I thought. could not stop the bleeding so wife used some of her wonder nursey stuff and I carried on after lunch. Next morning large track mark from small cut to inside of finger, heat and swelling. A&amp;E and xray, outcome bronze shard 4mm x 2mm buried in my finger near the bone. Had infection starting so was admitted overnight, had to sit like a right plonker in a ward with the genuine sick with IV antibiotics with my finger in the air like I was calling the nurse!! Next morning the doctor visits me and informs me its close to the nerves and he wants to do an op under general and that I might lose some feeling if it goes wrong. I exclaimed that was my best podging finger and that he is having a laugh!! Finally after another day I force the local op route and I am out in 2 days!!!\n<br> \n<br> Last year I broke my wife's toe when being recovered in the old 57. Van low. Fuel pump up the shoot so fuel up and down. wheels spun and plank used to get us on the loader shot out hitting the wife on the big toe as she was watching the exhaust, sadly she had sandals on! 6 weeks off work!! She never said a word for the 3 hour journey home, when we got out at home she limped up the drive and I remarked \"what's the matter with you\" Took me 2 days to get her sandal out of my ear!! \n<br> \n<br> Made me laugh\n<br> \n<br> Gaz",

I naturally go to sit up and hit my chest to put the fire out, but smack my head on the floor of the bus, then slide out quick and sit up to put the flames out before i had a chance flames singed the stubble on my face,!!! Then finally beat the flames out, checked my clothes to see the damage ....................big hole clean through my dickies overalls, then burnt big hole through my old blue jumper and had just started to singe/blacken my t shirt underneath!\n<br> \n<br> I still laugh today about that, it was like something from frank spencer!!",
