Now just got to find the right car. Something that is basically ok but he is prepared to do some work himself (so I will probably be on here asking for support for him!! at some point \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> ).",

My husband, Steve bought my daughter a beetle many years ago and that needed far more doing that he had hoped, unfortunately she ended up having to do most of the work on her own and with friends. More recently she ended up getting the bodywork done and concentrated on rebuilding the engine herself. So Matthew is quite aware of how much work he could be taking on, I am however concerned that he has college etc to deal with as well.",
