    "content" : "Can anyone recommend a good reliable engine builder to me please, whether it's a company or just someone that's been building them for years and got a great reputation?\n<br>\n<br>I have recently pulled an engine from one bus to fit to another bus and found that the rear main oil seal is leaking. I thought I would change the seal whilst it was out but after doing some reading it would appear changing the seal might not fix the leak. I checked the engine for end float and it has some but I have not got the tools or the time to do this job properly so would like to take it to someone to get it checked and repaired properly.\n<br>\n<br>I live just outside Nottingham so local to me would be good but travelling is not an issue (within reason) either.",
