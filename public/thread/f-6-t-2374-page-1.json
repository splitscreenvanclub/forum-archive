It's not possible to get these in a low profile as far as I know. Some insurance companies can be funny about it, as you know they will try anything not to pay up.\n<br> \n<br> It's just a thought that's all but may be worth doing.\n<br> \n<br> OP",

    "content" : "Tyre selection can be hard work! If it helps any I can tell you that the rubber on the Devon Caravett at the end of the links is a 145/65/15 front and 195/65/15 rear combo.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+75703.jpg\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/inde ... +75703.jpg</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+75701.jpg\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/inde ... +75701.jpg</a>\n<br> \n<br> The rear was straight axeled by the good people at... guess where - and so the rear tyre choise was also a factor in getting the right final drive ratio and engine combo.\n<br> \n<br> The rear rims are 5.5\" x 15\". I would encounter problems running any 'fatter' or 'taller' tyres because the clearance with the out-side of the wheel arch is tight as it is and it would be even tighter on earlier vans without the arch bulge. \n<br> \n<br> Bear in mind that changing the wheel can be more difficult unless you jack the van quite high - which i wouldn't really want to do with my bilstien jack on a rainy hard shoulder (I carry around a trolly jack just in case).\n<br> \n<br> I might want a fatter tyre than the 145 at the front. I have been, supprised though that handling wise they work better than you might think. I was expecting them to be quite skitty and scrub out on corners, but i haven't felt either of these things.\n<br> \n<br> I've not had the fronts skid (touch wood) and I have the CSP disc brakes which i have tested under pretty hard braking. They will start to 'bite' if you turn too hard into a corner. But then, the great thing about driving a splitty is you always feel the speed you're doing... so try not to push your van too hard into anything!\n<br> \n<br> The ride is very comfortable, especially considdering that it is pretty low. I think this is also to do with the fitted ball joints.\n<br> \n<br> The steering box can scrape on those high table top traffic calmers.\n<br> \n<br> My tyre / ride height quest shall continue - I'm looking at vintage polyglass tyres (like on the herbie bug) and the sizing system is something else!\n<br> \n<br> Hope this info helps,\n<br> \n<br> Cheers,\n<br> jc",
