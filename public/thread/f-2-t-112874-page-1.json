    "content" : "Well it was our first Brighton breeze and it was the best and worst weekend. After leaving hook road early Saturday we were just getting to the roundabout to join the m25 when all brakes failed and ended up rear ending my mate Graham in his bus, luckily everybody was relatively ok. Buses came off a little worse but are fixable. I feel so bad for poor old Graham as he hasn't had the bus long.\n<br>Any way we got recovered to Madeira drive where we went on a search for a flexy brake pipe but no joy so had to go to heritage up the road to fetch one. Bobby from milk and 2 came over and fitted the new brake pipe and we was working again (top man Is Bob and always on hand whenever I have needs him). We drove up to the campsite and parked up, Bren and Graham from midland bay jumped on Graham's bus and sorted all the metal work out in the back of Graham's bus so he could at least drive it home ( awesome effort from those guys) \n<br>We then had one of the best nights at a show yet full of absolute belly laughs.\n<br>We all managed to get home safe and sound.\n<br>So massive thanks to everyone that helped out it puts your faith back in humanity lol",
