The 'dent' in the gutter is missing to let the water out and the gutter appears to change profile. The A pillar on the passenger side looks to be proud of the roof line and very wavy too.... \n<br>\n<br>Unless you're a proficient welder I'd stay well away. There's normally a very good reason (or 2 or 3) that someone imports a van like this then sells it right away. 16k is way too much for this bus, should be more like 6k\"\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Yeh I think Ben's right that a later front clip was crudely welded on hence the a-post and roof dramas. Also incorrect doors both sides when I saw photos a year or two ago. Think the rear had been modded to look like a later bus too but this has obviously been corrected. Sold for 5 or 6k but didn't have a ticket back then \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",
