These pics show the metal roof starting to appear as the fibreglass one is lifted away. I've no idea at the moment if the fibreglass is hiding a load more work, but there's only one way to find out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1243.photobucket.com/user/edwardtoogood/media/IMG_0554.JPG_zpsocabpq5s.jpeg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg549/edwardtoogood/IMG_0554.JPG_zpsocabpq5s.jpeg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1243.photobucket.com/user/edwardtoogood/media/IMG_0555.JPG_zps8fw5px0f.jpeg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg549/edwardtoogood/IMG_0555.JPG_zps8fw5px0f.jpeg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

I now have a convertible...\n<br>\n<br>The front and rear gutters were rusted out so removing the hightop was the only way to gain access to repair them. Jon is hard at work repairing the guttering and then the hightop will be put back on. I considered putting a pop top in instead, but as I don't have much of an existing roof that would be a major undertaking. And although the fibreglass roof isn't everyone's cup of tea I love having the hightop and it is unique.\n<br>\n<br>Underneath the fibreglass the roof and majority of the gutters weren't too bad.

VW Welding have been a delight to deal with and now I just can't wait to see John start to get some colour back on the van. \n<br>\n<br>I'm planning to put a buddy seat in behind the drivers seat. I've had an extra seat belt mount installed the facilitate that. The purpose of this will be to put my daughters (18 months old) car seat on when we're travelling. I prefer the idea of her being there behind the bulkhead as opposed to up front. Does anyone have any experience and/or recommendations of child seats in vans? Also any tips or recommendations on which buddy seat to go for would be good.",

Should the unthinkable happen the last thing you want is for the seat to collapse with the child seat strapped to it. We've just bought the next size up for little Empi and according to the blurb we shouldn't have to buy another one ever as various parts of it come off as he grows until it ends up as just a booster seat.
