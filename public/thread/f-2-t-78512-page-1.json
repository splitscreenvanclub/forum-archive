I ignored it for a while then I moved so had to change v5, so i photocopied birth cert and put it in with the amended V5, It took a little longer to come back than my other vehicles so I rang and to my surprise they said it was all ok and was being sent back. When I got it still said registered in '56 but at the bottom had 'was manufactured in 1958' so my bus was registered two years before it was made! I'm not one to argue so I've left it at that. I hope you get yours sorted\n<br> \n<br> James",
