    "content" : "Hi Guys, \n<br>So I've had another urge for a project and this time it's converting my 67 Crewcab into a mobile coffee van. \n<br>\n<br>I've done quite a bit of research into it and know all the equipment/ costs involved, the only thing I've struggled with is finding places to trade. \n<br>\n<br>To start with quite a few places are managed and organise their own catering and secondly at other events the trading prices are so high!\n<br>\n<br>Has anyone got any experience of trading at events? Or any show managers that are looking for traders? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance!",
