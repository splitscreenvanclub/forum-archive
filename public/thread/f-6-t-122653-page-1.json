I know there is no problem with the bulbs or flasher relay as if I switch the wires from the indicator stalk to connect to the right hand side lights they flash and work correctly, I also know the stalk is not the problem as have tried two separate stalks and the same problem exists. So bulbs work, flasher relay works and stalk works. What am I missing? Any help out there please",
