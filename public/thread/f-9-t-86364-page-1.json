There's no obligation to buy anything but you have to be self contained - not insofar as a personality trait - more that you can exist in your bus without recourse to using external facilities. Having said that, the guide lists many interesting things but the two most critical ones are English speaking hosts and toilets.\n<br>\n<br>Definitely worth a look at - we're staying at a snail farm near Roscoff in August.",
