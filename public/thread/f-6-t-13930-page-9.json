    "content" : "<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>rob.e wrote:</cite>Ok, so I've read the thread from start to finish, very interesting reading.\n  <br>\n  <br>I'm looking to buy a van soon (most likely a late split) and i'm planning out what to do. I don't want something that's in the weeds - it needs to sit nicely lower than stock but still be practical as a family camping bus, handle ride and stop well (ideally discs on the front, maybe with a servo too?).\n  <br>\n  <br>I've priced up the \"traditional\" approach ie dropped spindles, narrowed adjustable beam on the front, shorter shocks and a spline change at the rear, but having read this thread it looks to make more sense to go with the Red9 wishbone upgrade, given it's not that much more expensive, has great reviews from owners and also has the benefit of rack and pinion.\n  <br>\n  <br>So here's the question in a nutshell; starting with a stock late split van and a buget of say, Â£3k where would your money go?\n  <br>\n  <br>Red9 wishbones with late bay discs on the front + servo, one spline at the rear, or should i just save some money and go with just dropped spindles (+discs) given its only having a mild drop?\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Hi\n<br>I would spend the money on the red9 wishbone kit and a set of creative adjustable spring plates,get it over with first time. Then you have infinitely adjustable suspension.\n<br>I've got their coilovers system on a bay beam with discs,dual master cylinder and servo.its a good set up but the steering is the big issue for me\n<br>My next step is the wishbone kit,I only wish I had done it to start with ,save me buying all my other stuff.\n<br>Good luck...",

    "content" : "Hi all, very interesting. If I wanted to drop the bus very slightly (1\" or so) would adjusters be ok on the front and 1 lowered 1 spline on the back. \n<br>\n<br>Also, I intend to fit 15\" standard wheels. Does anyone the correct tyre size for these?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Jim",
