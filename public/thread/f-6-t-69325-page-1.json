The engine is run in and has great compression.\n<br> \n<br> Only happens at high rev's ( I know, dont rev it!!)",

It also threw me on my dipstick level as I am unsure if it now affectively is longer due to the fact it goes further down into the sump?\n<br> \n<br> Any one got any measurements? I have a adjustable VDO one for temp too.",
