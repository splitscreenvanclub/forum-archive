When I first fitted my larger engine I filled to max on dipstickmand had a rubbish breather. Result oil everywhere . Now running sand seal,csp breather box and oil filled to minimum on dipstick. No leaks at present.\n<br> Cheers Lee.",

    "content" : "Ah yeah, forgot about oil levels. Good thing about threads like this is that they kind of refresh your knowledge as more people input to them. I don't run a deep sump but found that if I filled to max level it tended to blow out until it was about 3/4 mark on the dipstick then stop. Guess it was finding its own level of sorts. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee",
