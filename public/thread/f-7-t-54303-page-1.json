    "content" : "I'm in discussion at the moment with Tracker, \n<a href=\"http://www.tracker.co.uk/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.tracker.co.uk/</a> about getting club members a discount.\n<br>\n<br>Exact details are yet to be arranged. It could be simply a discounted purchase price, or an upgrade to the level of service offered etc. Not sure yet, but naturally it will be easier to get good discounts if I have a better idea on how many systems you guys \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">potentially </span>might be interested in. (Much the same as when we were in original discussions with Firetec)\n<br>\n<br>Anyways, let me know your thoughts. At this stage its only expressing an interest. If this goes ahead, I'll come up with a way of keeping track of those that are having a system without using any names, as its a security feature, best not too let any scumbags know what you have.",

The vehicle is now emitting a silent land based radio signal.\n<br>\n<br>Stage 3:\n<br>The silent signal can now be picked up by any of the UK's 52 police forces that are within the vicinity of the stolen vehicle. The signal will direct the police to the exact location of the stolen vehicle.\n<br>\n<br>Stage 4:\n<br>On customer request, a uniformed guard waits with your vehicle until it is recovered to a destination of your choice - anywhere in mainland Britain. This service applies only to stolen vehicles located within mainland Great Britain.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">TRACKER Monitor </span>\n<br>\n<br>Stage 1:\n<br>If a TRACKER Monitor equipped vehicle is illegally moved, a movement sensor hidden in the vehicle sends a signal to TRACKER HQ.\n<br>\n<br>Stage 2:\n<br>TRACKER HQ contacts the vehicle owner to confirm whether the vehicle has been stolen.

When confirmed as stolen to TRACKER HQ and the police, the TRACKER unit hidden in the stolen vehicle is activated. The vehicle is now emitting a silent land based radio signal and its position is being logged via GPS satellites.\n<br>\n<br>Stage 3:\n<br>The silent signal can now be picked up by any of the UK's 52 police forces that are within the vicinity of the stolen vehicle. The signal and the GPS satellite positional information will work in conjunction to direct the police to the exact location of the stolen vehicle.\n<br>\n<br>Stage 4:\n<br>On customer request, a uniformed guard waits with your vehicle until it is recovered to a destination of your choice - anywhere in mainland Britain. This service applies only to stolen vehicles located within mainland Great Britain. \n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><br>TRACKER Retrieve </span>\n<br> \n<br>How does TRACKER Response work?\n<br>TRACKER Response is equipped to monitor the illegal movement of your vehicle, even when the ignition is turned off and the immobilizer is activated.\n<br>\n<br>If the vehicle is moved without your authorization an alert is generated and you will be notified accordingly. You then contact TRACKER HQ to provide confirmation of the theft. Using GPS and our patented VHF technology, the TRACKER control room can display the vehicle's precise location on computer-based maps.\n<br>\n<br>Driver Validation Tag\n<br>TRACKER Response includes a driver validation system that can detect whether the person driving the vehicle is authorised to do so. If the tag cannot be detected by the TRACKER Response unit, for example in the event of a theft where the thief does not have the tag, an alert will be generated and on confirmation of the theft, the tracking process begins\n<br>\n<br>TRACKER Response Customer Website\n<br>For the first time TRACKER's Stolen Vehicle Recovery system is offering a truly interactive customer website to TRACKER Response customers. This will provide you with a host of additional benefits, including:\n<br>\n<br>Route planner functionality:\n<br>This will provide you with the best-selected route for your chosen journey. In addition, TRACKER Response can highlight roadwork locations and other vehicle incidents.\n<br>\n<br>Historical travel information:\n<br>This will allow you to see which routes your vehicle has travelled over a 6-month period, for example if you have lent your vehicle to another driver. Should you use your personal vehicle for business use, TRACKER Response allows you to flag business journeys and provides an interactive calculator, which will detail each business journey selected.\n<br>\n<br>Personal reminder alerts:\n<br>In the instance where you leave the vehicle unattended, for example, at a train station car park, you can set a personal alert that will notify you of any vehicle movement. The TRACKER Response customer website allows you to highlight important dates, such as; your car's MOT or friend's birthday.\n<br>\n<br>On the specified date, an alert will be sent to you reminding you of the event. A number of other alerts are also available such as a speed monitor.\n<br>\n<br>European Cover\n<br>TRACKER Monitor and TRACKER Horizon provide tracking throughout the UK, France and Spain as standard. In addition to the UK, France and Spain, TRACKER Response and TRACKER Echo are operational throughout Western Europe.",

If i want to work on the car and do things like jack it up, you have to phone them to get it switched off - it automatically gets put back on at an agreed time. Thats once you have waited through the automated message! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>2. If you store the car over the winter you have to keep the battery charged as if it goes flat the little battery in the Tracker system then gets used. I think you can only let that go flat a couple of times before Traker charge you for the replacement unit.\n<br>3. You have to negotiate with the installer about where and how to install it. They are told that they are not allowed to tell you but when they see the car and realise how simple it is they soon work out you will find it any way - use this excuse to get it installed where YOU want.\n<br>\n<br>Other wise a fine idea to keep the theaving barstewards away!",

Yet to determine if Tracker has the motion sensors to pick up if its being towed or trailered. Once the spec's are worked out, ie which is better hardware, it'll make the price choice easier. We'll get there. Maybe RAC would give a counter offer too....",
