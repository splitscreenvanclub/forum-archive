Many Many thanks for all your kind words and comments. It really has been a very \n<br> humbling couple of days and I feel very honoured that so many of you voted for my Bus.\n<br> \n<br> The quality of all the buses on show was truly awesome and they all represent months and months of hard\n<br> work and dedication by all who worked on them.\n<br> \n<br> It was a brilliant weekend and I look forward to seeing you all later in the year. \n<br> \n<br> JJ",
