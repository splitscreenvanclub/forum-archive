    "content" : "I have just had a very sad email from a lady who paid Â£10k deposit to All Classics of Leicester who promised to get a bus done up in SA and shipped over. Of course it never happened and despite a high court judgement the bailiffs were unable to locate him (the business premises were vacant and no sign of life). The guy is Mr Mungari and his partner in crime in SA is Vigil Bare.\n<br> Pass the word don't deal with them!\n<br> and if anyone has any leads on tracking him down or had similar bad experiences I am sure the lady would like to know...I wonder if the other SA company with a thread about dreadful workmanship on this forum is the same people?",

When I was looking into buying a campervan I had done some reach but had decided on All Classics UK Ltd as after meeting with Terrence Munangi and doing all back round checks there was know alarm bells. So sadly to my great regret I went ahead. But thanks to people like yourself helping spread the word and my story being shared on Facebook and you tube that no one else will fall to the same fate as I have.\n<br> Thank you Kerry Adams",
