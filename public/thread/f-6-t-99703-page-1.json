    "content" : "Hi\n<br> \n<br> There are 2 types of flywheel seal and 2 types of crank. O ring seal and the earlier paper or metal seal. Both are interchangeable to some degree. A 1500 should be 200mm but the 180 should fit with the paper seal. You need to make sure your starter is the correct one for the flywheel, your clutch is the correct one for the release bearing and you need to check your endfloat when you swap flywheel. \n<br> \n<br> Whereabouts are you based?\n<br> \n<br> Seb",

You can run a 6v starter on 12v.\n<br> \n<br> I am guessing the box is 6v along with the starter and flywheel but you need to check. If so bolt it up with a paper gasket, check endfloat or nip it to a garage who can, check your rear flywheel seal (now the time to replace it if needed (and your local vw main dealer can order genuine ones in) torque up and your good to go.\n<br> \n<br> Simples!",
