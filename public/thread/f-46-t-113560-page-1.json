    "content" : "This will be a non reply....\n<br>I have only ever seen one Deluxe original bus (in Turkis as well) an ex Bus of the the year from the anals of SSVC history.... I was not allowed to take pictures.. it was completely untouched still with the Rosettes as it was driven into the garage from winning.....\n<br>This bus I tried to buy but did not succeed, belonging to a very unique Gentleman let's call him Keith....A very clever designer and patent holder....\n<br>He did sell me the Dormobile Front three bar rack and the home made rear...\n<br>The seat covers in the front were \"tuck and roll\" stitched not plain or heat seal seamed...so not like TWI covers at all....\n<br>Of course I have no idea if these were original covers or had been made for this bus!\n<br>\n<br>I used TMI covers for Peebles and I am very pleased with them\n<br>I though maybe look on thesamba.com at the trim pages for deluxe upholstery pictures...I have just checked from the period where 1/3 2/3 were introduced all the pictures do show heat seamed covers... so I think these were non standard covers made for that award winning bus..\n<br>\n<br>You need someone to send detailed pictures of their OG Deluxe 1/3 2/3 seat cover (with dims for the spacings if they are stitched)\n<br>My 62 Devonette had the OG stitched basalt grey cover on a hump back bench seat. I sent the old cover to Bromsgrove and Peter copied it exactly to make me some covers..It is finished waiting the body..\n<br>\n<br>I had an easicool handle... Bobley gave me an easicool which was being retored...in bits..with the door converted to LHD..\n<br>I passed it forwards to Rippers....on a use or pass forwards basis for his LH OG Devon interior..\n<br>It was given to me (beer tokens involved - Bobley is such a gent...)",
