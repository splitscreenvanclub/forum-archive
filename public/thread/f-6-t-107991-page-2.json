This is a flat strip frame which sits on the top and bottom of the spring pack. The springs keep these two \"planes\" spaced apart. The springs are held to the upper and lower frames by sheet strip soft over clips. The upper and lower frames and flips were just soft iron strip\n<br> To access the broken springs you in clamp the ends snd wind them out.\n<br>You will see they are also connected in multi spring groups. \n<br>You just wind out the broken pics. .perhaps f tom either side..\n<br>Post pics when you are done..\n<br>So rewarding when you have finished. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>G",
