Van started well and ran stronger, until it died again after about half an hour, this time not on tickover and with some backfiring, wouldn't start for a long time basically until it was compleatly cold, could smell fuel getting through to it when it wouldn't start, tried two coils while it was stranded, wouldn't start.Ran great after it restarted and would stop and restart normally.
