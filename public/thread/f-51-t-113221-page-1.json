    "content" : "I have made a decision to let this go as I have realised I have too many projects to complete . This one really is a great easy project for over the winter for some one with basic skills having had all the hard work done and NOT needing ££££££ on welding and sourcing parts, that all projects usually require! Once completed you will have a nice early small back window subhatch camper with the ultra rare flip seat up front. The ex California bus has had all new metal where needed and a fresh coat of 2K paint to a reasonable standard but not Concourse .It has been slightly lowered and sits on alloy wheels although I can throw in a set of stock wheels if you prefer .It also comes with a pair of og bumpers that will require some work before painting or for an extra £500 I have a nice set of US spec bumpers I bought for this bus your choice. The Engine which came with the bus will need going through as it is untested. Sorry but the Camper kit is long gone only the flip seat is there but that is reflected in the price.No tent but comes with a set of repop poles . Has had new brakes all round just need bleeding as well as new rubber for the windows etc .Bus has both vin &amp; m code tags present and all duties and taxes are paid.
