    "content" : "If you have an aftermarket shroud you may not have all the correct fins inside it either, depending on which one you’ve bought. \n<br> \n<br> Best option is to try and buy an original one with the flaps. \n<br> \n<br> Second best option if you think you’ve got all the correct fins inside yours is to transpose a set of original flaps and linkage bar into your fan housing. I did this for a 36hp shroud because they never came with flaps. \n<br> \n<br> There’s a bit of complexity here because if you had an early 36hp shroud that never had flaps then it would cool effectively without them and the flaps just help it heat up to temperature quicker and therefore prolong the life of your engine. However you have a later shroud that was designed to have flaps so the flaps are needed to correctly divert the airflow evenly over all the cylinders. So even if you didn’t have a thermostat and just left your flaps open the whole time, you would still need the flaps!\n<br> \n<br> Hope that helps\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

    "content" : "If you want a shroud with heat exchanger outlets then there’s no reason to get a 36hp style because all types of oil cooling and both single and twin port engines were made with heat exchanger outlets so you can get an original shroud instead. \n<br> \n<br> Even though they say it has the correct fins inside they rarely do - only CB aftermarket shrouds are made close enough to work well. More importantly no 36hp shroud ever had heater outlets so the airflow doesn’t work properly in them - if you look they are just square cut into the front face whereas original shrouds the heater outlets sweep out and the fins inside are designed to use them as part of the overall cooling effectiveness. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> This website has everything you need to know about fan shrouds and cooling:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.vw-resource.com/cooling_system.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.vw-resource.com/cooling_system.html</a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.vw-resource.com/vanes_thermostat.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.vw-resource.com/vanes_thermostat.html</a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

    "content" : "Pretty sure the flaps will transpose across but you’ll need a different linkage bar as it needs to go round the doghouse. There’s a bar for each set of flaps and a third one to link them, as opposed to the single bar you have for a single port shroud. \n<br> \n<br> You’ll need to pick up the mount which transposes the oil cooler too and a ‘Hoover bit’ (named after Bob Hoover, nothing to do with suction) which makes sure the airflow goes through the oil cooler and not around the edge. \n<br> \n<br> I presume the doghouse cooler you’ve found comes with the two bits at the back too. And you’ll also need a set of twinport tinwear which has space for the manifold and also has a hole in the rear piece for the exit shute. Not sure if you can get away with just the head tins and rear piece or if you’ll need everything. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
