Any good fitting tips welcome! That inner 'c' shaped seal looks like it could be a pig to put in?\n<br> \n<br> So far I have seen custom + commercial quarter lights (frame+glass+catch+fitting kit) @ £89 each. Seals are about £23 for TWO per side. Anything else I need to buy for them?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance.",

I'm not too sure about which part you describe as \"metal bit that pokes up and sits inside the frame\", the catch???\n<br> \n<br> I bought a seal (strip of thin rubber) from Alan Schofields. Many others have used a sealant like Sikaflex to fit the glass into the frame.\n<br> \n<br> Fitting the seal would be difficult with the frame still attached to the door.\n<br> \n<br> rubber strip stretched around the glass and offered up to the frame:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/dsbus/door%20frame/DSCF0056.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/dsbus/door%20frame/DSCF0057.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then pushed into place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/dsbus/door%20frame/DSCF0058.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Trim the excess:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/dsbus/door%20frame/DSCF0059.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> installed back into the frame:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/dsbus/door%20frame/DSCF0061.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
