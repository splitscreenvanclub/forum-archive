    "content" : "Hi Gertjan,\n<br> \n<br> Normally you get glazed brakes from lightly riding the pedal, or over-adjusted brakes so they are dragging all the time - this heats up the shoes/dums and makes them very smooth &amp; shiny - can also cause squeal/poor stopping power.\n<br> \n<br> Ideally remove the drums and attack the drum braking surface with some emery paper to scuff them up, and also do the same on the brake shoe friction material - it will look glassy/shiny and hard - this is what you need to get off.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers, TED",
