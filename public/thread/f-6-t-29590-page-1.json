    "content" : "From factory it was only the 67 year model that had a reversing light. If your bus is late enough to have a reversing light blank, then it's a relatively simple job. I don't know when this was, but best guess would be with the 1500 engine.\n<br> \n<br> The original way of wiring them is to take a fused feed off the coil, into the switch which just winds into the blank on the side of the box.\n<br> \n<br> I've spent a while trawling the web for pictures that show the location of the switch, but every photo I can find is taken from the wrong angle \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-(\" title=\"Sad\"> There are a few pics that 'might' help here\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/techbulletins/e3.php\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/man ... ins/e3.php</a>\n<br> \n<br> along with details of a VW designed method that used a bracket that bolted onto the back of the shift rod and operated a switch screwed onto the vehicle \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> The other option is to find one of the reversing light switches that goes on the back of the speedo and only makes a contact when the cable runs backwards. Have a look at this thread\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.ukshells.co.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=26958&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.ssvc.ukshells.co.uk/phpbb/vi ... highlight=</a>\n<br> \n<br> as the original poster has one and mentions he may be gettting rid of it. They're one of the easist ways to install, but the one downside is they only come on once you start moving backwards, and go off again when you stop, not when you select reverse.\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps.",
