    "content" : "Hi\n<br> This is the first time Ive noticed it - I had just driven back from Billing, switched the engine off and went to have the obligatory look in the engine bay, to my horror fuel was leaking quite heavily out of the carb spindle!! \n<br> \n<br> This is something I can definitely do without as I head off in the van on holiday around europe in a couple of weeks. \n<br> \n<br> I have read other similar posts that say that I need the spindle re-bushed. The only person that seems to do this is a chap called Laurie Ellis who I have called but unfortunately he can't do it before i go on holiday. Is there anybody else who can do this? Also should that much fuel be getting to the spindle once the engine is switched off? \n<br> Your help would be most appreciated!!!!!\n<br> Thanks\n<br> Ady",

I have emailed Richard Carey but he hasn't got back to me yet.\n<br> \n<br> Snowman - is it possible to adjust the float level on a 30 PICT 1? When I parked I was on a slight hill.\n<br> \n<br> Just a thought but my bus has only done 65,000 original miles so I would have thought that the carb spindles would not be worn out. What is forcing all the fuel down to the spindles?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks again\n<br> \n<br> Ady",
