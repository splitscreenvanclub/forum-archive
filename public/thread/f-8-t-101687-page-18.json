    "content" : "I had to ditch my carb and buy a reconditioned one because it had incurable air inleakage problems so I just couldn't tune it and the engine ran like a dog. The throttle spindle bushes were so badly worn that even new bushes wouldn't fix it. Also, someone had tightened the carb down so hard they'd bent both the carb flange and the and inlet manifold flange that it sits on. I had to file the manifold flange flat before mounting the new carb to get it to seal.\n<br>\n<br>The best trick I found to diagnose the problem was to get our 'dustbuster' hand-held vacuum that has a blow function and attach its flexi-hose to the inlet at the top of the carb with Duck Tape. I set the dustbuster to blow so it pressurised the carb and manifold, then I sprayed a mixture of fairy liquid and water anywhere that air might get sucked in when the engine is running (around the throttle spindle, the carb-to-manifold and manifold-to-head connections and the manifold rubber joints (dual port manifold)).\n<br>\n<br>The air leaks caused big bubbles in the soapy water, so I could see the leaks.\n<br>\n<br>If you can get hold of a vacuum cleaner with a blow setting, give it a try. If you don't have leaks, you can at least rule that out (although you might still have blocked jets in the carb). The good thing is that the engine doesn't need to run to be able to do that test.\n<br>\n<br>The usual trick is to aerosol spray carb cleaner or WD40 around the likely leakage spots which causes the engine to run rough wherever it sucks the aerosol in, but my engine ran so badly that test was inconclusive.",
