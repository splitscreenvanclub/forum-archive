Gul started in 1967 in the back of a splitty on fistral beach cornwall. the van is a 1960 double door walk through going back to the original sealing wax red. In brief I am the brand manager for Gul and have personally been attending vw shows for 14 years, setting up Gnarlyvw with burns59 in 1999 (now reborn in 2010!) this is not just another company doing a van to jump on the bandwagon, we have many enthusiasts here and this is a project based on passion. Gul as a company have owned every van model from splitscreen to T5 even an LT35! The employees also make up a good selection of personal air/watercooled VW's. We will be attending VW shows this year with our vans and trading products also..oh yes and we are members of the splitscreen van club.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i55.tinypic.com/nqx01v.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Regards\n<br>Jake (smiler23)",
