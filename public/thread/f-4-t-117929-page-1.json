    "content" : "This front seat set came out of my US 67 import and they are in excellent condition. The covers are a dark green fabric which may be a replacement material, as it had some restoration work done in the US back in the 80's, so I'm guessing they were put one then. But they have a real period feel to them.\n<br>The only reason I'm selling them is that the bulkhead had been hacked about and I came across a walkthrough cut, so it was an opportunity to go down that route.\n<br>\n<br>These are ready to drop straight in, I'm not sure quite what these are worth, but I'm open to decent offers, but let's start at £750 for the set.\n<br>Cheers Kevin Mobile: 07752 107235\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n <!-- ia1 -->IMG_6993.JPG\n <!-- ia1 -->\n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n <!-- ia0 -->IMG_6994.JPG\n <!-- ia0 -->\n</div>",
