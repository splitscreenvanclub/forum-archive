I can see motor homes (wouldn't class my split as motor home) have to park in the coach parks and these have to be cleared overnight, but normal car parks allow overnight parking but not sure if there is a rule banning sleeping in them.\n<br>\n<br>Any local knowledge or experience?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers David",

I think as long as you keep it subtle no one has an issue. I just avoid car parks that state no overnight as heard a few people got caught and fines. Good luck.",
