This means that you have 7 days to inspect the camper for any damages and decide if you want to keep it or not!Because I will sign eBay's return policy, your money will be insured by them and you will have the option to reject the deal, only if we go through PayPal as well. If this is the case, you will receive a full refund (money back) from PayPal and I will have to take the camper back on my cost! You can read more about it following the link below:\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://safety-center-page-eb-ay.co.uk-help-buy-contextual-return-policy.ds.fulegeros.info/help-return-policy/Help.php\">http://safety-center-page-eb-ay.co.uk-h ... y/Help.php</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>Let me know if the above return policy is acceptable and if you want to purchase the camper please confirm your PayPal email for further instructions.\n<br>Thanks",
