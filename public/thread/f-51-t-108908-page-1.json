    "content" : "Right hand drive 1954 Barndoor Samba project for sale, Chassis number 20-104350.\n<br>\n<br>Hi All, You may have seen that I have put my 1950 bus up for sale, I also have a few other busses that I am considering selling, that I will keep if the 50 sells. This is one of them.\n<br>\n<br>In 2008 I was able to purchase this RHD Samba project from Sweden. To date I believe this is still the last one sold on the public market. I think there are 22 RHD barndoor samba’s remaining globally, of which very few are projects, and this is the only one available to buy. Since I bought it I started chasing earlier and earlier busses, so I have not got around to starting any work on it, apart from sourcing a few bits and bracing the chassis so I could take it to the first Barndoor campout in the UK organised by Rikki James. \n<br>So, the full story of the bus is listed on the rides and projects thread on this link:\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=46441\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=46441</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>\n<br>Take a look through all the photos and info on there, its better to get the story first hand than a snapshot of it on an advert. So, what does the bus come with? All its original glass, including the impossible to find Plexiglass corner windows bar I think maybe 1 cab door glass from memory. It has 4 of its original 16’s on its original beam, hubs and trans, and comes with a barndoor samba donor rear clip, although I can knock a bit off if that is not needed as I can use that on my 15w. Sometimes it’s easier to use new metal, depends on personal preference. \n<br>\n<br>Yes it looks bad, but it is what it is, an extremely rare bus that can be built pretty easily by todays standards, with the quality of workmanship out there and the availability of high quality repair panels. Please do not compare this to some of the Columbian deluxes out there that have been for sale, as this is a totally different beast. Columbian busses are a lot of work as they have been kept on the road with gas welding for ½ a century, and while this is rusted, it is just rusted, you are not battling with tons of steel plate whacked on to make it work for just a few more years in the 60’s.\n<br>\n<br>So, to the price. I am looking for £45,000 for it OBO as it stands. I can deliver it, and viewing is no problem if you want to take a look. It is in Swansea. I have some photos I can send a link to interested parties, give me a bell on 07866618267 if interested. Happy to export once funds are cleared, just tell me where it’s got to go to and I can arrange the UK side. I can also be emailed on \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:streetwagens@yahoo.co.uk\">streetwagens@yahoo.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e -->. This really is someones dream bus, and possibly the only opportunity left to build a RHD barndoor samba. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/24H/P1040207.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/24H/IMG_7540.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/24H/P1040247.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
