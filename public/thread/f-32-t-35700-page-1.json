    "content" : "On the 14th December I made a change to the configuration of the forums that altered the way cookies are set. This may prevent some people logging in. The first thing to do is to delete your browser cookies that are associated with the forum. You can do that by clicking \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/cookiedelete.php\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> \n<br> \n<br>Alternatively (but not as easy) try the information on this site: \n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2\">http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=2</a>\n<!-- m --> \n<br> \n<br>Sorry for the inconvenience this may cause but it's an essential step to make way for some new features coming to the site later this year. \n<br> \n<br>If the problem isn't down to the change here is some more suggestions..... \n<br> \n<br>There are a number of reasons why you may have trouble logging in. \n<br>Some of these include: \n<br> \n<br>\n<strong>1) Cookie problems. </strong> \n<br> \n<br>To delete your forum cookies please click here: \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/cookiedelete.php\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">here</a> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>\n<strong>2) email address change</strong> \n<br>Have you changed the email address associated with your forum account? If so you will be temporarily locked out of the forum. Please mail the forum admins to get your account reactivated (address ssvcforum AT ssvc DOT org DOT uk). \n<br> \n<br>\n<strong>3) User error.</strong> \n<br>Make sure you type your password in correctly and with the same case (make sure you don't have Caps Lock on). If you think you may be using the wrong password, try the forgotten password link: \n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/profile.php?mode=sendpassword\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/profile.ph ... ndpassword</a>\n<!-- m --> \n<br> \n<br>\n<strong>4) Google Web Accelerator or similar product.</strong> \n<br>We have had a user have problems caused by Google Web Accelerator. There is a known problem with the accelerator that impacts phpbb forum users. Other similar products may have similar problems. \n<br> \n<br>\n<strong>5)Using the incorrect forum address to login with.</strong> \n<br>Make sure your login page has the \n<!-- w -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk\">www.ssvc.org.uk</a>\n<!-- w --> address (not the old ssvc.ukshells.co.uk address) \n<br> \n<br>If you're an Internet Explorer user it may also be worth trying another browser such as Firefox (\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/\">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/</a>\n<!-- m -->) to see if you have the same problems. \n<br> \n<br>If you are still having problems just drop a mail to the forum admins: \n<br>ssvcforum AT ssvc DOT org DOT uk. In the mail please could you give the following information: \n<br>\n<ul>\n Username\n <br>Internet service provider\n <br>Browser used (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari etc.) \n <br>Any add on tool bars installed in the browser\n <br>What error messages fo you get?\n <br>Have you checked the 5 points above?\n</ul> \n<br> \n<br>Cheers, \n<br> \n<br>John",
