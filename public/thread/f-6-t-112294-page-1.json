    "content" : "Hi\n<br>\n<br>Can someone confirm the operation of the stalk mounted headlight flasher on my 1967 splittie. Basically it only works when my lights are on and just switches between low and high beam. Nothing happens when I operate the flasher with the lights are off. Is this correct or should I be able to flash the headlamps even when the lights are off like a modern car?\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks",

    "content" : "The flasher function only works if there is a permanent live feed to the relay. US buses, including bays, were not fitted with this feed so the flasher didn't work when the lights were off. Some Euro buses were also wired like this. It's easy to fit a live feed to the relay providing you have the right 5 prong relay installed. I've just done this to couple of bays and a split. Look at the relay wiring in this list to identify the terminals. \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.jbugs.com/VW-Tech-Article-Headlight-Switches.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.jbugs.com/VW-Tech-Article-Headlight-Switches.html</a>\n<br>Look at Euro wiring diagrams on the Samba for the additional live feed info.",
