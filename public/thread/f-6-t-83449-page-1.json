    "content" : "Can someone give the correct layout of the fuel line from tank to carb. I only have one metal pipe. At the moment running from the Carb I have: Rubber pipe - metal pipe - small amount rubber pipe - filter (one end goes through firewall) rubber pipe to tank. I dont think that is right. \n<br> \n<br> Can and where from can I get the rubber firwall grommet as I dont have one at the mo. Have seen that I can use a bit of rubber pipe for the firewall if i have to.\n<br> \n<br> I take it I need a pipe clamp to stop loss of fuel? Is there a cunning plan to replace the pipe from the tank without it being empty?\n<br> \n<br> If I need more metal pipe sections where can I get some from.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers",

    "content" : "First of all, it's imperative you have the correct grade of fuel line - try Volksbolts (are on web and Ebay) - they do a kit that has all the correct clamps and hose you'll need to do the job...\n<br> \n<br> Order is (from tank)\n<br> \n<br> This is assuming stock single carb set up...\n<br> \n<br> Short length - 3 to 4\" then into an inline fuel filter - make sure it's the type that has barbed ends - if you've replaced the tank outlet spigot and filter and cleaned and sealed the tank you might not need the filter...\n<br> \n<br> Rubber hose long enough to go from the filter past/through the three tab clips on the underside of the cargo area\n<br> \n<br> Then a metal pipe all the way through the bulkhead, round the fan housing, passing through the HT cable guide (it's a specific part, don't just order what \"looks\" the right one as somebody may have done \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br> \n<br> After that it's a short run from the pipe with a bit of rubber hose to the fuel pump.\n<br> \n<br> Notes:\n<br> ALWAYS use new correct type and bore of hose and replace it annually\n<br> The steel pipe can be had from VW Heritage but it comes with different bends and is a bit of a cow to unbend cos it's Kunifer ie alloy steel pipe. You could probably get this from a motor factor or compressed air specialist I think it's 5.5mm od\n<br> New correct clamps on all joints\n<br> A P clip can be used on the LH fanhousing screw that the steel pipe will go past\n<br> ALWAYS put a grommet where the pipe passes through the bulkhead - again, Status, Heritage and M7 do the correct bit\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps",
