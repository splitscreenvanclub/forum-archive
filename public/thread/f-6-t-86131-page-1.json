    "content" : "Yeah, it was a hacked Racelogic box running a chopped down BMW V12 throttle body. The throttle pedal sensor was off a Transit and I bolted it under the cab floor and used a pushrod off the standard pedal. \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P8310225.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The throttle motor was mounted on the block and ran the Jenveys using a std CSP bellcrank linkage but with the throttle motor pretending to be the centre pillar.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P9050228.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I ran it for a year with alsorts of plans to introduce cruise control and integrate it with the DTA and use it to give me a controlled fast idle on cold start (if you do fast idle leaving a cracked throttle and then retard spark to slow it down then you waste fuel).\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, I started to find niggly problems pretty quickly. The throttle ECU couldn't compensate for the amount the block and heads expand as the engine heats up. So when it was cold it would bring the throttles down to sit on the idle stops but as the engine grew the ECU found that it could no longer pull the throttle back to where it thought fully closed should be and then it locked out on error. It was very difficult to set up and you had to have a laptop with you at all times to sort it out. Eventually one of the tracks on the position sensor in the motor packed up so it just locked out, when I was miles from home and it cost a packet to get the AA t tow the whole lot home.\n<br> \n<br> I've still got some of the bits and my pal's working on his own bespoke system so we can get better access to the strategy but its still messy if you want to run 2 throttles on opposite sides of the engine bay off 1 motor. I did find an Audi twin bosch E-gas throttle body at work but it was 2 x 54mm IIRC. Perhaps you could modify a jenvey type body with a motor, alternatively use a BMW E46 M3 throttle motor to drive a CSP linkage but that brings you back to the thermal growth problem again.\n<br> \n<br> What would you like to achieve with such a system Jim?",
