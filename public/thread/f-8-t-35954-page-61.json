have left it here, but I decided to fit a fuel cut off valve as well \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>So my original plan was to fit it between the tank and the fuel pump, which would be good incase of a crash, BUT my mate at work explained how a mechanical pump works, and that depending on where the pump stops, the spring inside it can either keep the pump shut, or try and squirt some extra petrol towards the carbs........so for this reason, I have decided to fit the valve between the pump and the pressure regulator \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>I would be interested what others think about where in the circuit I have put it, but to be honest as long as the fuel smell has gone, then I'm happy \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>I started by fitting inserts into the fan housing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a
