    "content" : "Hi, in the mot yesterday the guy was unhappy about the play in the top kingpin, and as they've had a rebuild he's worried about the strength etc. He advised not to drive too far.\n<br> I've stripped them all down and found pitted parts and bit of play, the hub carrier has bushes is this normal? The king pin spacer has different thickness about half way, is this normal? The link pins with needle bearings have play on the pins is this when the bearings are fitted is this normal, I'm trying to see if anything is salvageable im going to load up pictures so where do i go from here... oh and I'll tell you about the knock in the steering box later... got the drivers side to look at too\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

Had busy day yesterday, but managed to get time to rebuild them and dismantle them to work things out.\n<br> So I've ordered a new top king pin and bush and new link pins kit. One thing tho on Scholfields the king pins spacer (out of stock)comes in different sizes, mine has always had movement from the rebuild and no sign of oval wearing, cant this be bushed also as a precaution? \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
