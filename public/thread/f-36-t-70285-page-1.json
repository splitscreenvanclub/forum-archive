    "content" : "CIRCLE YER WAGENS IS BACK! \n<br>\n<br>For the fourth year running the Isle of Man VDub Club invites you to our VW event over the late May Bank Holiday weekend 2011 and we are looking forward to warmly welcoming old friends and new.\n<br>\n<br>We have once again managed to get a great deal with the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, and are able to offer an all-inclusive price of £215.00 for the weekend.\n<br>\n<br>This is the total price for a vehicle and 2 passengers on the ferry, up to four nights camping and quality Manx hospitality and entertainment! Extra adults are £42.00 and kids are £27.00.\n<br>\n<br>The Campsite is available for four nights from Thursday 26 May to Sunday 30 May inclusive. \n<br>\n<br>It will be held once again at Michael United Football club, a great location in the heart of Kirk Michael village, with lovely views over the mountains, close to the beach, shops and not least, the pub!!!\n<br>\n<br>The best option would be to travel to the Island from Belfast, Liverpool or Heysham on Thursday 26th, or from Liverpool/Heysham on Friday 27th. Return dates start from Sunday 29th to all three ports, but please phone the Steam Packet Holidays Team for all the details. You are welcome to extend your stay, add passengers, dogs etc to your booking. If you want to stay a little longer you will either need to arrange your own accommodation elsewhere or extra nights at the campsite. \n<br>\n<br>To book and for further info on travel etc. call the Steampacket Holidays team on 08457 585833\n<br>\n<br>If you would like to contact someone in the club please email \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:secretary@iomvdubclub.com\">secretary@iomvdubclub.com</a>\n<!-- e --> \n<br>\n<br>Some other useful links:\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.circleyerwagens.com/\">http://www.circleyerwagens.com/</a>\n<!-- m --> to keep you updated\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.steam-packet.com/\">http://www.steam-packet.com/</a>\n<!-- m --> for timetables only\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.visitisleofman.com/\">http://www.visitisleofman.com/</a>\n<!-- m --> for touristy stuff",
