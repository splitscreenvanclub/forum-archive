    "content" : "Wasn't looking for another Split was actually after another early bay Westy.. but a seller had 65 standard 11 window split that caught my eye so went to have a look. The van was in barn storage and was parked tightly behind '67 Deluxe which we had to pull forward. Had a look at the '65 and it didn't really do anything for me, so was on my way out and when helping move '67 back I asked if it was for sale, I have never considered a Deluxe before, I was asking more out of interest then seriously but when he told me it was for sale and priced at less then the 11W I opened my eyes properly to it..\n<br> \n<br>It was a Velvet Green/Pearl White 13 Window '67 Deluxe walk through with platinum Mesh interior.. instantly it shouted buy me and two days late I bought it home.. one of my more spontaneous purchases! \n<br>\n<br>This bus had been found in Oklahoma and was owned buy a 70 year old chap who had it in his barn. The story goes that some chaps where at a car show standing next to a 13 window deluxe, an old boy comes over to them and says I have one of these at home that he had been thinking of selling they go around the said old boys house house and a deal was done, it was then flipped and a imported to UK later stored for a while and now I own it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> I bought it from a very nice chap at Wagons West.. I felt like I was on that American Pickers TV show walking around his barns \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>What appealed to me was how untouched it was, 82K on the clock, OG paint, no welding done, no repairs, stock engine, one key fits all, hardly anything missing. What I didn't release until looking up the engine code and paper work it was also matching numbers and with its original engine which was nice.\n<br>It needed a battery tray, sills, bit of the cargo floor and couple of bits on the cab floor. There are a couple of dents on the front clip but I'm going to leave them as is.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway pics.. these pics are from the original guy the found the bus in Oklahoma\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1213004_zpswghzxh7a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1213003_zpsdqjqtqwg.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1213002_zpsqla3yj1q.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10462494_703980179650131_8980124030966010971_n_zpsnremnkom.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10502051_703980132983469_4786341102614956534_n_zpsehrkumst.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10479043_703980196316796_4634464596642456138_n_zpsdrs21xez.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10492377_703980109650138_4902866522365460015_n_zpsilpp1ahz.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10455996_703980266316789_3650308280763812694_n_zpslbs11rdd.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10452357_703980096316806_733576718257808277_n_zpstsss3a1d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10410743_703980016316814_6147848358014375709_n_zpsbyv4es9p.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10341965_703980039650145_5711303155912548319_n_zps0dyxe5yg.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/10302162_703980112983471_5774846218458629234_n_zpsemqfgkjg.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1213001_zpsteri6g5p.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1213000_zps5c7vphia.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/1212999_zpsudbncxia.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

Originally I blamed the old petrol/lack of petrol in the tank. Put some new fuel in and I had my timing strobe to hand as I had been doing my Bug the day before so thought I'd give it a look over. Looked up the distributor settings and the timing was massively out, surprised it was even starting at all. Spun it round timed it up and wow what an engine literally this engine starts on the button now.

I had already made the decision that I was not going to repaint this Bus so any work work have to be as minimal disturbance to the body and OG paint and then any bits hat did need painted would need blending in. Matt was sympathetic to my request and was happy with quote so booked it in. How ever to blend the paint it wasn't going to be a good idea to try and match up with the faded paint so it was time to machine polish the body. I got the side and rear end done but pulled a muscle in neck and took it to Matt as is.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/A53890CC-4563-4314-A9CB-4E3335377DA2_zpsh9zmv5iu.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/F9FBA445-E098-4D92-BE3F-2F06A4FC1C70_zpsdur5cs7m.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/DBDE356C-F1A8-4300-9A3B-3DCF7CE59343_zpscu4xyzrx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Beautiful\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/417854E9-6AB6-4373-A8D0-218D1424EE95_zpsz1vgqx83.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/6CCB714C-5EE6-462F-9F8C-C0E350A980D7_zpsat3cdbx8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/508F4C5C-3D8D-4D6C-BFFE-726A2279979C_zpsls8ijv5z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/38BFF0B3-0B38-4093-AFBD-23F6DF632119_zps3ff0htmq.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Uncovered the original dealer sticker on the tailgate which I was over moon with\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/67%20Deluxe/B530C302-BE8E-40F4-BC3C-96652E451DE7_zpssivzhw1w.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
