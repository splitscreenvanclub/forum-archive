    "content" : "Hi there folks,\n<br> I have just figured out how to post a general message after about an hour which included a private message I sent myself and another which just vanished. Anyway here goes third time lucky, I've not long had a 1966 splitscreen with a faulty speedometer. I bought a reconditioned one and changed it out to then find that it doesn't suit my 15\" wheels, the original ones mile counter stopped a few hundred miles ago and the needle sometimes does a full 360 degrees before falling back against the stop. Before joining SSVC I had read about a gentleman called Peter Banks who apparently fixed many of the VDO speedometers and wondered if anyone could point me in his direction assuming he still does this kind of thing.\n<br> I would appreciate any help offered by anyone and thank anyone who has taken the time to read this short novel.\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">",
