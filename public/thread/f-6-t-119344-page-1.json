    "content" : "I reckon it takes mine about 5 mins to get up to normal temperature.\n<br> \n<br> It's not a great way to warm the engine up though, especially if you've got an automatic choke. The choke opens up on a stepped gear.\n<br> \n<br> As the choke coil heats up, it unwinds and moves the stepped gear. If you just leave the engine idling, the throttle return spring holds the gear against a notch on the carb and the gear can't move, so the enine stays on full choke as it warms up.\n<br> \n<br> Better to drive it, or at least rev it every few seconds, so the gear frees up and can click round to open the choke up.\n<br> \n<br> Also, if you've got thermostatic flaps, the thermostat opening temperature is designed to match the rate that the automatic choke opens on normal driving.",
