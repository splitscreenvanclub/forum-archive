If you fit any later transmission in an early bus you'll need custom-made handbrake cables.\n<br> \n<br> I have a big nut (full synchromesh) gearbox in my '56 single cab. The previous owner found out that there aren't off the shelf cables for that combination. Unfortunately they thought it was sensible to run it without a handbrake, which would explain the whacking great dent in the engine lid and the mangled rear valance when I got it.\n<br> \n<br> I bought the longest cables available and cut off the factory swaged ends and fitted swageless wire rope studs after cutting the cables to length by eye. This sort of thing... \n<a href=\"http://www.wireropeassemblies.co.uk/itema4c6-2.html?cat_id=30&amp;prod_id=210&amp;dep=1\" class=\"postlink\">Swageless wire rope studs</a>\n<br> \n<br> A more professional solution would be to send them off to have fittings swaged on after you cut them to length, but the swageless ones haven't come loose yet. The only problem I've had is that the cables aren't exactly the same length, but the yoke takes up the difference.\n<br> \n<br> Edit, if you want a quick and dirty solution if the cables are too short, you can use some threaded bar and a coupler, but you might have to cut the existing fitting's thread down a bit to get enough clearance.",

    "content" : "The picture above is with the yoke the wrong way round. After flipping it round, the flat part that the nuts sit on will be roughly level with the mark on the bar that the yoke pivots on (between the end of the twist in that bar and where the yoke starts in the above picture).\n<br> \n<br> There aren't stock cables for later types of gearboxes in early buses. I think the clutch release arm is slightly further back (further away from the handbrake lever) so stock early cables come up short.\n<br> \n<br> Later buses use much longer cables because the handbrake adjuster is above the floor in the cabin so the cable has to reach round and up the handbrake lever. Those cables are too long for an early bus, even with a later gearbox. Custom cables are the only solution.\n<br> \n<br> I only know this because I found out the hard way \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",
