    "content" : "Ok, I know this question has been asked many, many times before, but discussions usually soon turn to 'OG is best!' I know this is true, but my van is being painted soon, and I don't want to have to wait for 6 months looking for a decent set! So, are all the repro sets the same quality? Heritage, Limebug, AAC etc. all seem to come in at around Â£250ish, but then the CE Engineering kit is so much more expensive. Does anyone have any practical experience with any of these kits, and is the CE kit worth the extra?\n<br>\n<br>Any opinions welcomed!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Adrian",
