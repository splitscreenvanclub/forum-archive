Or do I need to remove spring plates etc?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance.",

    "content" : "hi, Richard, feel sure you don't need to undo spring plates. just gear rod joint and clutch cable. have heard that it is not advisable to fit the eurethane mountings as they are to stiff, or was that for spring plate mounts. not sure of that now, someone will put me right on this. on reassembly you have to fix front rubber first then the two rear mounts. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",

Seen lots recently upside down for some reason...\n<br> \n<br> If yours hasn't got the 15mm nut on upper nose cone stud, then getting a 17mm spanner in there is tricky.",

    "content" : "<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>vwJim wrote:</cite>If you fit it to the nose cone first, then you can't get it wrong.\n </div>\n</blockquote> Which is quite correct - the mount has a very thin lip on three sides and the nosecone fits snugly into the lip. It's very easy to see when the box is out and the mount is in your hand. The way to check if your mount is already bolted to the chassis is to feel the face of the mount as it points at the back of the bus and you should have the lip at the bottom.",
