Apparently these are very rare and were fitted as an option on 62 - 66 vans (with writing around key hole - Spanish in this case I think) whereas there is no writing \n<br>I think the part number etched on the side is 211 905 851E with other marks being 2KG Pat No 67007.\n<br>on the 67 version. \n<br>This item is advertised elsewhere so I retain the tight to withdraw the item if sold.\n<br>Additional postage will be charged for overseas delivery.",
