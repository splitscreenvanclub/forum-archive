    "content" : "Hi All\n<br>\n<br>I have just imported this beast, but bad timing means it has to go. She hasnt been Registered yet (she only arrived last Tuesday).\n<br>\n<br>I have all the import docs and Invoices, all she needs is an MOT and the £55 fee.\n<br>\n<br>I was going to fix her up and keep her, but the shipping took longer than anticipated and I'm moving to the farm on the weekend.\n<br>\n<br>She is a genuine Sundial camper with a 3/4 R+R bed, all clad in wood.\n<br>\n<br>Needs tidying. For more details, call me on 07834 981622.\n<br>\n<br>I want £7500 for her.\n<br>\n<br>She is rock solid underneath, not rott or rust. Just the paint work is ..... Needs a bit of the electrics sorting too (lighting). She has the original \"All Transistor\" radio. Heaters work.\n<br>\n<br>Call me if interested, too much to put on here.\n<br>\n<br>Paul\n<br>\n<br>Badly repaired bit of damage. Doors shut fine though.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/DSC00518.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/DSC00498.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_-_8-1_019.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/DSC00526.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/DSC00527.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_-_8-1_024.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_9-5_014.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_-_8-1_014.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_-_8-1_002.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/paologray/VW_-_8-1_001.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
