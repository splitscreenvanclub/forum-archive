All the cabinets are in great condition with the added patina of 45 years of use. \n<br>\n<br>It is cleaning up well, so far it appears all the latches, catches and handles etc are there.\n<br>\n<br>I am still curious about how the cargo door table works? I remember reading that the little stand is detachable, I have what looks like it may be it, a small table/stand with little hooks on it. I'm wondering if it hooked into a couple of small brackets that were mounted on the cargo door and then the stand supported by a cable support or something, very hard to see in the brochures.\n<br>\n<br>Will post photos as I clean it all up.\n<br>\n<br>The main table is in very good condition and has the 5 leg plates.\n<br>\n<br>Who would ever have thought an original Torvette interior would show up, amazing.",
