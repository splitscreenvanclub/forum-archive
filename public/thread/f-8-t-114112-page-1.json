    "content" : "Hi All,\n<br>\n<br>I, like all of us love the VW Splitty. I currently drive a VW T5.1 Day van for everyday use and love it. Having played with the idea of purchasing a Splitty for many a year, I finally took the plunge a month or so before Christmas. The van has been dry stored by a friend of mine, for approximately 20 years and is in pretty good shape from a bodywork prospective. Having bought the van, I now find myself getting slightly cold feet, regarding the time and money that it will cost to bring her back to life. I will be out-saucing the jobs and could really do with some good advise on....\n<br>\n<br>1 order in which to do jobs\n<br>2 people that can be recommended for the work\n<br>3 any other advice .you feel I should know\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11811&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11811&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0106.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0106.JPG (111.51 KiB) Viewed 647 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11810&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11810&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0107.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0107.JPG (93.6 KiB) Viewed 647 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11812&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11812&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0108.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0108.JPG (90.75 KiB) Viewed 647 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11813&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11813&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0109.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0109.JPG (114.78 KiB) Viewed 647 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11814&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11814&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ebb22662c11ef015d8287f88fab668a7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0110.JPG\" title=\"IMG_0110.JPG (99.86 KiB) Viewed 647 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",

    "content" : "It has a mixture of 62 and 63 features.\n<br>\n<br>Either its a 63 with earlier rear arches and outie engine vents. Or its a 62 with later front arches (a more common occurrance particularly on older restos where correct early thick lip arches weren't available). Or it's on the cusp of 62 and 63 (e.g. August 1962) and has a mixture.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, as type21f says, the order of things to do next is:\n<br>\n<br>1. find out exactly what bus you have - start by finding the m-code behind the drivers seat on the bulkhead and decode it here: \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.vw-mplate.com/mcode.php\">http://www.vw-mplate.com/mcode.php</a>\n<!-- m --> For example if you have an original RHD 1962/3 Dormobile then it is probably rarer than a barndoor samba; however it is statistically more likely you have a microbus standard with a roof cut in.\n<br>\n<br>2. based on what it turns out you have, decide what you want to do with it - do you want a workhorse daily driver, a nice weekend camper, a show car, or an authentic and accurate piece of history. Costs go up acordingly. Ask me how I know...\n<br>\n<br>3. based on what you want to do with it, decide on how much you want to spend on it. Then check you have access to at least 50% more than that so you don't have to stop the resto when you run out of money. Ask me how I know...\n<br>\n<br>4. decide how much of the work you can / want to do yourself. If you are putting a fun daily driver together you might attempt a lot yourself, if you are building to show standard you might invest in more professional help.\n<br>\n<br>5. based on all of the above, decide on the best people to help you. You get what you pay for, so recommendations for a top restorer will leave your bank account empty and your bus winning prizes; likewise recommendations for a local reliable welder will suit you better if you want ad hoc help with the tricky bits of a weekend project you can't manage yourself.\n<br>\n<br>6. once you've deceded everything above you can decide on all the other things like what order to do it in. For example some higher end restorers will assemble mechanically ...then disassemble to do the bodywork ...then reassemble mechanically knowing that everything will fit perfectly and they don't have to damage any of the paint to fit it all up again. This is worth it if you're puting £10k of man hours into the paint; but is time consuming extra step if you are only throwing £200 of paint at it in your single garage. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sorry if this is telling you things you already know, just I know I didn't when I first got my bus.",
