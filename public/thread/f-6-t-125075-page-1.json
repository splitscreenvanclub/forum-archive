The 1100 idle could be masking various things. Set the tappets. Get the carb linkage balanced and screws adjusted evenly if its twin carbs. Set idle down to 900'ish and the timing. Then go from there. Might have a gasket sucked in on the inlet which is causing the idle issue if its not simply poor adjustments.",
