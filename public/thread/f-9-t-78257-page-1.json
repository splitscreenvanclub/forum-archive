    "content" : "I can recommend Avebury in Wiltshire as well if you're interested in Stonehenge (more hands on, bigger &amp; less touristy). \n<br>Also Bath is beautiful City &amp; full of history &amp; interesting things to do (Roman baths, cool shops, interesting architecture) . There are a couple of good castles. Corfe castle is good (rat look castle!) &amp; there are a couple of nice beaches &amp; good walks nearby (Lulworth cove, Durdle door). The historic docks in Portsmouth are also good for a look round.\n<br>Personally I wouldn't be too worried about having your van stolen, just be sensible, park somewhere safe &amp; well lit &amp; have some sort of deterent, steering wheel lock etc.\n<br>Hope you have a fantastic trip, I'll PM you my number if you have any problems give me a shout &amp; hopefully I can point you in the right direction! \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",

Then a bit further along is Brighton which is a popular tourist spot with a decent beach (if you like stoney beaches) if you like sandy beaches then camber sands is nice and is a short drive from Dover on the way to Hastings.",
