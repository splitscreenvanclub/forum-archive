Is it split or bay ?\n<br>\n<br>The condition is ok a couple is small tears in the seats and some water damage to the cabinets, the side cabinet has the mirror and cost hooks still, fold out table has its leg and hinge is good!\n<br>\n<br>And finally what's it worth ? I'm taking it to slough to sell as a job lot.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1279.photobucket.com/user/Blastingdiepast/media/Mobile%20Uploads/2014-09/A4B939B0-B22B-4EEF-8E59-408F7D0A4E7F_zpsm3rtkkwx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1279.photobucket.com/albums/y525/Blastingdiepast/Mobile%20Uploads/2014-09/A4B939B0-B22B-4EEF-8E59-408F7D0A4E7F_zpsm3rtkkwx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
