I'm thinking of doing the Bay first and trying to persevere with aircooled on the Split, ultimately getting a 1776cc motor for it.\n<br>\n<br>I'm just fed up with never having a stress free journey and the missus has absolutely NO faith in either of the vans \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<br>\n<br>Both the engines have been cobbled together by dicks (especially the Splittys) and I'm trying to do what I can but I'm no engine expert \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> , mechanically I'm good but I just don't have the experience with motors and no-one I know does and there is no \"aircooled scene\" in Aberdeen what so ever \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<br>\n<br>I think going for a modern EFI engine would save me so much grief in the long run and will be cheap for me to do as I'm a CNC machinist and will make nearly all the bits for the conversion myself.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Paddy",

    "content" : "I went Subaru powered 2 years ago and have not looked back. Its a ball ache to fit the rad in an area of high air flow but once that is sorted its reasonably plain sailing. Be ready for lots of unexpected little problems (and unforseen additional costs) and you'll need a few shake down runs before you can be satisfied that everythings working perfectly, but once its sorted its a great feeling knowing you can get in a 50 year old vehicle and keep up with modern traffic and have proper heating etc. I also fitted disks all round and power steering at the same time so my conversion is a little more in depth than most people would be comfortable with.

Buying a complete car enables u to chop the loom about and keep engine running so if u cut wrong wire u know where your upto and u know the mileage.Does take time though.Dimensionally a perfect fit slight trimming of rear valance required.U will more than likely need to upgrade your gearbox as, 2.2 is around 145bhp and 139 torque.Some people with healthy boxs have no issues (dependant on how u drive) .",

Everything was a hassle though - loads of fabrication (obviously not a problem for you), lots of parts sourcing and a lot of 'trial &amp; error' testing! The motor I used wasn't EFI so the wiring was fairly straight-forward, I'd hate to think what wiring in an ECU would involve. \n<br>\n<br>Don't be put off by the luddites, it's your bus after all. Having said that, I did find it quite difficult to sell - it was a case of finding someone who saw the conversion as a bonus rather than a negative point.\n<br>\n<br>I'm staying aircooled with my splitty, primarily because I'd rather use it than spend time working on it (although I seem to do plenty of that anyway!)",
