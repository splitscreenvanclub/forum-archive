Now if I wanted to sale- would I say 'no thats far too much money you can have it for £xx'--- I think not!!!!! It is all about market forces and desirabilty. If as an individual you feel you paid what it is worth to \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">you </span>then that is all that matters. I would be prepared to pay over the odds for a Barndoor but not a Samba- some else would do the opposite.",
