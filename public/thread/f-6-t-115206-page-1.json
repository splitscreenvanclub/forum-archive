Are they discontinued?\n<br>\n<br>And before I place an order direct to the USA, does anyone stock A1's in the UK/Europe? Numerous searches would suggest not!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks In advance \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

The slim line sump sat lower than any part of the system.\n<br>However, I thought I saw one on the VW Speedshop website last week though. They've redesigned the tailpipe angle to reduce resonance on buses.",
