    "content" : "That's unlikely mate! Cheers for the comments though!\n<br>\n<br>Right I have a spare ten minutes so here's an update of the specs of my 1957 samba originally from Luxembourg.....\n<br>\n<br>From back to front.....\n<br>\n<br>1600 blow through turbo motor build by myself (covered 2k miles).....\n<br>\n<br>-CB 044 35 x 40 ported heads.\n<br>-HD pushrods.\n<br>-Autocraft 1:25 rockers.\n<br>-New 1600 pistons &amp; barrels.\n<br>-Berg 30mm oil pump with full flow cooling, external Fram HP1 filtration &amp; mesa 16 row cooler.\n<br>-Full set of Autometer Cobalt gauges including a/f gauge &amp; lambda.\n<br>-Flowed &amp; de-choked Renault 5 turbo carb.\n<br>-Full stainless boost pipes.\n<br>-CB breather.\n<br>-Gene Berg counterweighted crank pulley. \n<br>-Bosch uprated electric fuel pump.\n<br>-Charge cooler with Golf VR6 auxiliary water pump &amp; 2 x YZ 125 radiators for cooling.\n<br>-CB performance turbo header.\n<br>-Garrett T3 turbo with 360 degree thrust bearing, new genuine Garrett core &amp; staggered rear oil seal.\n<br>\n<br>Running gear.....\n<br>\n<br>-1303's' I.R.S gearbox.\n<br>-Intermediate gearbox mount.\n<br>-Full creative I.R.S with adjustable spring plates.\n<br>-Fully rebuilt 68 bay hubs with new drums, shoes, cables, wheel cylinders &amp; bearings.\n<br>-Braided brake hoses all round.\n<br>\n<br>-Dubfabs 4\" narrowed beam with multi fit shock towers.\n<br>-My own 3 1/2\" dropped spindles.\n<br>-CSP 14\" wheel drilled &amp; vented disk brake kit.\n<br>-Creative rack &amp; pinion steering.\n<br>\n<br>Info on other accessories/bits with the bus.....\n<br>\n<br>-Bosch scripted front fog light.\n<br>-NOS genuine deluxe mirrors.\n<br>-Harp mirror arms.\n<br>-6 x genuine pop-outs with o.g big spoon latches. \n<br>-Original semaphores. \n<br>-All interior &amp; exterior handles are o.g for a bit of patina!\n<br>-One key fits all locks, with a spare included.\n<br>\n<br>Interior.....\n<br>\n<br>-Original front bench seat in original material, expertly repaired by J&amp;S upholstery.\n<br>-Westfalia rock &amp; roll bed.\n<br>-Full set of 'subtle' J&amp;S Upholstery curtains which cover every window. \n<br>-Chequered lino floor.\n<br>-Basic hardboard 'door cards'.\n<br>-Fully re-done West Coast Metric headliner.\n<br>-Fully recovered mohair sunroof with o.g Golde handle.\n<br>-Blaupunkt Hamburg Bluetooth/MP3/CD player. Blaupunkt component speakers in the front &amp; Blaupunkt 6x9's in the rear.\n<br>\n<br>Exterior.....\n<br>\n<br>-All photographs documenting work &amp; showing lead loading of the replacement panels.\n<br>-N.O.S cab doors.\n<br>-O.g front panel unpicked, repaired, lead loaded then replaced.\n<br>-Full repaint of top half in gloss Chestnut Brown and the bottom half in Satin Sealing Wax Red for a bit of a patina look, this could easily be repainted in gloss.\n<br>-All o.g glass apart from 2 pop-outs, I had to source these as the bus would originally only have 2 pop-outs.\n<br>-All new seals.\n<br>-Genuine ribbed bumpers painted in gloss sealing wax red (the rears need the correct slash-cut trim). I have the painted splash pans for the rear.\n<br>-O.g wiper arms &amp; spindles.\n<br>\n<br>Electrical.....\n<br>\n<br>-Full new wiring loom.\n<br>-Recent starter motor.\n<br>-Good 'correct' Euro spec rear lights.\n<br>-Late U.S spec front lights with H4 halogen inserts - these really are uber bright as commented by the guy in front of at Vanfest! \n<br>-O.g centre brake light housing &amp; bezel.\n<br>-Bumper mounted o.g Bosch horn. \n<br>-Alternator conversion.\n<br>\n<br>O.K. so here's the deal. Although this isn't the world's most original early Samba (good luck finding one for less than 60 grand!), I feel there is enough scope to return this bus close to original spec. I built the bus for me and only me, I never planned on selling this bus but times &amp; needs change so here it is. The upgrades/changes I have made were based on improving the look and drive of the bus. I know this bus is priced on the nose but there are bits I would ideally like to keep and am willing to negotiate on, namely the wheels, brakes, engine &amp; gauges. The bus can be supplied on Crows Feet wheels if required &amp; I also have a set of Randars kicking about. I am going to do an early bay I have as a stop gap and these bits will work with what I have in mind for that, so no problem either way!\n<br>\n<br>There are probably some other bits I've forgotten but feel free to call me on 07773 010 061 after 4pm if you're interested.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers.\n<br>\n<br>Gill.",
