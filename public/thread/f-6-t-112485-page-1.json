The only problem is this lovely piece of reproduction tat stalk still won't work correctly.. (Won't stay in the left turn position)\n<br>\n<br>So...I have bought a stalk from a 67 bus but turns out its a UK spec on with 6 wires rather than the 9 I was expecting.\n<br>\n<br>Does anyone know a way to wire a UK stalk onto US bus? \n<br>Do I need to junk the 9 wire relay and go to the relays used on UK busses? \n<br>\n<br>Many thanks in advance \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
