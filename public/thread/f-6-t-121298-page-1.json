Iv never driven the split or a 1500... My old bay had a 1600 sp I contemplated the Weber’s for that but never got around to it.\n<br> I’m not expecting quicker speeds but wondered if the twins will make much difference when it comes to hills etc?\n<br> I do plan to build a devon interior for it as well.\n<br> Any info, advice or experience would be greatly appreciated.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> Russ\n<br> \n<br> The bus.....",

I was thinking about a slightly larger single carb mainly as I don’t have what the engine is supposed to have haha",

    "content" : "Twin ICTs work well on a 1500sp but the sp monifolds may need some work to get them sealing well, as they are not the best quality. I've run ICTs on 1500sp engines but Dell FRDs are much better, smoother acceleration and easier to set up. You will get a good power increase but slightly higher fuel consumption with ICTs.",
