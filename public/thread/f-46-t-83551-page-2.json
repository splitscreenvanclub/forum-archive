Upside down. I recently bought one off a67man. I'm sure he had another.\n <br>\n <img src=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f62/ALANSCOTTGRAHAM/56f98421.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n <br>\n <br>\n <br>Here's how the cooker top fits to my door using those detachable hinges.\n <br>\n <img src=\"http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f62/ALANSCOTTGRAHAM/f2e6d664.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>That's perfect! Thanks Al, and thanks for showing the pic of it in place as a table- I had no idea that was what they were designed to do! Every day is a school day!\n<br> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Don't suppose anyone has any spare hinges for the table on the cargo door do they???? \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Seth",
