    "content" : "hi guys,\n<br>i am looking for advice and pics of anyone that has a 1915cc motor regarding venting rocker covers/oil fillers and venting to carb air filters/ or expansion tank.\n<br>i am looking to have a tidyish engine bay so am looking for ideas of the best route to have pipes/hoses etc.\n<br>also if i need to make holes in tinware for pipes will it effect the cooling at all.\n<br>many thanks\n<br>rob",

    "content" : "No harm in venting the rocket covers. Do it at the top corner, flywheel end. Then cut two holes in the tinware that fits over the flywheel and run hoses to the breather tower. Make sure the breather tower is vented either to carb air cleaners or a small filter so it's under atmospheric pressure.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
