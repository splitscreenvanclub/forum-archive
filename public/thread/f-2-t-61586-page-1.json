A lot of US suppliers are happy to give the goods a lesser value than actual but as already said, if it comes to an insurance claim you're stuffed re true cost. You need to be aware that VAT is charged on the shipping cost as well as the goods \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>eg. TK engine $4000, shipping $500, VAT payable on $4500. It makes a difference on big items.\n<br>I have known 1 person to argue successfully that the original country of manufacture of a beetle they imported from the US was Germany and being an EU country therefor shouldn't pay VAT. Still had to pay VAT on the shipping cost tho'.",
