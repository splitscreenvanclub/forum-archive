It won't steer, brake or accelerate like a modern car. It will be noisy and the gearchange will be a whole new experience for you.\n<br> You will however be buying a car that will make you grin every time you get in it, strangers will talk to you at petrol stations, people take your photo as you sit waiting at traffic lights or as they overtake you on the motorway. Get used to sitting at 60mph and wondering what the hurry is as everything else rushes ahead.\n<br> It sounds like you are about to start on a very steep learning curve, enjoy it, the technology is mostly pre-war. It's just a pile of bits bolted together, there's nothing that can't be fixed and there are plenty of people here and in the club that are happy to help.",
