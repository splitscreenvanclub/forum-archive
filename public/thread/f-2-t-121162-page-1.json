A quick google hasn’t yielded any results but I’m sure there must be some suppliers that cater for this market aren’t there?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Steve",

I hope I’m reading that correctly but I’ll drop them a note to ask. I have a feeling the 5v will be a usb charger however so any info still welcome.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lifeline-Ampstore-Classic-Car-Jump-Starter-and-Emergency-Power-Pack-/132232162989\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lifeline-Amp ... 2232162989</a>",
