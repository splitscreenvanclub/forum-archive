    "content" : "Hi all not posted for a long time. I've got an SO-42 tin top non walk through. There's a couple of missing items and the biggest piece I am missing is the jump seat. Ive been on the look out for one for years but had no luck. I did try reprowesty but with the shipping costs it would have been far too expensive option for me to have one made. Anyway I've given up now and bought a cheap jump seat for a walk through model just to have something next to the cool box. I may try and get someone to widen this at a later date so it fits my bus, but in the meantime what do you think would look good or be practical to fill the gap between seat and cool box?\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk",
