    "content" : "These are essentially new tyres as in the title they have done 0000 miles! They are Jinju 195/70/R15 light truck tyres and were fitted to my bus while it was getting painted and welded, I have now fitted slam tyres as it is getting lowered next week so these are surplus to requirements. For sale at the bargain price of £100 for all four tyres, sorry no offers as these are already rock bottom price for four amazing tyres.

    "content" : "My bus was stock when these were fitted, I have since straight axled and am fitting dropped spindles on the front. They are I believe stock profile tyres for buses that had 15\" wheels, they were fitted to brand new BRM's and taken off as I say to fit low profile tyres. The '70' part of the tyre code is the height from the rim. There was no rubbing or clearance issues at stock height, and if I was keeping it stock I would be keeping the tyres. I hope that answers your questions ok, many thanks.",

A Radial equivalent to the stock crossplies would be a 195/\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">80</span>/15, this would maintain standard gearing.\n<br>\n<br>To the chap who asked about rubbing - these tyres will definitely not rub the arches of any stock height bus as they are slightly smaller than the standard tyres (which also don`t rub) \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
