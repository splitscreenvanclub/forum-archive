    "content" : "Hi Mark,\n<br>\n<br>I think it is the 10” but, unlike others for sale at the time, that wasn't in the item's title (on ebay) but the seller's description sounded promising. As a double check, I asked the seller to make another, unambiguous measurement for me, which they kindly did, which gave me more confidence to order. If possible, I think I'd still aim to double check the length with your seller. Perhaps the easiest measurement to ask for is with the mounting plates fully tucked under, as per the photo, the overall length of the original is 10”. For the replacement, as I think you can just see in the photo, this measurement is a tiny bit longer.\n<br>\n<br>Kind regards,\n<br>Peter",
