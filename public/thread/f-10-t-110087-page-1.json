    "content" : "Hi everyone,\n<br>I am pretty sure I have seen some of you at previous CarFests and wondered if you can help? We are the Karmann Beetle Owners Club GB and have a pitch sevured at CarFest North July 31st to August 2nd, Oulton Park, but only have three cars, due to the clash with a tattoo Park.\n<br>Are any of you keen to bring a Van and/or Beetle/Karmann? We need two more.\n<br>The cost is only Â£156 for two people all weekend, plus a share of the camping pitch cost. This will depend on numbers camping but is not a lot. Camping would be in the Car Club site and you can bring a camper van or small caravan onto the site (not easy if buying tickets through the Breakfast Show). The Show vehicle and a back up one are included in the price. Children under 6 are free, but wristbands for over 6's depend on numbers nearer the time.\n<br>Please email me on \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:sal_wildeuk@yahoo.co.uk\">sal_wildeuk@yahoo.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e --> if you are interested.it's a fantastic event and very much a family one.
