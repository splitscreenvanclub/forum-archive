    "content" : "For sale, recently imported RHD Kenyan bus.\n<br>\n<br>Please see the below as a guideline, we would expect anyone interested to come and view the van in person\n<br>\n<br>Please view the van as a project and understand that in order to make the vehicle excellent a great deal of work will be required. \n<br>\n<br>The bus has not in our opinion been bent above the cargo doors, however what has happened is that the nearside roof has rotted out significantly and this is evident all the way along. Over the doors a crude homemade repair panel has been made to repair the roof and the frame over the top of the doors, and this panel is not straight and has been fashioned by hand not with a metal folder. It therefore foolows the curve that is evident on the outside. There is no evidence of impact in the roof or the cargo doors and floor.\n<br>\n<br>The inside of most panels are visible and therefore when viewing you will be able to see the quality of the external panels, the sides, rear and cargo doors are all reasonable, doors and front panel carry battle scars.\n<br>\n<br>For a complete body restoration of the van you would need in the very least:\n<br>\n<br>• Rear and nearside roof sections\n<br>• Cargo floor\n<br>• 1 or possibly 2 doors\n<br>• Front end panel\n<br>• Box section behind front panel between chassis rails\n<br>• Cab floor\n<br>• Outer front wheel arches\n<br>• Inner and outer sills\n<br>• Repairs to some of the side panel lower sections\n<br>• Repairs to inner wheelarches\n<br>• Repairs to front door frames\n<br>• Repairs or replacement out riggers\n<br>• Repairs to at least 2 parts of the main chassis rails.\n<br>• Repair to the floor over the engine where a small access panel has been cut and bent over the fuel tank sender\n<br>• There would be numerous localised repairs that I cannot at the moment see, but im sure would become apparent if the shell was blasted.\n<br>\n<br>Although the bus runs, drives, stops and all the electrics work, obviously a complete overhaul of all components for these areas would likely be required.\n<br>\n<br>The engine is a non original engine listed as 1.6 on the logbook, probably from a beetle or bay window van.\n<br>\n<br>The bus has working safari front windows and all the other windows are there although they would need frames / catches repairing or replacing and new seals throughout although.\n<br>\n<br>Many of the fittings and fixtures are not original and originals would need sourcing.\n<br>\n<br>You do still get a free African party light...\n<br>\n<br>NOVA cert will be through in the next 2 weeks at the latest and obviously needs to be in place before a sale is completed... \n<br>\n<br>We are looking for offers around £10,500.00\n<br>\n<br>We also have a a very clean late bay with a westy roof and a camping interior if anyone is interested...\n<br>\n<br>Please ask any questions or request more photos, the bus is in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire and viewings are welcome.\n<br>\n<br>You can call me on 07908716772 or mail me on \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:tom@afrikombi.co.uk\">tom@afrikombi.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e --> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_1988.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_1990.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_1991.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_1992.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_1997.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_2002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/IMG_2004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc415/fodtommo/20150709_221535_resized.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

If that bus was stripped to a shell and dipped in a stripper tank any good restorer in the UK would probably advise you to find another bus because that bus is beyond economical restoration.",
