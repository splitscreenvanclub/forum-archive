[Air-ride, Turbo, Charge-cooled, EFI, 310BHP, maintenance, upkeep, the list goes on and on.]\n<br> \n<ul>\n <li>When I drive it in the wet I get truly p1ssed off at how wet my feet get with safari \"issues\".</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>The turbo means no heat exchangers so it gets bloody cold in the cabin.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>The thing drinks fuel as if it's free, particularly when I put my foot down, which is often.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>New noises are quantified by cost; \"<em class=\"text-italics\">Oohh that sounds like an expensive noise. Best look at that</em>\" or \"<em class=\"text-italics\">That's a cheap noise. Turn the stereo up</em>\"</li>\n</ul> We recently spent 4 weeks driving around the Alps and Pyrenees hitting 2800m and travelling 2200KM. During that time due to the roads we traveled on, I didn't particularly enjoy the experience. It certainly wasn't relaxing!\n<br> \n<br> On our return, I dropped £55k on a 2018 demonstrator California with 1100 miles on the clock. \n<ul>\n <li>In the wet my feet don't get wet.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>I have climate control in the rear, front and remote controlled heating.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>I'm getting 45mpg on a run.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>Any new noises I experience in the next 3 years are paid for by VAG.</li>\n</ul> \n<ul>\n <li>It's got \"upstairs\" and \"downstairs\" for more comfort and negate the need to keep moving things to the front seats.</li>\n</ul> Here's the kicker. \n<br> I don't look at it and think \"That's cool\"\n<br> I look at it and think \"Yeah. It's a works van. An expensive works van.\"\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">It doesn't make me smile.<br> It's just not the same.</strong>\n<br> \n<br> It turns out despite all its woes, I quite like my splittie \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_compress.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":compress:\" title=\"compress\">",
