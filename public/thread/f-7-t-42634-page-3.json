    "content" : "Sorry for not replying to you all sooner. \n<br>Basically my van was found by chance. A builder was under investigation as houses he was renovating were getting burgled. When the police busted the builders house, they found my van in his garage. Church lane Ashington. THe Vin plate was removed and vin plate making equipment was also found. However I have since been advised by the police that he is going to get away with it, he claims he was storing the van for a friend. He will not give the name of the friend to the police. I have no idea why he didnt get rid of my van very odd, but im very lucky. So Trevor (thats my vans name) as from today is back on the road, and wants somewhere to go this saturday. Any events that arnt miles away, please suggest. \n<br>\n<br>Thank you all for keeping a beedy look out,\n<br>I'll see you soon. \n<br>Also does anyone know of anyone who has a lock up I can rent. \n<br>Vx",

The criminal justice system sees car car crime as very low down, even if it breaks your heart and your bank. And he would have served the sentences 'concurrently', at the same frigging time.
