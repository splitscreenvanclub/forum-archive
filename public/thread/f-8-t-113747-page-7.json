Drive like a dream too, Still got some troubles though, hub seal was not fully seated so was rubbing on the brake springs and fourth gear is noisy and keeps popping out and flywheel seal is leaking badly. Luckily I have a spare box so have sent v55 of this afternoon and will drop the engine and box next week, fingers crossed I should have it done by the time the reg comes back. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
