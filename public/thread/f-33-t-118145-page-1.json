On one of them I actually thought I got it as I was highest bidder with 1 second to go then it jumped from £268 to £304 but the bid increments throughout were only £4. \n<br> To be honest, it actually ***** me off a bit as I don't think its really in the spirit of things.",

    "content" : "Snipe bidding as it's referred to is usually in the buyers best interest. Putting bids in early gives other buyers time to think and perhaps raise their highest bid. Result is always in the sellers favour.\n<br> Would you have bid higher for the item given the time to think?\n<br> If the answer is \"yes\" then you really need to change the way you bid. Ebay's no longer a traditional auction site. Think of it as a sealed bid. Put in your highest bid in the final stages and let fate take it's course. If you lose then obviously someone else was willing to pay more for it.",

In other words it continues timewise until only one person is left standing. eBay as you know operates differently with a fixed cut off time. Therefore to increase your chances of being successful you need to ditch your principles about bidding programs and comparisons with auction houses and run with it. Why on earth did you put a bid in 5 days before it finished? This alerts other people who may be interested in the item that you are in the hunt for it. Why show your hand? You state that an auction should be won by the person who is prepared to pay the most -it is in eBay's case - you bid X pounds (the amount shown by your username) plus £5, you were outbid at the end by someone willing to pay more than £X+5.\n<br> I use exactly the same tactics as friedgreedo above. Some you win, some you don't but that's life!",
