    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>I need some help with an Easicool \"Camper\" cooler - the small one, not the fitted one.\n<br>\n<br>We just picked up one of these coolers, and just have a couple of questions:\n<br>\n<br>I poured a cup of water in the top part as per the instructions, and left it outside to get a flow of air round it. Now, the outside metal case is cool to the touch, but the inside has not got any cooler at all.\n<br>\n<br>I left it 24 hours, then poured some more water in the top (ensuring it wasn't overfilled) and left for another 24 hours, but still the same result.\n<br>\n<br>Questions:\n<br>1) Is the inside supposed to get cool as well, or only if there's \"chilled\" food in it already?\n<br>2) Is the white insulation stuff inside the casing supposed to flap around loosely?\n<br>\n<br>We only paid a fiver for it, but if it's not working, that's a fiver I'd want back.\n<br>\n<br>Any help appreciated,\n<br>\n<br>Carl.",
