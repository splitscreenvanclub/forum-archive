Does the spacer late sit on top of the reverse lock out plate, or does that go on top of the spacer plate?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for clarifying.",

    "content" : "I have one of the original VS shifters which I think are slightly different to the latest design. However on mine to secure the stick, wind down the nut to the bottom on the thread (nearest to the floor) then wind on your stick. Get your stick set at the most comfortable position for you, and then wind back up the nut so that it jambs tight against the end of the stick, thus locking it into place. Before you do any of that though, apply some loctite to all threads. They have a habit of becoming loose if you don't. Remember, there's always a little slop feel in the VS shifters. This is due I believe to the lift to reverse mechanism incorporated into the design. \n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps.",
