    "content" : "Foe Sale - Old Blue\n<br> Right hand drive, de-seemed 11 window\n<br> Was de-seamed and the rear hatch welded up in south africa by the surfer dude who owned it previously. \n<br> It is solid underneath, but there is starting to be some rust showing on the body. Hopefully the pictures will show this. It did however pass its MOT only a month ago, so nothing drastic.\n<br> \n<br> I bought the bus about 5 years ago for about £10,000 and have spent about another £12-15k since on mainly stuff you dont see, but its what makes this bus fast and reliable. If you are after a reliable, quick bus that stops as well, then this is a cheap option to get you going.\n<br> \n<br> Spec is as follows:\n<br> Strictly Foreign 2276 engine with all the top spec you'd expect.\n<br> External oil rad with electric fan\n<br> Bears Motorsport gear box which was built to match the engine with the target of 1/4 mile in under 17 seconds and cruise comfortably at 70.\n<br> New type 3 rear brakes\n<br> New Straight Axle conversion from T2D\n<br> New Adjustable plates\n<br> New disc brakes up front\n<br> New top quality brake lines through out\n<br> New brake cylinder\n<br> New shocks all round\n<br> Narrowed beam and dropped spindles up front\n<br> Porsche 356 wheels (two with hub caps)\n<br> New Creative Engineering steering column\n<br> New Motolito steering wheel\n<br> Porsche sets up front\n<br> New Auto fire extinguisher in the engine bay\n<br> New Monster sound system (think 3000watts) with built in centre console with iPod doc\n<br> New Sun Pro dials (Rev, Oil Pressure &amp; Oil Temp)\n<br> Original clock also that has not been connected yet but power there\n<br> Leisure battery \n<br> Rock and Roll bed\n<br> Nice old cabinets in the back\n<br> \n<br> I am looking for £15,500 which is a bargain for the parts alone. If you think the body is not your thing look out for another shell, swap all the parts over and sell off old blue. Personally I think its got the making of a unique rat bus, but you may just prefer to get it tip top again.\n<br> \n<br> All the pictures were taken of the bus as it stands in my front garden today. So no cleaning of it since I last used it to go to the Goodwood festival of speed a few weekends ago. It did 450 miles that weekend without missing a beat.",
