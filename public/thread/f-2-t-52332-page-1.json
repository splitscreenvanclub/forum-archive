    "content" : "There are folks out there that seem to rubbish anything that Simon does - no idea why.\n<br>\n<br>Personally I've never had a problems with his solutions, I think they are innovative, well thought out and keenly priced - not to mention designed by an aircraft engineer.\n<br>\n<br>If I were you and had any interest in this then I would do as I did and pick up the phone - Simon is a very knowledgeable and helpful chap and at least that way you can get your questions answered by the guy who designs and builds them and not someone on an internet forum who's looked at a picture and is basing his \"assumptions\" on that alone.\n<br>\n<br>For example - he says that it's a shame the roll centre is fixed - well if he'd bother to pick up the phone then he'd know that the picture is of a prototype and the finished versions have the option to place the wishbones in four different positions - that way you can roughly set your desired ride height (about 4 inches) and then fine tune it with the shocks over another 1.5 inches - that way the geometry remains correct regardless of height.\n<br>\n<br>I don't pretend to know everything about the things that Mr Vzi seems to be an expert on but I do know that the position of the steering rack has no effect whatsoever on the Ackerman angle as that is measured from the ends of the kingpins to the centre of the rear axle - and seeing as the wheels sit in exactly the same place as they would with a stock bus then the ackerman will be the same. He also says there's no apparent castor adjustment - again a phone call would put you stright on that one as there is provison for this.\n<br>And the last bit about dirt traps - was he clutching at straws there - have you even seen the underneath of a bus? - hardley the flat, trap free underside of a formula 1 car is it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>When I spoke to Simon the other day he was saying that the one he has fitted to his bay is a revelation, not just the ride quality but also the grip and handling - I know he's bound to say things like that about his product but he's also not shy about letting anyone drive his bus to see for themselves.\n<br>\n<br>Me - I will be ordering one of these as soon as funds allow, seems like a bargain given that you'd pay Â£1000 for a rack conversion where for a few hundred more you can have that and wishbone suspension that's fully adjustable - if it's good enough for thousands of hot rodders then it's good enough for me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Orb",
