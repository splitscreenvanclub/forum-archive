I searched for ages and ages.. just to find what they are called...\n<br>\n<br>Now I have found a source and bought some...\n<br>From a long way away (hence the price.. Duty n VAT n surcharge mostly...Grrrr)\n<br>\n<br>Not too expensive.\n<br>\n<br>Answers on a reply..to this thread...\n<br>\n<br>Clue...they are quite small..\n<br>Just over 1/4\"..\n<br>\n<br>As they say.. it is the little things that matter..\n<br>\n<br>75p each....plus postage probably large letter..\n<br>\n<br>Discount available for more than one...
