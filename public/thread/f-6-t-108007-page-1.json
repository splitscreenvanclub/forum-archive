On a stock Type 4 engine, the cooling air is blown into the engine horizontally by the fan on the crankshaft and then deflected downwards through the cylinders by the tinware. It is a very efficient system and in my experience a stock Type 4 engine will run much cooler than a Type 1 engine that has been modified to achieve the same performance.

I have a set of IDF40's ready to fit when I get around to it, although it is running perfectly well with the Solex's at the moment. \n<br> \n<br> If anyone is contemplating fitting a Type4 motor, the most powerful one that VW produced was the AN series. This was fitted to the 412LS cars of the mid-70's era and was an 1800cc unit producing a reliable 85bhp in stock form. It is actually more powerful than the standard 2 litre engine found in late bays. It was an AN engine that I put in my late bay to replace the original 1600TP - it went straight in without any problems. As has been said, a bay is heavier than a Split, and my bay flew! The low down torque is particularly strong - great for hills. \n<br> \n<br> The Porsche 914 also used the Type4 engine, 1800 initially, then 2.0. Not sure if these were AN series or not. Someone who knows about 914's might be able to shed further light on the motors these cars used.",

    "content" : "The tinware for a Type4 is quite different to the normal Type1 stuff, but could no doubt be modified to suit. However, I decided to use sheet ally. You need a piece along each side, shaped around the inlet manifolds plus the large rear piece around the pulley. Jake Raby used to supply ready made sections for use with his DTM shroud (see pic) - I don't know if any of it is still available. I used some of these and added a modification to seal the crankshaft pulley area (frequently just left as a slot) to avoid heat rising up from the exhaust system. I think I may still have some templates for the main sections somewhere deep in the garage.\n<br> \n<br> I used a Vintage Speed exhaust, fitted in the same position as the stock muffler for a Type1 motor, ie. fully inside the rear valance. This requires the stock heat exchangers to be shortened (CSP can supply these but they're expensive) and an air supply to be made available to push the heated air up front. The air has to come either from an electric fan (as generally fitted to the 2L buses) or via outlets on the shroud. (Note: a DTM shroud does not have any outlets). I decided not to fit heat exchangers and got some stainless header pipes made up to position the muffler where I wanted it. Similar very good headers (equal length) are available from Vintage Speed.\n<br> \n<br> I've attached a few pics to illustrate the above - hope these will help.\n<br> \n<br> Dave.\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33140&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33140&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"DTM tinware sections\" title=\"iPhoto.app.jpg (152.7 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n    DTM tinware sections\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33142&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33142&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1295.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1295.jpg (284.56 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33143&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33143&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1780.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1780.jpg (279.6 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33144&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33144&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1794.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1794.jpg (324.88 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33145&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33145&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1927.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1927.jpg (287.42 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33146&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33146&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bab35b8ea2ca97e86105739ab0fec19d\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_6789.jpg\" title=\"IMG_6789.jpg (248.29 KiB) Viewed 2029 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
