If in doubt delete the entry in the settings and log in through safari again. \n<br>\n<br>You could also try a different browser app like chrome and see if that works?\n<br>\n<br>You could also use the tapatalk app on your iPad which is free and would allow you to upload photos easily as well. \n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps.",
