All seems o be logical with exception of the section that sits between the dogleg and B pillar, do I need to remove and replace the dog leg or is there a technique to remove the long panel without the need to butcher the dogleg?\n<br> \n<br> A links to your build threads would be helpful.\n<br> \n<br> Regards\n<br> \n<br> Paul",
