    "content" : "I bought the box off pye1man (Andy) on VZI in 2007. He told me the following:\n<br> \n<br> 'Not completely refurbished but has new bush and seals fitted. As far as I Know through my research even as new you could expect about an inch play at the steering wheel. You can adjust a certain amount out, but generally most wear is in the bushes, of which this steering box has had them replaced. Box came from Wagen west in the States along with some dropped spindles..., took a long time to get here so in that time i rebuilt my existing one with new bushes and seals, which made it a totally diffenet box! When this one got here i decided rebuild that one too just in case and whilst I had the the seals,bushes and reamer in hand'\n<br> \n<br> The box never went in my van so can't really comment on how much play there is.\n<br> \n<br> I'll have to look at postage but can't imagine it will be cheap.",
