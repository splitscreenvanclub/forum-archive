I had been looking for a Celette or Car O Liner chassis jig for ages but couldnt find one so made one, and had a few brackets cut out which were welded up. We used my 61 split to build the jig and brackets as my chassis is nice and original / straight. Here is the finished jig / brackets, and with the replacement chassis trial fitted to the jig:\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/y5zlrcl91btoxu8/Photo%2021-12-2018%2C%2010%2009%2005.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4r7jcjdn9jbrsie/Photo%2021-12-2018%2C%2010%2009%2047.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zz87yuwi5gw1rp4/Photo%2021-12-2018%2C%2010%2029%2031.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/m52cmwcevwf1w1j/Photo%2021-12-2018%2C%2010%2029%2048.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6fasfqi694u9q6m/Photo%2021-12-2018%2C%2011%2042%2005.jpg?dl=0\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Fitted the cab doors to check the gaps were all good before anything was braced or cut out.

I sanded and mopped a few areas and helped detail it before the show:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890295.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890292.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Now Volksworlds all over, its back to real work. We got a bit more done on the chassis... Loads of hours but not a lot to show for it, enjoying it though. \n<br> \n<br> We got the rear donor chassis / torsion housing section trimmed down and tidied up. We got the new chassis rails square and lined up the rear cut before tacking everything in place. Then got the sills, I beams etc mocked up and once happy panel pinned in place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890266.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Once we were happy everything was in the right place we seamed the join in the chassis rails up where the factory join is. Bit gutted, was hoping these would come out perfect as they wont be ground flush. They are not bad, but not my best welding:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890265.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br> Spot welded the sills to the I beams and top hats. The complete floor support framework finished but not welded to the chassis just yet:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890267.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> We got the front and rear outriggers and cross members pinned in place, once happy we took them apart and spot welded the rear cross member to the inner sections of the chassis rails before they were fitted:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890252.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then we spot welded the rear outriggers to the chassis before the rear crossmember 'assembly' was welded in place. We painted epoxy and weld in all the box sections, and weld through primer on all the spot welded sections before anything was welded for maximum protection. \n<br> \n<br> After the outriggers were welded, we spot welded the 'cross member assembly' in place trying to make it look as factory as possible. \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890253.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890257.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Seaming up the torsion housings:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890254.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890255.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Repaired the rotten lower sections of the beam mounting plates. Now ready to fit to the new chassis rails:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890258.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890259.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The other side needed the threaded tube welding back in place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890260.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Outer section on the other side repaired too:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890261.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> They were a slightly different profile along the top edge compared to the new chassis rails, after a bit of messing about they fit nice:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890263.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890275.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Started spot welding the inner front chassis sections in as factory:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1890262.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Thats it for now, back in it tomorrow \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
