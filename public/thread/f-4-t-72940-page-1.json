    "content" : "So is anybody interested in a rather special (already proven &amp; well known) BWA 2.4 type 4 motor?\n<br>\n<br>Best of the best by Ahnendorp BAS (\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ahnendorp.com\">http://www.ahnendorp.com</a>\n<!-- m -->), turnkey, Porsche Cooling, twin 44 webbers, special stainless BAS 4 into 1 merged header, it has separate risers to prevent the head studs pulling under warm up (like a Porsche) it’s has a totally merged system with springed collector, all stainless etc. sounds great, lots of goodies, just had a full strip down, clean &amp; reassemble so now all ready to go again. \n<br>\n<br>Although it ran a 15.4 without trying too hard, it really isnt an out and out drag motor, more a superb smooth torque monster on the street and motorways \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Only raced officially 6 runs (Not by me \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> ), then street use… mileage approx 10,000 not enough to carbon up the piston tops, if thats any indication? \n<br>\n<br>Bargain at \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">£6k</span>",
