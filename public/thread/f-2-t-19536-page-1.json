    "content" : "I just read an interesting statement made on the samba that the UK barndoor seem it getting of the ground finally. I thought this happened in 1996 when 4 barndoors were displayed at Volksworld. This was my introduction to the barndoor. 3 years later I owned one myself, this was Jan 1999.\n<br> \n<br> Recently I bought some old ssvc mags from ebay. These date back to July / August 1987. On the first page is a reference made by Steve Mellor relating to his 54 barndoor which I believe he found in scrap yard. On the 2nd page is a barndoor ambulance OYS 127 though at the time people we more impressed it was an ambulance!\n<br> \n<br> In the next mag Sept/Oct 1987 there is a barndoor for sale\n<br> \n<br> 1954 barndoor camper for sale, Ideal for restoration, comes with it's original engine, gearbox, door handles, speedo, 16\" wheels etc. One of the first RHD models in the country £350 \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> May / June 1988 Steve Mellor is selling a 54 panel\n<br> \n<br> 1954 Split screen 'barndoor' panel van.

They all seemed to have cool reg numbers too, which were definately worth more than the £250 - £500 asking prices for bus and registration!",

However clearly the guys writing about their buses new their stuff.\n<br> \n<br> I can remember volksworld using barndoor as the side loading doors.

This has become a matter of priority for me as things are changing which means my Westy and SC could be for sale......looking like I can only keep one so it will most likely be the BD, though I will have huge regrets selling any of them. Plans have changed on the BD, to be able to get it on the road in time it will remain stock height etc......for now anyway!",
