She has been garaged at all times and regularly sails through the MOT as I do minimal miles in her. The paint has faded giving it a very nice patina.\n<br>\n<br>Currently running a 1600cc twinport motor with the rear converted to straight axle using a 1300cc bug box and T2D adjustable springplates. \n<br>\n<br>New 4\" narrowed CB Beam with Gabriel air shocks plumbed in up front with onboard compressor giving approx 3-4\" of upwards travel. \n<br>\n<br>New tyres all round: 165/50 fronts and 185/65 rears on 4.5\" and 5.5\" porsche chromies. \n<br>\n<br>Both front and back brakes have been fully overhauled with all new parts and new brake lines fitted throughout with dual master cylinder upgrade. Braided lines used at the front.\n<br>\n<br>I have the original beam and box which will go with the bus if required as all parts used in lowering it are bolt on items\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1424/1393109371_e1ef64cfd9_m.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1301/1394002758_280b4696a1_m.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1432/1393109009_1c30c86d23_m.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Â£16995",
