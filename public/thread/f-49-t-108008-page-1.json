Friend is a retired carpenter and am going to take the splitty over to him in a few weeks to set him to work but would make his life a hell of a lot easier if there were any measurements or templates for interiors people had already drafted...? Mines a 67 walkthrough and was a microbus/kombi so I want to redo it with a forward facing bench seat, 2 rear facing seats and a table which can be dropped down to bridge the gap and form a bed.\n<br>\n<br>Not a major issue if not as I may get him to draw up the plans when he makes mine, just a lot more time and effort for someone who is doing me a favour! May even get him to make up 2 or 3 to sell on at a low price as everyone seems to charge a lot for them!",
