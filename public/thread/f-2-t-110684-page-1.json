It's VERY rare to see a stock engine these days, inevitably they'll have aftermarket dissy, coil, plug leads etc etc mainly as og parts are no longer available or are beyond servicing. Even the best 'stock' engines will often be missing bits of tinware or thermostats which will affect their reliability.\n<br>\n<br>My 2276 in the beetle has proven to be the most reliable motor I own but that was built by John Maher and serviced by Terry's so I'd expect that to be the case. \n<br>\n<br>I'd say stock or modified makes no difference it's all down to doing things properly.",

Using a Haynes manual or Idiots guide and keeping things standard is the best way to keep your Vw reliable for the average diy mechanic (like me). Modified motors - especially when you don't know who has done what - is a minefield. My vans motor is a nice 1641 on 34 ict's but I'll swap it back for the og 1500 when I finish rebuilding it as I'll know exactly what's inside it. I wouldn't attempt the 2276 with electronic ignition, twin carbs, external fans etc.",
