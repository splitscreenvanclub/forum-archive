John is totally correct, the aircleaner is comlpete and is correct for a 36hp motor. If it has a wingnut on the bottom (I cant see if it does in the pic) it`s a 55 to 56 type and if it doesn`t then its the 57-59 type. The change to the cliped type ones came in with the early 40hp \"b4stard\" motors.\n<br>\n<br>Scotty is also right - if your deluxe was not ordered with the 6 pop out package then those \"medium\" catches are correct for the two rearward windows.\n<br>\n<br>The pull handles - These are only correct for the late 66 and 67 model buses with the \"flipper\" type interior door handles. They were not fitted or produced in 59. However although they are not correct for your bus they will still fit if you want to use them to aid shuting the doors - as I have seen done many times before on early buses \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

As said the airfilter (if it has no wingnut underneath which would make it a 55-57 version) would be correct for a 59 36hp motor, but not for a 59 40hp motor - which would have had the clipped type previously mentioned.\n<br>\n<br>If the bus was produced in late 59 then it would have more likely come with a b4stard 40hp - (that is what the early short production run 40hp motors are known as. They didn`t make them for long before changing the design to the later and more sucessful 40hp motors, but your bus definitely would not have had one of those later 40hp`s)\n<br>\n<br>It`s a great bus, I look forward to watching its restoration \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",
