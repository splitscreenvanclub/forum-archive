Same as Jim we go to several euro shows and always book the bus on as a low car never had any issues. Roughly £50 each way normally. \n<br>\n<br>I've been looking at the spa dates and the return journey is working out at £115 return. \n<br>\n<br>Once your in Calais I think it's 219 miles to spa. So it's a fair trek but the show is worth it, and the road trip is half the fun, fit a CB and you can still chat to other people in the group if there's a few of you?\n<br>\n<br>Gary",

You can relax on the ferry it's a 2 hr crossing\n<br>Chunnel is 30 mins\n<br>We have got there on the Thursday and the Friday although Friday gets very busy very quickly\n<br>It's about 3.5 hrs from Calais or Dunkirk to spa if you don't mess about, it's a fantastic show we'll run, very few rules and people are very well behaved, the Europeans really know how to do shows, none of this over the top health and safety cobblers.\n<br>The track parade on Saturday is one of the best things you will do apart from being allowed to run yout vehicle around the track at what ever pace you like earlier on in the day.\n<br>All the guys are very welcoming and the parties and music goes on well into the night so if you like quiet maybe stay in a campsite just on the outskirts of the circuit, there are toilets and showers down in the main camping area the showers cost a couple of euros.\n<br>Fantastic event 10/10 can't wait till August myself.
