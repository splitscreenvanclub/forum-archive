    "content" : "Hi\n<br>\n<br>Could I please take advice on an issue following an MOT failure?\n<br>\n<br>I have an intermittent issue with the headlights on my bus. I have a two position dash mounted dimmable headlight switch. My van is 12v ( I believe from standard ). If I pull the dashboard switch fully into the second position, I am sometimes unable to get dipped beam. When this occurs, only the sidelights are illuminated. At this point I also cannot get full beam to stay on ( full beam works if I keep the steering column stalk pulled as if I am flashing the lights ). If I continue to pull the stalk until such time that main beam stays on, I am then able to get dipped beam successfully from this position again by pulling the steering column lever normally\n<br>\n<br>I am wondering if it is likely to be a sticking relay rather than a faulty switch?\n<br>\n<br>I would appreciate any thoughts as I am a novice at anything electrical!\n<br>\n<br>Kind Regards \n<br>Paul",
