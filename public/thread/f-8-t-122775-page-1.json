    "content" : "Limebug do bolt on kits, if you’re definitely going air ride then their 4” narrowed jawbreaker saves a lots of hassle and work. The rear doesn’t require any mods to the car but if you don’t mind chopping and welding then look at the airkweld kits and fabricate it yourself obviously you can’t go back to standard though. Demon motorsports do hydraulic kits that look the nuts but they are in the USA so shipping may be steep(one of the barndoor builds on here uses this system). Depending how low you want to drive it you maybe better doing an irs conversion and bolting bags to the arms and dogleg them for an extra 2.5” (this is my route on my air ride 70) straight axels don’t like driving too low for too long as it buggers up the bearings but you could do a transmission raise to get a safe couple of inches extra(easy to do, just use a bus nose cone and modified trans cradle to suit). You can get quite low on the rear using red 9 dogleg plates/spline drop and coilovers then match the front that is static but you can still get a nice looking stance. Keep up the great work and remember pics or it didn’t happen.\n<br> Mick.",
