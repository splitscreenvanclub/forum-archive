I phoned an order through last week for some bits and the person on the phone had no clue to what part I was asking to buy! Good luck with getting any communication about shocks through to them and good luck with them actually bothering to process your order. \n<br> I'd go outside the vw scene and source some, much cheaper most of the time.",
