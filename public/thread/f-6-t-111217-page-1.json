    "content" : "Hi all, I hope you can help...\n<br> \n<br> Last night I was driving home (about 10 miles) all was running perfectly, but then I stopped at some traffic lights and after a minute or so of idling the engine just stopped. I tried to turn it over, but the dash lights wouldn't even come on!\n<br> \n<br> I drive a 67 split screen camper and I know the ignition runs through the headlight switch which was replaced when this happened before, but now everything seems fine with that. the only slightly odd thing that was going on is that one headlight seemed really dim and the middle warning light on the speedo was very slighty glowing.\n<br> \n<br> Any thoughts as to where to start would be much appreciated!\n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> Carl",
