I want to keep it. It's going to get a fill rebuild and hopefully a few trick bits to aid performance/cruising speeds. I know it's never going to be fast as such just a slight increase would be sweet.\n<br> \n<br> Im coupling it up to an irs set up and as it'll be fully rebuilt will be running sweet. Anyone have any suggestions as to the best performance mods? Cams, rockers etc??\n<br> \n<br> And what works well with eachother.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Thanks a lot \n<br> \n<br> Joe",

I know there great little engines and supposedly the most reliable which is what I want. As long as it's capable of cruising at around 60/65 with the irs set up I'll just rebuild it standard as that's all I want to be fair.\n<br> \n<br> Joe",
