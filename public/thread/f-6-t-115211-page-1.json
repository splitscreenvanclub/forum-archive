Is it possible to take a normal split and retrofit a dormobile roof into it? Or is it frowned upon? If ok to do and if I can't source the parts second hand, does the dormobile site offer all the parts needed for a new clean retrofit install? Apols if these are daft questions, and a forwards thanks for any advice, cheers",

    "content" : "To buy all the parts required from Dormobile is £2500-ish and for them to fit it all is about another £2000-ish. I forgot to,ask if that was plus or including vat becuSe I was still picking myself up off the floor \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">\n<br>I've looked into a company called \"pop-top roofs\" and they do a straight up lifting roof and also what looks the same as a Dormy roof but without the fitted windows, instead it just has the pressings. Also the canvas is a slightly different shape, being slightly more angled as it goes up rather than having a gentle curve (hope that makes sense). They do theirs for about £2600+vat fitted. I am currently looking at the possibility of having one fitted by a motor home specialist who will do it slightly cheaper. The roof design appears to be for a bay and is then re-profiled to fit a split but I have a sneaky feeling that the Dormobile ones are the same. Speaking to the motorhomes guy he said that they never fit exactly right regardless and always need a bit taking off here and there to get everything fitting correctly and the profile matching the roof so it fits tight. \n<br>I will let you know how I get on (or don't if it turns into a complete balls up \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> )\n<br>Only issue with the Dormy roof is that you can only just get a 2 bow rack on the front and can't have a rack on the back so I'm going to have to think of something to carry my surfboards, but I'm working on it \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

I've done some measurements using a horrible old transit commercial roof bar and it looks like I can make up something like you have and the boards \"should\" reach over the top of a Dormy and have enough overhang to allow me to strap them down. I might look at butchering what I have to make it look more like yours as the one you have is most definitely better looking than the crappy old pile of junk I have.
