I've got 2 weeks to fix this.\n<br> \n<br> Where do I start ?\n<br> \n<br> I was thinking points and then a compression test.\n<br> \n<br> Jason",

Oil level, points condition and gap, spark plugs, clean and check condition and gap. Fan belt tension while you're in there. \n<br> I believe running hot is a sign of the timing being out. If that doesn't solve it put on here which carb(s) and dizzy you have and see what other suggestions you get",

Except one.\n<br> \n<br> Clearance should be 0.15 and all bare 1 of them were 0.15 - .0.2(just)\n<br> The one that was out was quite a way out. I worked my way through the feelers gauges but when I got to 0.3 and it was still quite slack I didn't bother checking and more gauges.\n<br> \n<br> It was on the number 3 piston and the second one working from front of van to back, which I believe would make that an inlet.\n<br> \n<br> The oil on this side of the engine seemed a bit dirtier that the other side.\n<br> \n<br> I'm going to change the oil. \n<br> \n<br> So if this is the cause of the over heat could someone please explain how it happens. Everyday being a school day and all that.\n<br> \n<br> Much appreciate the pointers and help so far guys and also the engine sounds a whole lot sweeter. Much less clatter !\n<br> \n<br> Oh and I took her for an mot this morning and she passed. Nothing to do with engine over heating I know.
