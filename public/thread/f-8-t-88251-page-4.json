Lost time and pushed the budget sky high. I didn't want to compromise on quality so we had everything handmade and customised. All credit to Dave and Matt for keeping going. \n<br> Beautiful interior by Ken's Customs. \n<br> \n<br> Can't wait to get her on the road.\n<br> \n<br> I visited the site again to get some of the original pictures so thought as there had been interest I'd post an update.",
