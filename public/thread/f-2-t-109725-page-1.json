    "content" : "Hi all, I have a ribbed mango 58, when I bought it it had a repaint in the states years ago, but it looked good in the pics. Turns out its a mango on the bottom half and God knows on the top.\n<br>\n<br>Curiosity had gotten the better of me as to what the original paint was like underneath, so on the rear off side I picked a bit of paint off with a blade, and the mango looked not too bad underneath, it got me thinking that I would undertake a \"scrape the repaint off\" mend and blend anything that needed it.\n<br>\n<br>now I'm quite a way into taking the red paint off and at the point of no return!! I've only done 70% of the belt line down so far. Most of the red paint has been really difficult to take off, I've tried all sorts to assist with the removal..........\n<br>Just a blade\n<br>Oven cleaner and blade\n<br>Wire wool and oven cleaner\n<br>Low quality paint stripper and a blade\n<br>A DA\n<br>And nitromors green and a blade with wire wool. \n<br>\n<br>The repaint has proved to be rock hard, prepped very well and not your typical US repaint. There is quite a few bite marks from the blade too. And as for the roof, well that's solid and something I am dreading!! It seems just as solid as OG paint and nitromors did nothing on the small flat patch I tried. \n<br>\n<br>Thing is, I'm now thinking its might have too much to mend and blend and I may as well blow the whole lot over, well, the belt line down for now, in mango, and maybe age the new paint to suit the van.\n<br>\n<br>If I go down this route it would be done by me on my drive with my gun. I'm certainly not after a shiny van by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd like to know other people's opinion. What would you do in this situation, mend and blend? Carry on scraping? Blow it over in new mango and age it? Or something else completely?\n<br>\n<br>Here is a few snaps of what I mean. Let me know your thoughts guys. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/04/13/d119579d5aa5b9f096ab0c731db86f85.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/04/13/7ef53f87cd7d7569784e4a0268cf417f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/04/13/e74511374a77b6315d912c689b16646f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

It also acts as a sort of sponge to carry more fresh thinners back onto the panel. You will experience some run off, but it serves to soften the paint you want to remove below it as you move down in strips.\n<br>\n<br>A wipe with successive pieces of blue tissue roll until the surface is pretty clear of smears and that's how it looks in the third image above.\n<br>\n<br>I also hit the front panel near side with some compound and a machine polishing mop just to see what it came out like and you can see the result below the screen with just a two minute go at it.\n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps.\n<br>\n<br>Nik.",
