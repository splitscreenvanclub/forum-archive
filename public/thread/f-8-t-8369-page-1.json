    "content" : "My pride and joy! A very battered looking untouched Australian Kombi. Been into VW's since I was a teenager, but this is my first Split, and my first attempt at any sort of restoration. Slowly cleaning up all the underside at the mo, which isn't too bad. Giving it a coat of POR15 as I go. Engine was running, so just going to give it a good service. Getting most of the bits for the motor from BFY in the states, don't know how good they are but had trouble finding reasonably priced stuff over here. Just trying to clean all the running gear up right now, don't know how well anything works because I've not had it on the road yet!\n<br>Going to try and keep it stock as possible, as I don't like lowered buses. I love the old 30hp motor as well, if it can do 55mph OK it can stay! Also love the original paintwork, but the other half want's it respayed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> (same colour though, maybe next year. Getting a coat of Anker Wax for now.)\n<br>Once I've got it on the road going to copy an early Devon for it, with the help of a cabinet maker mate and a '59 Devon interior to copy. Aiming to have it running by the Brighton Breeze this year.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/roof.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Splittrailor.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Splittrailor2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Splitnewhome.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/wilfdrivingseat.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Enginebay.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/restofloor.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
