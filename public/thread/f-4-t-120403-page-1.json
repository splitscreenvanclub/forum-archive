    "content" : "I have for sale various long spoon catches in varying condition...\n<br> \n<br> I should add they are fully functioning, no missing springs or snapped clasps. \n<br> \n<br> Also ignore the numbers on the white piece of paper in the pics. The correct photos are with each description. \n<br> \n<br> All available to post anywhere at cost or can take to the DTA meet next weekend. \n<br> \n<br> Numbered here so i can describe condition in pairs as best i can\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4488/36911837744_eaa8e93f64_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> no. 1 \n<br> \n<br> these are the only repro pair here. fitted to my last bus have very light surface scratches but as you would expect from nearly new in great condition. \n<br> \n<br> Heritage sell these for £70 each £80 the Pair plus postage or collection from Birmingham.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4461/36911716124_00ff99b711_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4450/36911714884_4579b4dc9f_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> no. 2\n<br> \n<br> These were NOS when i bought them but have been used now. They are in similar condition to the repro ones above, would look right at home in a restored bus. Id like £180 for these plus postage\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4485/36911711084_0f066010c3_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4469/36951521873_25c7430c35_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> No.3 \n<br> \n<br> Another pair of originals, this time a little more surface pitting and scratching than the previous set. Still look presentable but probably suit a OG bus more than restored one. \n<br> \n<br> £140 plus postage the pair\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4468/36951520973_936ac0ed1e_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4465/37363622970_bfb94a5e3d_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4469/36951521363_e60e21e357_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> No.4\n<br> \n<br> The worst condition pair depending how you look at it, slightly worse than the previous pair, pitting to the chrome and surface scratches.\n<br> \n<br> £130 plus postage the pair\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4489/37589876692_e7806ed3f4_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4485/23769337338_43210e2272_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4505/23769336158_e42401d039_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> N0.5\n<br> \n<br> singular and most heavily pitted latch, surface rust and heavy pitting £50 plus postage\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4467/23769334148_eb9fb76bc7_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4457/23769334938_4438fe3ecb_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4468/37363617790_c62af2d852_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Lastly i also have a original late bus short latch\n<br> \n<br> nice fully working condition but has surface pitting and rust £20 plus postage\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4458/37363614590_9d56862338_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4446/23769332118_3cb39664ec_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4459/36911688444_2d2441299b_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
