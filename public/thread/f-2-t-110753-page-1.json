I asked about the paperwork that I needed to include &amp; was told they don't ask for proof of duty or insurance anymore!!! \n<br>I think I'll call again tomorrow.\n<br>Anyone registered a van recently??? \n<br>\n<br>Cheers",

    "content" : "Had major rows with them recently after they rejected my application twice. Ended up calling HMRC, PTU and NCH Car Team numerous times....... all of which couldn't understand why DVLA had rejected my applications cause as far as they could see everything was correct. Eventually turned out that the DVLA's system was showing completely different information to all the other Government based companies I mentioned above. SO I sent them a stinking letter on my third attempt of registering it and also said I'd like to make a Formal Complaint....... got a phone call today to say that my application has now been processed and I should receive my new log book within a few days.\n<br>\n<br>I sent: -\n<br>\n<br>V55\n<br>NOVA\n<br>Photocopy of my card driving licence\n<br>Photocopy of my Paper driving licence\n<br>Photocopy of my insurance cover note (not sure they need this, but sent it anyway)\n<br>My MOT Certificate\n<br>Original Brazillian Log book\n<br>Stinking Letter\n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps....... it's taken me nearly two months in total.\n<br>\n<br>Good luck!\n<br>\n<br>Chris",
