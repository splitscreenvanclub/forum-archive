    "content" : "Hi Sean, \n<br>\n<br>Some of this has probably been said before, but here are my thoughts on your questions.\n<br>\n<br>Pic3 - This looks to be made from a cut down bulkhead cupboard rather than the walk-through cupboard/seat tops . The walk-through cupboard might have had two smaller sliders enabling them to be opened. Mine are 18\" long if that helps, and the centre of the cupboard is not accessible (dividers added) due to the room being taken up by the spare wheel bulge.\n<br>\n<br>Pic4 - Buddy seat that sits behind the driver. The cut-out by the radiator is for the spare wheel bulge in the bulkhead panel. You would need to make a mirror image of the top to fit a LHD bus. You would need to remove the top, flip it over and re-attach in a mirror image configuration. The edge that sits against the outside of the bus has no side so you would also need to swap the panel from the left to the right hand side. The panel slopes in towards the bottom. I've not measured it, but mine looks similar on both sides so you should be able to swap side piece quite easily.\n<br>\n<br>Pic5 - This seat doesn't appear to come from a Torvette? Not sure what it is but looks to sit on LHS of bus again with cutout for the spare wheel bulge in bulkhead. You might be able to use this in place of the seat in pic4.\n<br>\n<br>Pic7 - This is the removable buddy seat. It's symmetrical so should work in either configuration. There's a sharp pin mounted, facing upwards, on the right hand edge of the fixed seat behind the driver that the edge of the removable seat sits on to help it stay in place.\n<br>\n<br>pic-8 - Cushion sizes:\n<br>\n<br> Buddy seat cushions, all four, are 24\"x18\"x4\"\n<br> Rear seat base 45\"x18\"x4\"\n<br> Rear seat back 49\"x18\"x4\"\n<br> Luggage area cushions two at 24\"x18\"x4\" and one the same size but with a 15\"x5\" cutout.",

Graeme and I have had this conversation before, in another thread, with a couple of interesting points being made. We noticed in the photo in the 66 brochure you mention, that the rear cargo door table is actually wider than the door itself. Could this form part of the seat/bed layout that maybe serves a dual purpose, what do you guy's think? With it being wider, it would have to be removed when door is closed? The stay looks like a solid rod as well?\n<br>\n<br>I posted some of our conversation (pg3) below from this thread ...... \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=58843\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=58843</a>\n<br>\n<br>Is there any chance you recognise this 'table' TractionMan?\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>barndoorz wrote:</cite>Thanks type21f\n  <br>\n  <br>The little brackets look like them, the little table however looks different in the brochure for the Torvette Standard, a couple of things, the brochure table looks wider than the cargo door and it doesn't appear to have the alloy moulding around the edge. \n  <br>\n  <br>It actually looks like it has an alloy stepped section that maybe doubles up as a piece to fill in for the bed maybe. \n  <br>\n  <br>Type21f, if you enlarge this page of the brochure you emailed me you can see it clearer. \n  <br>\n  <br>This is going to be fun trying to work it all out!!\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <img src=\"http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b107/devonman/Bulkheadfulllenghtslider.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n </div>\n</blockquote>[/quote]",
