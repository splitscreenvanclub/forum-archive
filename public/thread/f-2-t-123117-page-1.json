    "content" : "Hi all not been able to do much to my 66 Brazilian split for a while hence not been on here for a while. \n<br> \n<br> Iâ€™m currently doing the brakes on it, had a disc conversion installed. Iâ€™ve changed the master cylinder for a duel circuit and changed the brake pipes, all have been bled through and no air in the system as far as I can see. The brake pedal still travels to the floor. The bus wonâ€™t move when the brakes are applied and I try driving it forward but im not happy that there is nothing until the floor.\n<br> \n<br> Iâ€™m toying with retro fitting a brake booster with a vacum pump but I donâ€™t know really to be honest.\n<br> \n<br> My Karmann brakes are the same system and behave as Iâ€™d expect and that is a 68.\n<br> \n<br> Before I go spending a bucket full Iâ€™d appreciate any advice.\n<br> \n<br> Do I need to bleed more or is this how bus brakes work? Not had one before so Iâ€™m scratching my head really. \n<br> \n<br> Appreciate any advice or tips\n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Iain",

It keeps pressure on the system using a spare wheel/tyre so allows you to locate any leaks also. Just remember to follow the instructions and deflate the tyre to 20psi IIRC as to not put too much pressure through the system. Start with the offside rear, then nearside rear, offside front and finally nearside front. Good luck!",
