It's only a small motor &amp; the bigger gears may cause issues in the future without improving the drain back to sump. Just sayin... It's also worth checking the alignment of the oil pump inlet with the case hole, they can be a bit hit &amp; miss. Did you plug the pump outlet in the case, I may have missed it?\n<br>As you've also found out, the oil hole alignment on all the bearings/case will need checking &amp; also the fit &amp; finish of the relief/cooler plunger holes too...\n<br>\n<br>Good work buddy \n<br>\n<br>CB",

I'll have to sucked the and see if think as I can't really afford a 26mm atm . I'll check the oil hole alignment as well thanks for the tip. the case has been cut and plugged to fit the external oil pipework too (thought I'd posted that too but must have missed it) cheers matt",
