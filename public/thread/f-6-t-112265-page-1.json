    "content" : "WHS ^^^^ Brembo are fine. You often find that new shoes squeal before they bed in to the curve of the drum. You can sort this by holding them up to the drum and then sanding them to fit exactly to the drum curve. Wear a mask though - they don't have asbestos these days but who knows what the replacemnet stuff is like in the lungs?",
