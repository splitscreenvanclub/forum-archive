It was loverly, orange, stripy bumpers with all the German town council logos on. I checked back on their site a few weeks ago and they were still trying to move it and the sticker price had dropped to £6000. \n<br> \n<br> The main reason I didn't buy it myself was that it wouldn't fit in the garage - but I now keep the crewcab in a barn so it wouldn't have mattered. Doh.\n<br> \n<br> Even the missus thought the cherry picker was a neat idea?!? I could've done with it the other week when I was fitting a chimney liner.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\">",
