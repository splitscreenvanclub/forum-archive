It's a good tip and I've used it a few times now.

I wasn't happy with how the lower part of the dogleg sat in relation with the sill…… it seemed to kick out a little,\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1871_zpscbfmcfgx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1871_zpscbfmcfgx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>but if I just bent it, then it would kink so I made up a little tool to \"tweak\" the return - not wanting to use mole grips as the inside is all painted and finished. By tweaking the return I could bash the dog leg in a bit without it buckling\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1872_zpsyjogve0w.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1872_zpsyjogve0w.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>This was it all after the \"first pass\" of filler \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1873_zpsobqqngb1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1873_zpsobqqngb1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>but I knew that Gary wouldn't pass it so re-slavered it ( is that a word) at the same time letting it run over to the \"B\" post and it's all starting to look rather good \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I'm getting the hang of this now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1874_zpsplvmx1po.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1874_zpsplvmx1po.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I let the filler run out along the sill so that I could lose the difference - the sill is pretty much perfect and doesn't need filling - but the alignment needs a little bit. Whether I coat the whole sill or not depends on how it looks, or what Gary decides \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> but I figured that I could lose the difference in a few inches or so, but if I need to take some filler all the way along it's no big deal as I LOVE blocking……. not \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1876_zpst1ww8jwx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1876_zpst1ww8jwx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I even made myself a medium sized block out of some MDF \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1877_zpse11lmko1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1877_zpse11lmko1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Next I moved back to the n/s rear panel. I'd got this panel looking fairly good a while ago, but when I attempted to do the rear upper corner, I'd cut into it and stuffed it up again, So I re-slavered it, this time with Topstop Gold and did it again. It's now looking good in the spirit wipe, although difficult to photograph as it's constantly drying up\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1878_zpsgorlhcdy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1878_zpsgorlhcdy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I've been instructed to cover it up with Duct tape next time to prevent me \"scuffing it up\" - I think that's what he said \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> so that's another tip I've learnt and duly passed on.\n<br>\n<br>I've been doing other little bits with left over filler, but the bigger panels are fast approaching. I keep thinking of what MarkP said earlier in this thread that soon, \"nearly ready for paint\" would become \"ready for paint\" and I can see what he's getting at………..but there's a helluva lot more blocking to do before then \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> :\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG1879_zpsm3y3elqs.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG1879_zpsm3y3elqs.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I had an email from Paul at Harry Harpics today which went thus…..\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">One question: do you have a breather box fitted to the vehicle, or are you planning to get one?
