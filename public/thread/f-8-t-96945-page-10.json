I had the 700 quid floor kicking round the garage for almost a year now, so it is nice to finally get it installed. The reason for the delay is that I wanted to ditch the heater log and get both heat exchangers giving heat to the front. So I needed another curved tube from the y piece. It's far too difficult to make, but after much searching, vw Jim came up with the goods, so big thanks for that Jim.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>I'm afraid I didn't take any pictures of the first side goin in, but here it is installed minus the welds around the side panel supports, it's etch primes underneath and the I beams and top hats coated with weld thru primer where they join the floor..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/99e419526f938536e97d0f250409a6aa.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/758d389443a4b6cdb267357262f5ff3a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/83619a9988b430f90238cec3e66192f2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And the other side marked out ready for drilling\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/2d9ea8a8b700c7c0261a18e9dbb81c01.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So hopefully next week ill have the other side in then the joining panel with the rear shelf, that schofield also make and I have ready to go in.\n<br>\n<br>Hve a good Monday folks\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Jon",

Joe is going to do all the prep work in my garage, as and when, as of course there is still welding to do, but anyway, today was his first day..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/892102cf527ad8a755e8ade444d2d755.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>He started with the front, and it's unbelievable to watch someone do this kind of work...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/dbb6afec1a3670e55b7b8c290ec3fbd2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Yes he has dreadlocks, but aplenty doesn't like bob marley.....\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/33b59a116634bad5a99ebb9a171acc43.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/0b567b0c90ba73d0ac53bb9c26f25736.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/276952da643dceba870bb0436f4ca53c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/520c76d21e2c32df4ae999055327ecaa.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/3cda592bd64235ef5a7f062a8493d6d3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So after 7 hrs work on the front it's ready for 2k primer!!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/77e958f8dc5445edfaeb7f4dcd507db9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>He's back again tomorrow and most weekends until its ready for paint or until he catches up with me, I still have some stuff to do, including a dent, pushed in bit at the back, but more about that later...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Is that a big enough update for you Steve?? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>More pics tomorrow of bodywork progress!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Jon",
