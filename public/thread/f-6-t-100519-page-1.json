Can't see double sided tape will work in any way, its not a light modern trim that fords have. When I've seen buses painted they'd already been pre drilled for trim, but lets face it, the screws would take off the paint wouldn't they?! I don't recall any bus with rust lines from screws in deluxe trim so put grease around all drill holes as protection and don't worry is my advice",

The issues are not insurmountable but in most cases the trim need \"tweaking\" to fit the bus properly and the reason you can usually get it to fit is because all the screws pull the trim into shape along the sides and profiles of the van - glue just won't be strong enough for this I reckon.\n<br>\n<br>Plus - I don't think I've ever seen a bus with repro trim that you couldn't tell straight away that its repro trim - the contours just don't seem right to me and it always looks too shiny.\n<br>\n<br>Orb",

I anneal Devon edging before I fit it around tables etc - makes the trim very pliable and easy to fit with screws. \n<br>It's pretty easy with aluminium alloys - just heat it up (not to melting point!) and quench with water. There's an old trick where you smear soap onto the surface before heating - when the soap goes black it is at the right temp for quenching. Anyone tried this with deluxe trim?",
