The new high standard for engine oils (set in the US by the American Petroleum Institute - API) has made multi-grade oils suitable for use in the VW engine.<br> <br> The main issue with using a Mono-grade Oil of 30 weight, is the fact that at starting temperatures, the oil is too viscous to move freely around the oil galleries of the engine and this lack of protection on starting causes premature component wear and therefore, higher maintenance costs and time.<br> With a multi-grade oils, such as 10w30, 10w40 AND 15w40, the engine is more effectively lubricated from cold start and therefore gives much better protection of the internal components.<br> <br> What is ZDDP and Why is it important to my VW Air-cooled Engine?<br> <br> ZDDP (Zinc DiakylDithioPhosphates), or Zinc for short, is the Lubrication additive that has been proven to protect the internal components of an engine from wear. Many lubrication manufacturers refuse to publish the ppm (parts per million) rate within their oils, as they are far too low to have any effect. We do publish our rates and they range from 1200ppm for our standard oil, to a massive 1600ppm in our performance 10w40 Semi-synthetic.<br> When should I change my oil?<br> <br> HALSO Lubricants recommend that you change you oil in your VW Air-cooled engine every 3,000 miles, or under, to keep your engine and components in optimum condition.</span></em>\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
