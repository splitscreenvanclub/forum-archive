    "content" : "not done a round one, did a centre oval one. gently prized the edge up. did not have to go all the way round ,as you can slide the glass out one end. used a thin 2mm thick kitchen mirror, glass cutter to rough size. then finish off the final shape with a belt sander, a bit at a time. the glass will get too hot and splinter if you go to quick. once it is the correct shape slide back in and gently rub the lip back over with a flat blade screwdriver, a bit at a time, as it is aluminium you can smooth it round nicely. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",

    "content" : "I've done it. Think it was 2mm glass that I used. The local glass shop cut it for me.\n<br>\n<br>The original gasket in the mirror wouldn't fit afterward, but I just folded it up and stuck it in the void behind the mirror.\n<br>\n<br>You won't get a perfect result, but it's good enough. I warmed the mirror with a chef's blow torch (it's the only one we had) and wrapped the end of a screwdriver in masking tape and ran it round and round and round the lip to raise it a little, then used a plastic chop stick to raise it the rest of the way until I could get the new glass in. Kept using the blow torch to warm the metal and keep it supple.\n<br>\n<br>Did the reverse to press the lip back down to fit it.\n<br>\n<br>I pushed a few dents out at the same time, with a piece of wood wraped in masking tape. Just heated the mirror bucket, laid it on a folded tea towel, and rubbed the dents in toward their middle. Worked OK.\n<br>\n<br>I'll try to post some pics of the results tonight.",
