    "content" : "Andy, \n<br> I just had this predicament, my lump is a 1600TP, so the option for twin carbs was there, just didn't want to spend another Â£461 than I needed to just yet, but after the mechanics spent a while trying to get that old lumpy carb working right, after several hours cleaning bell stripped and cleaned, to which it needed a full strip and rebuild, costing up time and labour, against going a route I would anyway....\n<br> So I bought some twin carbs from eurocarb, with the best CSP twinning kit, delivered next day, fitted, working, looking great, and no doubt performance improved.\n<br> Think it was the right option for me.",

So I bought a new one. To be honest, it just didn't feel as good a quality etc but having said that. I dropped it on, started it up and it ran just fine \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> .\n<br> \n<br> It does need a bit of fine tuning but probably at a level that i can't do so I reckon i'll get the bus on the road, then take it along to a rolling road place and let them set it up properly.\n<br> \n<br> And then....in time get the original solex refurbed.\n<br> \n<br> Andy",
