    "content" : "Hi \n<br>Does anyone have a \"dead\" 6v Eascolyte Invertor (for an Easco interior fluorescent light) they wish to sell?\n<br>These were 6v and I want one to run on 12v. Many were destroyed by reverse polarity or applying 12v.\n<br>The light unit and shade was just a mount for the tube.\n<br>These separate boxes were mounted inside the rear overhead table mount on Devon Conversions with a switch in a hole on the front face.\n<br>On Martin Walter Dormobile Conversions they were just screwed to the interior panel between the windows as in this picture. I have no idea where the switch was fitted!\n<br>I will be fitting the original Devonette over engine shelf but I do not have a cupboard that side or a rear over head mounted table. The Devon Caravette had the invertor mounted inside the void created above the side support pieces for the rear table. I will be refitting a hanging cupboard on the NS so the overhead table support will not work with that ...\n<br>\n<br>I want an OG box to transplant 12v internals into.\n<br>\n<br>Alternatively\n<br>If you have one and do not wish to sell it..\n<br>I would love a scanned copy of the wording on the top of the box...So I could make a scaned copy in red to stick onto a self made box..\n<br>I will probably mount it on the window panel behind the curtain as in this picture but not sure...The Devonette has a side seat and it would need to be mounted up high to avoid bashing your head if sat facing across the van.\n<br>A 62 Dormobile had forward facing seats.(Jury still out on this...I may mount it on the OS upper surface of the rear shelf with a Moortown esque curved trim added each side of the shelf. ...so it is out of the way and I have somewhere to fit the switch)\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/easco%20lyte/4579032.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/easco%20lyte/4579032.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>On closer examination...This picture came from thesamba.com where a member has also been running an advert asking for the lamp and invertor BUT I have just realised where this is fitted.\n<br>The picture maybe shows a Dormobile Canada installation with the invertor mounted up high on the OS B post? I certainly shows the step in the panel and the pressing indent with the box against the top edge of the fixed side window.......",

Or a push in out switch. ..\n<br>I have a Lucas chrome toggle switch to use (off eBay)\n<br>I was going to make a flying spur type bracket to come up from the top side of the cant rail going upward to sit behind the headlining. \n<br>Shorter than the body of the lamp which can be bent into postion so the lamp base can fit onto it without pulling the headlining. The lamp looks to fit just above the rail so a simple long strip coming just above half way up and just longer than the distance between the screw holes mounted on the edge of the cant rail would suffice. \n<br>I made similar to mount the interior light over my Devon cooker in Peebles.\n<br>This worked well...",
