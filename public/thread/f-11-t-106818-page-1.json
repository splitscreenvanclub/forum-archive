The main implication of this is that any forum notifications that go to Microsoft hosted addresses will be blocked until the situation is resolved. At this point in time I've got no idea exactly how long this will take to sort, but it is in hand, and I'll keep you all updated on our progress. \n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Nige.",
