    "content" : "Been a while since I updated my progress, so here goes!\n<br> \n<br> What have I done......?\n<br> \n<br> Upgraded to dual circuit brakes and while I was at it changed all the hard and soft brake lines (even thought they were pretty good anyway). That now means that the brakes have been completely re-newed. Should keep me stopping for a good few years.\n<br> \n<br> Fitted a nice Gene Berg shifter that my lovely girlfriend bought me for my birthday! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2686084375_ec11398762.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Thought I'd better replace all the gear shift bushes and couplers to get the most out of it. Was a bit of a job but not as bad as it could've been.\n<br> \n<br> I also had a bit of a tidy up with all the leisure wiring (I just chucked it together to make sure everything was working and then just left it!) \n<br> Bought a better power inverter and hooked up a 240v double socket on my TV cabinet. Also bought a PS2 (can't beat retro gaming!!) off ebay, so thats all hooked up now.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/2686901194_5e2e089d8c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> A few months ago I bought an original reverse light off thesamba.com. I'd had a hole in my original rear bumper where a light had been mounted and the reverse light switch on the back of my speedo so thought I should get one. Ended up getting a mint original one for less than a repro so mustn't grumble! \n<br> Got it wired up and it works a treat.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3148/2686082241_26c532d571.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Next on the list was a day awning. I'd seen a couple around and seen BVK's plans on his website so I enlisted the help of my mum and we rustled this up.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3196/2686899218_2492143618.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/2686899834_89522a6ec7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2686900082_ba84f6c30e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> Needs a bit of a clean and an iron but I'm really chuffed with it. Used it in some pretty heavy wind yesterday and it worked a treat \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br> \n<br> As a nice little bonus, my bus is in this months Camper and Commercial. I'm really pleased about it and it was great to meet David Eccles, he's a top bloke and is doing a great job with the mag \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_salut.gif\" width=\"23\" height=\"18\" alt=\":salute:\" title=\"salute\"> \n<br> \n<br> I'll be at the Dubdayz Summer Festival next weekend so if anyone is going and you see me, pop over and say hello.\n<br> \n<br> Jimi",

We’ve also converted a barn on my parents farm that took a good 5 years of my life! \n<br> I now use the bus for wedding hire that, although not ideal for most owners, has meant that she well and truly earns her keep and has guaranteed her place in our family. If it wasn’t for the weddings I think I would’ve had to sell her to help fund the barn when we ran out of money in typical Grand Designs style!",
