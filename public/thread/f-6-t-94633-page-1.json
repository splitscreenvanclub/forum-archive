    "content" : "I think I must of been really lucky as I had the bus up on a ramp and me and a mate both novices pulled it all through in 20mins. There really are only a few wires fuse board to the rear. Use a wire coat hanger or welding rod if you have one to tape the heads of the wires to ands then feed it through. Have some silicone spray to hand ( WD40 will do) in case it gets stuck and then one pull and one feed it in. I started in the engine bay and worked my way forward. Personally id feed a couple extra wires through for future use. If its a US bus a separate indicator light, possible a temp sender or rev counter. All this done now will make it so much easier in the future. I also ran the power for the radio and interior lights direct from the leisure battery so they will never drain my main battery.",
