    "content" : "I am looking to sell my 1967 panel. I got it off of the last owner who had the bus for almost 40 years. It was last on the road back in 1992 till I got it last year. It does need a little rust repair (both rockers, 2 jack points, and a small patch near the rear tail light). I have Gerson metal for the rockers and jack point. I have replaced all the brake line (hard and soft), and the shoes and hardware in the brakes. I need to do the last bleed on the brakes again as they feel stiff. The bus runs great with no issues. The interior is still the same since the owner did it back in the 70's with some brown tufted vinyl. The front seats are covered in their factory covers but they are town (covered with a seat cover usually). I have shipped many vehicles overseas usually to a buddy in Germany. Here is a link to the stuff I have already sold:\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=112050&amp;p=845452#p845452\">viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=112050&amp;p=845452#p845452</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br> These are all of my shipped and sold vehicles (except the 1954 green Beetle that is still for sale!!).
