There should be one on the NS upper luggage panel just in front of the rear cupboard and this is where your mirror sits most of the time. My local hardware shop did have some almost identical ones Snail brand I think... I did buy the OG stock and sent them out at cost to forum posters.

    "content" : "Hi Richard,\n<br>\n<br>Well after closer investigation, and some measuring of the side mirror location I have found out something I had suspected before.\n<br>The reason my mirror doesn't fit at all well above the cooker is that my side cupboard on that side is not a Devon made cupboard, or at least parts of it are not.\n<br>Its 2\" longer for a start, the Original side cupboard on the drivers side is 25\" long, my other homemade side is 27\" long which impinges on the location of the mirror mount.\n<br>\n<br>The cupboard is a very good replica, and parts of it are probably Devon, I wonder if it broke or split or similar and a PO remade it?\n<br>(and I'm pretty sure you could specify how many cupboards you had installed from the factory - so wonder If I only had one from new. Type21f will confirm this I'm sure)\n<br>But looking carefully the construction of the end plate is different.\n<br>\n<br>But anyhow.... I have measured you the screw locations in the trim which are original, and match the OG mirror bracket holes - the mirror bracket had been moved to the other side of the bus when I bought it.\n<br>I just put screws in the trim holes to tidy it up when I bought the bus, as I couldn't refit the mirror there due to lack of space because of the 'too long' cupboard.\n<br>\n<br>So here goes - hope it helps....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsf903e310.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsf903e310.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps4b318cc4.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps4b318cc4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
