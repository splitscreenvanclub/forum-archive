It’s run by a lovely couple Fred &amp; Glynis, Fred as a 65 Westy and a 79 Bay and will talk all day about Volkswagens which we were doing one evening the next thing I know he’s got me rounding up the Pony’s and moving them into the next field. We went out in convoy with them one night into Perranporth for fish n chips, parked up overlooking the sea and eat them with local cider and Gin n Tonics, what a lovely couple.\n<br> They own the surrounding fields which have Pony’s Alpaca’s and Donkeys. It is a 2 minute walk to the SW coastal path, 10 minute walk down to a secret cove/beach, 20 minute walk along the coast path to St Agnes with a family friendly beach or a 40 minute walk to Perranporth with it’s 3 miles of beach.\n<br> We are having a nice break and would recommend this campsite to anyone that wants to come down to this lovely area but wants to avoid the hustle and bustle of the bigger campsites down here and only £20 per night!\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=35485&amp;sid=7d57caf986eb149f87e3271943de6acc&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=35485&amp;t=1&amp;sid=7d57caf986eb149f87e3271943de6acc\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"0353CB26-8E39-498B-A53D-F14EB84073AB.jpeg\" title=\"0353CB26-8E39-498B-A53D-F14EB84073AB.jpeg (219.56 KiB) Viewed 2671 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=35485&amp;sid=7d57caf986eb149f87e3271943de6acc&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=35485&amp;t=1&amp;sid=7d57caf986eb149f87e3271943de6acc\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"0353CB26-8E39-498B-A53D-F14EB84073AB.jpeg\" title=\"0353CB26-8E39-498B-A53D-F14EB84073AB.jpeg (219.56 KiB) Viewed 2671 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> Crosscombe Farm\n<br> St Agnes\n<br> Cornwall\n<br> TR5 0XP\n<br> 01872 552379\n<br> Mention the Split Screen Van Club when booking.\n<br> Cheers have a great holiday John.",
