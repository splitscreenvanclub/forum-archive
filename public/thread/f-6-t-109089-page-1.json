SMOOTH , POSITIVE STEERING , FULLY ADJUSTABLE SHOCKS , AND WAS EASY TO FIT \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>down side are you'll never be able to go super low again and this system is not narrow enough for your bus to go super low ...... I've had it down to 62\" to gutter and I rubber on my inner arches so I took him back up ... his now sitting at 63 1/4 I think and its a good high and only rubs a tinny bit every now and then if i have heavy passenger and hit a big bump in road .... ( wife 9 stone so it never rubs when she is shot gun ever with a fully loaded bus ) \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>If you need any more info just call buddy 07799714868 and I i can answer your questions i was \n<br>\n<br>Mark",
