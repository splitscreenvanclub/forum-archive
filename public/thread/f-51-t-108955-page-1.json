    "content" : "Not a split sorry !\n<br>\n<br> am selling my very rare 1967 built 1968 model year Volkswagen SC. Built in December 1967 and right hand drive this is ultra early and very rare.\n<br>\n<br>This model benefits from some special early features, including push button door handles, factory painted dash and long neck rear view mirror\n<br>\n<br>Originating from South Africa, it is very solid. Being a commercial vehicle it has its fair share of bumps and scrapes which only adds to the character and history. Thankfully the load bed and gates are free from the normal chequer plate and wood infill panels that happen to so many as a cheap repair.\n<br>\n<br>I believe the bus to be in original paint, although as you would expect it has been painted in some areas over the last 47 years !\n<br>\n<br>The gates, doors and floor are in great shape, I will add further photos of these and if you require pictures of anything please just ask.\n<br>\n<br>The SC is MOT'd until 26th February 2016 and of course tax exempt.\n<br>\n<br>It starts on the key and purrs along lovely. All gears engage correctly, it doesn't pop out of gear and the clutch is good.\n<br>\n<br>I have 1 original key that fits both doors, ignition and the engine lid. The treasure chest is on a separate key.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is very standard, still on original drums at original ride height.\n<br>\n<br>As per forum rules I would like Â£10k\n<br>\n<br>Please contact me via PM for more details or view on eBay here:\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/191548713938\">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/191548713938</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>Thanks,\n<br>\n<br>James",
