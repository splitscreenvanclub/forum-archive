I've already painted the engine bay and underneath in the green.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=105620&amp;start=30\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=105620&amp;start=30</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>\n<br>My question is, what colour should the inside be? It's a '59 so not sure if that would make any difference? It was originally Sealing wax red with a white roof and the dash was in red, rest of the van inside was white. I've gone L14 which was used up to 1959 (in type 1s) to keep it original(ish) but wanted it to look right from the inside.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone have any ideas what would look right?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Jon",

SWR/BG had a lomg production run. It ran for approx three years either side of the change over date, so it`s commonly found in both dash variants.\n<br>\n<br>MG/PW is more commonly found with the PW dash as the colour ran for longer after the change than before, but the Grey dash varient is not really that \"rare\" as such.\n<br>\n<br>Turkis/BW is very rare to find with the Turkis dash. This is because this colour scheme was introduced slightly over half way through the 61 model year so there was only about 5 months or so of production with the turkis dash followed with about 36 months of production with the BW dash. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",

It will be a 62 speedo pod still so top-half colour would suit it but in mango it will be wrong to not have a mango dash. \n<br>\n<br>Genuinely agonising over this.
