    "content" : "Hello,\n<br>\n<br>Like it says my gas gauge in the 65' works (as well as they do) when the headlights are off and also fine when they are on but if I turn the switch a tiny bit to illuminate the gauge/speedo lights, the gauge pegs to the full side completely. Never had this problem before. Ground issue perhaps? Anyone else had this before?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks.",
