They have an overlap which goes around the edge of the frame and you can soft iron wire them in place if you choose..\n<br>Be very carefull with the spikes, they break off and they pierce flesh very well...\n<br>\n<br>I posted a thread on replacing springs from a donor. I swapped eight out and it is very easy and rewarding but the springs also give you body piercings. If you work out which are broken and can then unwind the repcement from the donor...and then wind them back in and tag them...it is easy..\n<br>You just need patience.\n<br>\n<br>When you come to put the covers over the pads...you need to use seating wadding / upholstery padding to pad out and give the sape to the cover....just as VW did..",
