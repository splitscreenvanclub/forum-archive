For genuine (gps) 60mph French motorway cruising I always get a pretty steady 32 mpg. I don`t know what it is around town, but I guess mid to late twenties. I would say that realistically 35+mpg would only be achievable with a very light foot, bit of a tail wind and 45-50mph cruising, but with those factors it is potentially possible.\n<br> \n<br> Also I think single ports have the MPG advantage in a bus as they are inherently more torquey which really helps the momentum of pushing a brick like shape and also have a considerably smaller carb, so are have less capability of gobbling up so much fuel too \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

What i found made a massive diference was getting the fuel pressure correct for the carbs, many just slap the fule pump on and forget the pressure should be adjusted.",
