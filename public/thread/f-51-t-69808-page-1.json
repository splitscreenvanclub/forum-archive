    "content" : "Due to another van being made available, with much sadness our 11 LHD window Kombi is for sale. Plenty of work (and serious ££’s) has been carried out to what was an already solid van to get it to the van you see here. Just flew though MOT, Tax free.\n<br> Imported by Steve Gilbert (One-on-one) in 2005 from California. \n<br> Previous owner was Chris Lyons of Trimming Tonic until we bought it a couple of years ago.\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">[<strong class=\"text-strong\">b]Price: </strong></strong>[/b]\n<br> \n<br> Due amount of money spent on this van (mostly Engine running gear, body panels and extra’s like a Propex heater!!) I was looking at around £18K ono, open to serious offers but no test pilots or dreamer’s please.\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">Body:</strong>\n<br> \n<br> It left the factory in VW Light Grey and at some point in the states was painted VW Velvet Green. I was told that Steve let in a 10 mm strip into the front wheel arches to give them an earlier look. Both lower rear corners have been replaced along with both battery trays. The cargo door sill, inner, outer and the internal strengthener have been replace along with a strip where they attach to the floor. Both cargo doors have had the lower inner and out skins replaced and are now solid. The Offside wheel well panel (back of the wheel arch) was also replaced. Most of the panels were Autocraft and are an excellent fit. All was then stone chipped (where not seen), Zinc primered and painted in a Velvet green with a matting agent to match the weathered, original paint. This was then waxoiled, as with the rest of the van.\n<br> The Shell is in very good order having been ankor waxed and waxoiled in the past. The paint is weathered with age and has the odd mark here and there, a couple of small dints and the odd show of surface rust. These have been treated and satin lacquered to protect the steel. It’s not an extreme rat look, just a little used and I can live easily with that and not be afraid to park it in a car park!! The US spec bumpers have had the same lacquered treatment.\n<br> \n<br> Interior:\n<br> \n<br> Built by Trimming Tonic, Westy style cupboards over and to the side of the ¾ rock and roll bed. Large storage under the bed with a large storage area in the rearward facing seat. Inside this you will find the Propex 2000 heater (1 year old, over £400!!), controlled by the thermostat located behind the driver’s seat, a brilliant heater and seems to use very little gas to heat the van up in no time. Both benches are fitted with either Wolfsburg West lap belts or a 3 point belt. All wood is Light Ash veneer on MDF and is very sturdily constructed. The Foam is 4 inches thick and covered in a Brown/Green/Cream wool Tartan and Brown Vinyl. Lovely, soft, warm and breathable without causing you to sweat in bed!!. The whole van has been lined with a sound deadening/ insulation matt and then a 1 thick layer of King Span is fitted where possible.\n<br> \n<br> Mechanic’s:\n<br> \n<br> Recently built new (March ’10) by Steff at MAC. Type 1 2110 CB Turbo EFI easy tune with Charge cooler. Drives really strong off boost allowing easy cruising and decent economy (well for a split!!) but comes on strong when the boost comes in. Really drivable and was recently dyno’d at 170 bhp at the wheels (200+ish at the flywheel) on Awsome GTI’s roller’s. Only running a safe 9lbs of boost (Map sensor will handle up to 2 bar, 30 psi!!) but this would outrun the current usable clutch!! (Kennedy stage2). Very serious money in this engine/box and all brand new with less than 1500 miles on it.\n<br> Massive Spec as follow’s:-\n<br> \n<br> CB Super case 90.5. 8mm stud’s.\n<br> CB 82 mm crank\n<br> CB 5.5 inch H beam rods with ARP Bolts\n<br> Lightened steel flywheel 8 doweled, Chromalloy Gland nut.\n<br> Mahle 90.5 mm forged pistons.\n<br> All well balanced.\n<br> Manton push rod’s (Cut to length)\n<br> Jaycee Pushrod tubes\n<br> CB 1.4 high lift rockers\n<br> Big foot follower’s\n<br> Engel FK 7 Cam\n<br> CB CNC Round port head’s (port matched to intake manifolds)\n<br> CB breather tower with vented OG steel rocker cover’s (and fuel pump cover)\n<br> 8.3:1 Compression ratio.\n<br> CB 48mm EFI throttle bodies on port matched inlet manifolds.\n<br> 52 lbs injectors (good for around 300 HP I’m told)\n<br> Garret Hybrid T3/T4 turbo, Dei turbo blanket. (Good for over 400 HP I’m told)\n<br> Forge Motorsport Dump valve\n<br> CB easy tune ECU.\n<br> PLX wideband control unit for Lambda sensor.\n<br> CB turbo header, heat treated and Dei exhaust wrapped.\n<br> CB Magna spark electronic ignition system with coil pack and mapable advance curves linked into ECU.\n<br> Rancho Pro-street gearbox with 3.88 final drive, super diff, uprated side plates, longer 1st gear (ratios can be confirmed). Geared for 105 mph at 5000 rpm!! So cruises lovely at 65-70 mph.\n<br> Uprated clutch arm.\n<br> Gene Berg type mid mount.\n<br> Sway-away uprated driveshafts.\n<br> All straight axled.\n<br> Drop spindle’s up front on good standard beam.\n<br> CSP wide 5 disc brake conversion.\n<br> Twin circuit master cylinder.\n<br> Remote 72 row with fan oil cooler and filter.\n<br> Air-water-air (chargecooler) fitted with remote element mounted under the bus. Davis Craig water pump and remote header tank in rear.\n<br> All run’s lovely and cool.\n<br> Bespoke twin box exhaust system (nice deep tone, not drummy)\n<br> BMD pulley (Iron Cross) system.\n<br> \n<br> Extra’s:\n<br> \n<br> Flat 4 Enkei 5 rim’s (just fantastic quality) with 195/60/15 rear’s and 165/55/15 fronts. Steel spare.\n<br> KK Westy 2 and 3 bow rack’s now weathered and suit the van.\n<br> Brown church canopy (Land Rover expedition manufacture’s)\n<br> Delux Belt line trim with Green inset.\n<br> KK safety star.\n<br> DS Bus air intakes.\n<br> Autometer Boost, oil and Rev counter gauges.\n<br> VDO oil temp gauge (dipstick sensor)\n<br> Sony X-Plod head unit with iPod dock in ashtray. Remote control in back of bus.\n<br> Sony X-plod 6 x 9 speakers in rear.\n<br> Sony x- Plod 10 inch Sub with Amp in rear bench seat.\n<br> Phoenix Gold separate’s in front door’s.\n<br> Scorpion alarm with ultrasonic and microwave sensor’s.\n<br> CSP shifter (lovely).\n<br> Split charger with twin battery’s.\n<br> \n<br> The list goes on and on, a really lovely, usable bus that will easily crack the BWA time if you want and upgradable to even more power should you wish.!! \n<br> Located near Manchester.\n<br> David 07545 233265.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5026607033/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5026607033/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027218112/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027218112/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027211784/in/photostream/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N ... otostream/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027160578/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027160578/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5026539969/in/photostream/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N ... otostream/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5026550463/in/photostream/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N ... otostream/</a>\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N08/5027201462/in/photostream/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.flickr.com/photos/46726182@N ... otostream/</a>",
