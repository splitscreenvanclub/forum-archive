Longer term I'll use a replacement tray with the indent (hadn't realised the Autocraft panel will take a 12V battery too). I'm hoping there's enough solid metal around the perimeter of the existing tray that I can cut out the centre and let in a patch from the new panel, to avoid having to plug weld to the corner panel. Not sure if it's too badly distorted though.\n<br>\n<br>The durite clamp looks good enough for the short term fix.",
