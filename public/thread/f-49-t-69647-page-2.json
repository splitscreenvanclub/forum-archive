The pull out side bed is identical to the two Moortowns I know of from 63. \n<br>It is a division bus?\n<br>Even the detail of the catch on the front holding the lid open is identical to the 63 which surfaced recently. \n<br>If you can open a photobucket site and post lots of pictures?\n<br>\n<br>Typically Moortown had two badges, a transfer on the rear hatch lid and a metal plaque badge rivetted with two rivets onto the dash. Pm to pics sent.",
