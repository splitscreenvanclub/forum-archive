    "content" : "Well i went to the dvla office today to get the van registered which normally takes 2 or 3 days - they now have to send it off to swansea which can take up to 3 weeks!! Next drive is slightly on hold then!\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, yesterday i took delivery of my Rusty Lee rock and roll bed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> It looks great and i fitted it today. I also made up my rear seat belt mounts as i`ve been holding off to see where they need to be in relation to the seat.\n<br> \n<br> Looks good!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1731.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1732.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I also made up some rear seat belt mounts - the ones on the arch multitask as mounts for the rock and roll bed aswell and i fitted some underneath. Ideally, i wanted to put them in the sloping bit which backs onto the fuel tank, but to do that would mean engine out and gearbox out (!) so i settled for putting them in the lower bit above the gearbox which just reachs (when it has cushions).\n<br> \n<br> The mount above my shoulder i took a bit of inspiration from graham (type2f) and his mounts. I took the strenghtening struts from a donor panel i had for above the engine, cut them out and modified them to suit the curve of the van. This created a new 'd' post allowing me to mount a thick panel between with 'c' and 'd' post with nuts welded on the back. Pretty pleased with it actually \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> It will all be hidden behind the panelling when i get round to doing it!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1724.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1725.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1726.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1727.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1728.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/45/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1729.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
