    "content" : "Just kicking an idea around really......\n<br>I know that finding an original Canterbury Pitt table is nigh on impossible and that there are quite a few people out there who are missing the table. I could possibly get a batch made which would be the same as the original by dismantling mine and letting the joiner use it as a template. They would be topped off with the same pattern Formica as mine or as near as I could get it. Supplied either un-stained so you can match it to your interior or stained, like mine, in deep mahogany. I could also supply the piece which screws to the long side which the table clips on to. I believe I can supply it with the correct hinges and also the odd style dead bolts which attach it to the van. The sides of the legs would be curved as per the original and it would also be free-standing if required like the original. So far the only part which I can't seem to find would be the spring loaded stay which keeps the legs in the down position but I would find another type of stay to do so so the leg(s) would still stay down once in position. They would NOT come with the 4 short legs which some Pitt tables had for added support when in the bed mode as mine doesn't and has never had these but I believe they are available to buy as Devon short legs and cups if you wish to add these yourself. I am aware that the tables came in a few different lengths depending on what else you had in the van ie mine has a magazine rack which folds down and makes a portion of the bed but some didn't have this therefore their tables will be longer than mine. Given this each one would be made to the length you request.\n<br>At present I don't have an exact price but as a ball park I should think somewhere around the £220-£250 mark for each table and it will be as near as you can get to looking lie an OG table. Just gauging interest at the moment to see if it's viable.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
