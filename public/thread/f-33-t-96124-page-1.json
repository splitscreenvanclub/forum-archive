I went into my latest purchase with eyes wide open. Calling and then emailing to make sure the safaris of the correct year and style were indeed in stock before placing my order, surely nothing could go wrong???\n<br>\n<br>2 weeks later, still no parts, no contact, no apologies, oh and they decided to charge my card for more than the order too. If it wasn't bad enough that they're incompetent, they're now stealing money too.\n<br>\n<br>Rant over, but will be sure to update you with whatever pathetic response they come up with.",

You are now one of the next ones to be sent safaris. We are sorry for the delay but the polishers are struggling with the volume. They will be sent this week and I can then give you the tracking number. The extra £10 is for the courier charge explained in the the home page, kind regards Mandy\"</span>\n<br>\n<br>So firstly my name is Dean not David, great start there CE!\n<br>\n<br>Secondly \"in stock\" for CE doesn't mean that they have the product to sell, it means that they can get hold of it and then they can send it to a polisher and then just maybe they might deliver it.\n<br>\n<br>And finally you send an order confirmation with an invoice for £495 and then charge £505 and think it's fine to send an invoice not relating to what they're actually going to take in payment.\n<br>\n<br>I'm sure they get it right sometimes but what rubbish controls and policies for customer service. If they'd explained any of this at any point, or simply said it was a 3 week lead time then I wouldn't have a problem, just don't tell me something is in stock and then blame everyone else for why 3 weeks later it's not been dispatched.\n<br>\n<br>Pathetic.",
