    "content" : "I'm upgrading to dual circuit master cylinder and have a question. There are four outlets three horizontal and one angled down. Clearly one will go to the rears, one is for the switch, and there's one for each front wheel. \n<br> \n<br> The question is, does it matter which one goes where? And if so, what are the differences between them?\n<br> \n<br> I was under the impression it didn't matter and have plumbed the rears to the rear horizontal one, the switch is on the one angled down, and the fronts off the two horizontal front ones. I should have asked earlier but I want to get it right before I roll!\n<br> \n<br> Edit! I should add that it's still drums all round!",
