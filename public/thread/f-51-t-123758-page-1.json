The restoration took me 5 years to complete including repairing/replacing nearly every panel, a full respray inside and out in Audi sprint blue, doing an engine conversion to a 1.9td Aaz code engine and carrying out a bench seat conversion. \n<br> \n<br> I have taken it to a few shows and won a few show and shines with it. I love this little truck and really don't want to sell it but i now have 2 young kids and it just doesn't get used so what I really want is a splitscreen camper. \n<br> \n<br> I am fully aware of how much splitscreens are worth so i'm not expecting to get much in exchange for my caddy but i'm looking for a project. Maybe someone has a rough splitscreen that they can't see themselves ever restoring but would like a mint old vw to take to shows? \n<br> \n<br> The value of these pickups is rocketing like all classic vw's and i have an insurance agreed value on it of £10k so would be looking to get somewhere near(ish) to that. I also have some cash to put towards a splitty if someone is interested In a part ex up to around £15k in value.\n<br> \n<br> I won't waffle on any longer about it as i'm not expecting much interest but if anyone is interested in a swop/part ex/ buying it PM me or call 07725847610.
