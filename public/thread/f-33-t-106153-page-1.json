Normally a pm or a reply on thread with a \"I'll have it, paypal address pls\" normally secures the sale. If someone asks a question then a definite buy comes in after then that trumps the question. If I really want something then I'll send a pm and reply on thread pm sent. If i'm not sure of fitment then i'll just reply on thread the question and if I lose out no hard feelings.",
