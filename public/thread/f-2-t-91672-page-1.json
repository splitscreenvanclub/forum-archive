Originally I thought about re-using all the original door latches and handles.....Which all work fine....\n<br>\n<br>Problem is against the now 'new' bus they just dont look good enough, on closer inspection they have that typical pitting/pock marks that you see on old chromed pieces. It clearly would of affected the base metal in places \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" alt=\":-(\" title=\"Sad\">\n<br>\n<br>So my problem is do I look to get them re chromed which would require taking the base metal back to a smooth surface before re plating. I'm not sure it is cost effective? How close to original are modern re pro's of these parts? Who does the 'best' ones?\n<br>\n<br>Any thoughts welcome - if posted in wrong section apologies to moderator \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br>\n<br>She has her own folder on my Facebook page, 65 deluxe has her\n<br>welding work on here and MidlandPaintWerks have her on their Facebook page\n<br>\n<br>as a side question does anyone have some ratty 60/40 front seats?\n<br>I also have some new in the box CE safari's unpainted, I now want to go Stainless Steel, anyone want to swap?\n<br>\n<br>thanks for reading",
