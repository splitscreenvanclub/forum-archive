    "content" : "HI fellow SSVC members..\n<br> \n<br> I recently had a bit of an electrical issue - and witnessed a bit of a loom fire (thankfully I witnessed it) - The issue was it appears my stalk mounted dim/dip switch and indicator circuit was shorting out on something or together. - I tried to repair the burnt wires - but couldn't get my stalk mounted dim dip to work.\n<br> \n<br> Our bus is a 1966 Australian import microbus.. \n<br> \n<br> Anyway I decided to purchase one of these Wolfsburg West replacements from Alan Schofields at Slough Swap Meet, trouble trouble is no-one appears to have published a wiring diagram that match the number of cables I have. - The chaps on the stall suggested I look on the Samba or follow existing diagrams \n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"background-color:yellow\">Complete Indicator switch 8/65-67 with built in dipswitch. 8 wires as per US specification, but also works fine on european buses (please call for wiring details in this case)</span> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.alanhschofield.com/ourparts/prod_2448259-Indicator-Switch-6667-211953513F.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.alanhschofield.com/ourparts/ ... 3513F.html</a>\n<br> \n<br> The chap I bought it from on Sunday suggested I check out the Samba and \n<a href=\"http://www.type2.com\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.type2.com</a> -but I'm struggling to make a correlation to what I have one my stalk, I tried to call Schofields today and there was no answer.. \n<br> \n<br> So wondered if any of you guys had any suggestions or help to offer?",

Black with a white trace (controls front left indicator function)\n<br> 2. Black with a yellow trace (controls left rear taillight)\n<br> 3. Black with a green trace (controls front right indicator function)\n<br> 4. Black with a red trace (controls right rear taillight function)\n<br> 5. Black with a purple trace (input from brake light switch, the wire coming from your brake light switch is typically black/red)\n<br> 6. Long black (input to turn signal flasher relay.To terminal 87b if using 4-way emergency flash system. If not equipped with 4-way emergency flash system, connect to Terminal 54 of original turn signal flasher or 49a if using a replacement turn signal flasher.) \n<br> \n<br> Are these similar - and what do the thin blue and brown wires and thick brown wire do? - Presume the Black/Green/White wire must have something to do with the dim/dip circuit as well?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance for any assistance... I've sent an email to Wolfsburg West to see if they can help.... Coupled with this job I'm also considering wiring in a hazard switch that our bus didn't have when we bought it.",
