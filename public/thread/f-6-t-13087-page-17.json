Problem is I have a 72 Brazilian bus. So I have IRS already but using a universal joint set up at each end of the drive shafts. My box is knackered and one of the driveshafts is ropey. I can't get the bits to fix it so I'm gonna have to replace the whole arse end.",

It took about 4 days in total which sounds a lot but it wasn't hard I must have just drunk lots of tea. The only issue I had was getting the brackets rotated far enough to set the camber (they were hitting on the heater tubes). I found that once it was all fitted up, I put a jack under the bracket and gently jacked it round. Get everything painted and refurbed before you start and you should have no problems mate \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> .\n<br>\n<br>Also decide what you are going to do about your CV joint bolts; Washers, Loctite etc. I got a bit paranoid \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Well worth doing and the kit is very good.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Brett",
