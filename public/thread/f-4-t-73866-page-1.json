Only collected them yesterday from the powder coater, so literally brand new wheels not even had tyres fitted! Bolted one up loosely to my bus and not feeling it, so up for sale. Hub cap clips were removed before powder coating, so smooth looking outlaw style wheels. £200 ovno. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Previously listed and sold as 5.5j, my bad. The wheels are available again. They are all 4.5\" wide rims, so suit stock or lowered.</span>\n<img src=\"http://i280.photobucket.com/albums/kk196/patina68/015-3.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>All 4 look like this \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
