The sand blasting looks like a good option, but there is something strangely satisfying about doing it by hand.",

    "content" : "wilgartw that's well impressive. I am trying to decide if should follow your example or save a whole heap of time sandblasting. I guess if you do it yourself by hand you know exactly what has been done and there is no chance of the disaster mentioned in the above posts.\n<br> \n<br> Did you use nitromors as I notice you can get this stuff from Frost now:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.frost.co.uk/item_Detail.asp?productID=8631\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.frost.co.uk/item_Detail.asp?productID=8631</a>\n<br> \n<br> Also I'd be interested to know how you intend to stop it from rusting now it is stripped?\n<br> \n<br> I was quoted £600 to have my van blasted and zinc primered if that sounds too much let me know as the £300 I presume is just blasted and I've no idea if another £300 is how much it should cost for a primer to stop it rusting!!",
