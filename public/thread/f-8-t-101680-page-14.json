I'll post a pic of the gun, I did a fine coat to start with using short bursts, but once I got the hang of it you can just keep going as long as your compressor will keep up and as long as you keep the gun moving. \n<br>\n<br>I think the higher you have the pressure the smoother the finish, it says a max of 5 bar, It doesn't really run either. The smell is really bad, my garage is detached it's just got a kitchen/toilet on the back!! But my wife said she could still smell it in the house with the doors and windows closed, I even had the garage door shut, I'd pull the bus outside if your attached. It covers everything really we'll too, I was a bit disappointed will my seam sealing as I didn't think it was neat enough, but the gravitex just covers everything with a couple of coats and looks really neat\n<br>\n<br>HTH\n<br>\n<br>Rick",

That's why I asked you if I should mask it up, but once painted it looked spot on and blended everything in well.\n<br>\n<br>If I can get help with turning the bus back over today, I'm going to fit my safari's!!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers for your help\n<br>\n<br>Rick",
