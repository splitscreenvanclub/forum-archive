    "content" : "Hi people!\n<br>\n<br>Right just to apologise for the vaguenes of this for sale ad. Basically I've been mega busy this week and not had time to put any pics up. Essentially I've lost the loving feeling with the bus game at the minute, it's not that I need to sell the Westy for financial purposes, more the thought that a sabatical may do me good!\n<br>\n<br>I am honestly in two minds &amp; that's why the price would have to be right! I would like to sell the bus stock as I have a range of top notch goodies that I would like to Mothball for the next project that comes along... \n<br>I'm sure you are all aware of the prices of 'trick' stuff these days! That's why the bus would be more as it is... because basically it's worth more to me!!! I have had much more interest in this that when I sold the Samba, I reckon a nice SO23 is rarer to be honest! \n<br>\n<br>Here's a list of the stuff the bus has...\n<br>\n<br>New 1776 motor with twin ICTs,fullflow &amp; Kennedy stage 1 clutch.\n<br>Erco street weight wheels\n<br>CSP vented &amp; cross drilled disks\n<br>4\" narrowed beam\n<br>Dropped spindles\n<br>Creative rack &amp; pinion steering\n<br>Creative IRS\n<br>Rancho Pro-Street box with taller fourth\n<br>Hella rear fog &amp; reverse light\n<br>Hella grilled front fog\n<br>GENUINE harp mirror arms with o.g mirrors! \n<br>Original Blaupunkt radio\n<br>Headlight guards\n<br>O.g Ambulance fans\n<br>Gene Berg Shifter\n<br>Autocraft handbrake extension\n<br>Blaupunkt Ipod stero sstem fitted (discreet - no o.g panels cut!).\n<br>\n<br>There will probably be more as I think on!\n<br>\n<br>I would be open to serious offers with the bus as is... Obviously pics will help &amp; I'llget them up asap!!!\n<br>\n<br>Gill.",
