I shall be getting the ferry from portsmouth to Bilbao then drive to the ferry across to Morocco for a Month of surfing! \n<br>\n<br>Been working non stop on my van for a month but I'm super pleased with the outcome. Interior is done and looking sweet. I went for a little camping oven which is ace. Means proper cook ups! \n<br>\n<br>I have off road tyres that just fit onto the back for desert bush bashing and waffle boards for the times I get stuck which is bound to happen!. Want to be off the beaten track and have raised the suspension (after it was dropped with a S/A and dropped spindles) to manage with this. I even rigged up a simple shower from the water barrel on the roof to rinse off after a surf works surprisingly well!\n<br>\n<br> I'll be posting to instagram on progress under my name. @northernbigbird and hash tag #moroccointhe59 so look me up and keep fingers crossed she behaves! I've packed enough spares and tools to do the Dakar!",
