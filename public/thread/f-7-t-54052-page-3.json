I understand why she feels like this but I just think it's sad... anyway, hopefully she'll decide to keep it!!\n<br>\n<br>A great big thank you to everyone for their support and offers of help... it really did make us feel better about the whole situation even though we \"knew\" we'd never see her again!! the moral of the story is obviously be realistic but don't give up hope!!!\n<br>\n<br>Thanks again!!",

I know you're right but can't help the way she feels!!\n<br>\n<br>Out of interest to everyone with regards the crooklock; whoever stole it just bent the arm of the steering wheel down to get the pedal to wheel crook lock off, knackering my steering wheel... how easy was that... and what a useless crooklock!!\n<br>\n<br>If you've got one of these brake pedal to steering wheel style... upgrade your crooklock asap... I certainly will!!",
