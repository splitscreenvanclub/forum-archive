    "content" : "I’ve got this pedal pan which from memory is for a LHD split bus or possibly early bay? The one on my van I have painted in POR15 and I can’t see me needing this as a spare given it still looks ok after 11years!\n<br> \n<br> Top side has surface rust as you can see and underside has had under seal applied but under this is some grey/blue coloured paint. It is solid though. \n<br> \n<br> If interested drop me a PM. \n<br> \n<br> £75. I would prefer collection or possibly a meet up if not far away as I don’t have a box big enough to put it in but if you do want it couriering I’ll do my best to wrap it and courier at cost. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",
