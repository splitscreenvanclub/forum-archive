As autocraft aren't making them at the moment I have been keeping a eye out for one else where.\n<br>I had it in my mind that it was a LHS one I needed and so when a RHS NOS one turned up on thesamba mid week I did nothing about it. On the following Sunday whilst wondering about in the garage, I noticed it was actually the RHS one I needed. So ran inside a purchased the corner I needed.\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=13008&amp;sid=25cb32e29e63f99a573eda6472cae8ea&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=13008&amp;t=1&amp;sid=25cb32e29e63f99a573eda6472cae8ea\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_0136.jpg\" title=\"IMG_0136.jpg (80.69 KiB) Viewed 149 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>So now have another panel to fit!\n<br>It a later one so the rear light hole is wrong but the back of my original panel is ok so that will be no trouble to sort out.",

I decided to cut them right out and replace the I beams with Autocraft ones and the floor with the complete Klassic Fab one I got of C&amp;C at Busfest. The back top hat was only there in the middle so got an Autocraft one of those as well. \n<br>What was left of floor and rear separation panel bottom bracket\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=13205&amp;sid=25cb32e29e63f99a573eda6472cae8ea&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=13205&amp;t=1&amp;sid=25cb32e29e63f99a573eda6472cae8ea\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1392.JPG\" title=\"IMG_1392.JPG (60.28 KiB) Viewed 124 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>I measured the positions of all the I beams and top hat then cut them out and added them to the ever increasing pile of rust outside the garage.\n<br>I fitted a new gear shaft conduit and used that to line up all the new parts.
