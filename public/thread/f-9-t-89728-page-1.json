    "content" : "Found this great campsite this summer in the Périgord in the small town of Bourdeilles. It’s a large flat grassy well-maintained ]area right on the river – some places with trees for shade. Cost €3 per night. Just turn up, pick your spot and once a day a lady from the town hall comes to collect the money. There are a couple of toilets. A large clean swimming pool with hot showers right nearby -€2.50 entrance fee. You can actually walk to the town in less than 5 mins (small supermarket, baker, couple of restaurants..) Municipal tennis courts nearby &amp; canoing and kayaking. Great for cycling and it’s a good centre for visiting nearby historical towns and markets within 30 mins – 1 hr radius\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.airecampingcar.com/aire_camping_car_gps.php/1033-Bourdeilles\">http://www.airecampingcar.com/aire_camp ... ourdeilles</a>\n<!-- m -->",
