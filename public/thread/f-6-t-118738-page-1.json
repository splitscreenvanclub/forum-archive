I posted a matrix with clips, screws and trim strips.\n<br> I will repost when I have access to the site,\n<br> I believe the holes were jig drilled in the door but have never tried to fit a transplanted set of door cards yet. Maybe if the surface has been re-trimmed you may wish to re-drill. Not yet tried the retro fit exercise. YET\n<br> \n<br> G",
