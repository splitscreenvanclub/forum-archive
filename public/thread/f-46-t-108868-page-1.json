Any ideas cheers Kevin",

Just a couple other questions, would this year have had an overhead table slot? As there wasn't one with the parts we bought. Also on your photo showing the spare tyre, I can see a piece of timber with the a chrome screw to the left of the wardrobe, is that just a flat panel, or is there something else there?",

A Spaceway uses the smaller table in the bed set-up so no need for the other table. \n<br>\n<br>I think the Torvette had an overhead locker (with the same rear wardrobe and cupboard setup as the Spaceway) but I've not seen one on a Spaceway. Here's a Torvette one:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i18.photobucket.com/albums/b107/devonman/IMG_3499.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>You can see the over-centre clasp that holds the wardrobe door up is mounted further forward on the Torvette to clear the overhead locker. On your Spaceway you'll probably find that the clasp is in the middle of the wardrobe door:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v683/silly-password/Spencers%2065%20Devon/P2090272.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The panel down the side behind / beside the wardrobe you can also see on this photo and yes it is just a plain wooden panel, with a cutout that matches the one on the rear edge of the opposing cutlery locker. You can see the piece of wood is the middle one on this photo and that the cutout matches the cutlery locker to the left of it, or at least they would once installed with their tops at the same height:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/67%20Devon%20Spaceway/IMG_0988_zpsc08fcb08.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps.\n<br>\n<br>Stick up any more photos of what you've got, always nice to have a perv.",

Our bus is LHD, so the plan was to convert this, but after a year of looking, it seems sacrilege to modify this set to make it fit, as it's in pretty good condition!! Now not sure whether to use this as a template to build a new mirrored LHD version and ultimately sell this on to someone with a RHD! I need to have a look on the weekend and decide what to do!",
