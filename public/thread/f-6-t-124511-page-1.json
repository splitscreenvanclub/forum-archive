I'd happily pay a specialist if I could find one. \n<br> \n<br> Do I try open up the crack and get some resin in... Or do I take the top section off and re do the whole top part..?\n<br> \n<br> Has anyone got any experience or advise?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks \n<br> \n<br> Peter",

Is it weight supporting?\n<br> How long and deep is the crack?\n<br> \n<br> If is a small crack I would open it open with a dremmal and then fill with resin. Just make sure it's clean. \n<br> Are you near to a boat yard?

    "content" : "There are many YouTube vids on grp repair. Don't use polyester resin for this repair - use epoxy instead as it gives far better adhesion and is much better in contact with water. \n<br> \n<br> You will need to grind back the existing grp to feather the edges of the crack then use some West System resin and filler to fix it. A West System mini pack should be enough to sort it. Buy on line from eBay suppliers such as \n<a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/West-System-101-Mini-Repair-Pack-105-205-Small-Boat-Repairs-Epoxy-Resin-Hardener/283827947658?epid=929319775&amp;hash=item421576c88a:g:MGcAAOSw1r1efMjy\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/West-System- ... Sw1r1efMjy</a>\n<br> \n<br> Follow the instructions on line and you can't go far wrong. I do stuff like this all the time on my boats!\n<br> \n<br> Brian",
