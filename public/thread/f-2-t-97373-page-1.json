I used upholstery clips to secure it down each side of the cargo area. Thought it was going to be a total trauma to fit after my research but I did it on my own in an hour or so. Cost me about Â£50 with interfacing. Don't look too closely at the seams but that is inexperience for you. Happy with the result for what it cost!",
