    "content" : "1967 SO42 Westfalia bus, small project\n<br>\n<br>US import, LHD, full bulkhead bus, complete minus rear interior and interior panels.\n<br>\n<br>Good straight 11 window factory 12 volt bus, needing little work for MOT and registration.\n<br>\n<br>Pearl white original paint (recoverable with elbow grease) under two bad/thin oversprays\n<br>\n<br>Supplied with 5 original fitted Hehr louvre Windows, plus one additional matching one to replace original rear rhs fixed glass window (which is also supplied), three have fly screens and three have fly screen frames requiring mesh (I can provide stainless mesh to replace with foc)\n<br>\n<br>V good, reconditioned 1500/1600 single port engine with no end float etc, started weekly on first turn of the key.\n<br>\n<br>Front bench and drivers seat reupholstered with new pads and TMI covers (images on page two)\n<br>\n<br>It's had a complete replacement cab floor and long sill (it can be run with this, but I'd address it as its been applied over the edge of the long panel where that's been cut above it instead of joggling the joint, or butt welding it) image inside on page two\n<br>\n<br>Gutters, v good all around, two small (antenna) holes in front roof panel over cab, a few small holes around very bottom of windscreen apertures. Chassis, top hat sections &amp; I beams etc all good, needs cargo door sill replaced (quality inner &amp; outer/strengthener included), needs battery tray (off side) and work under drivers seat around outer seat runner (typical 67 issue due to moisture retained in foam backed vinyl under seat trim I assume) passenger side unaffected. Front panel is really nice and straight along with all other panels.\n<br>\n<br>I have left the wind screens out so you can see the extent of the work required.\n<br>\n<br>All brake pipes replaced and slave cylinders checked, fitted with a single circuit master cylinder. Need recommissioning.\n<br>\n<br>Original factory rims and brand new front inner and outer bearings.\n<br>\n<br>Cab doors, cargo doors, tailgate, valance and engine lid all nice, all handles and locks complete etc.\n<br>\n<br>This would be a small project for someone who wants to run it this year. Either strip back and keep original paint, or bigger strip and shiny paint, up to you.\n<br>\n<br>Title and NOVA confirmation in hand for easy registration as soon as you have MOT.\n<br>\n<br>PM me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br>\n<br>Thank you.\n<br>\n<br>Nik",

    "content" : "I've got all the original interior light lenses and the Westfalia light diffusers for the two lights on the side between the Windows.\n<br>\n<br>Hella US spec clear lense genuine headlights (genuine metal parts, rims and glass!) also included with UK correct beam units (just assemble and fit).\n<br>\n<br>The dash is really nice and uncut with factory radio blanking plate\n<br>\n<br>All the difficult bits to get like the bulkhead top trim are there\n<br>\n<br>All the louvre windows are in nice condition and open and close freely with all original unbroken glass etc\n<br>\n<br>Supplied with a set of four hub caps that match the patina of the bus\n<br>\n<br>Needs an inexpensive short sill (behind cargo door) and battery tray to go with the cargo door sill, strengthener and inner sill already with it. The other 'repair' areas only require very small patches, probably not complete panels (depending how you see it).\n<br>\n<br>Steering feels good, hand brake, gear shift, dash knobs all there.\n<br>\n<br>M plate on bulkhead, VIN chassis plate on air box and stamped chassis number in engine compartment all present, correct and untouched!\n<br>\n<br>I can deliver this to you in the mainland UK if this helps you.\n<br>\n<br>If you have plans, or ideas that include a bigger, or different engine, then happy to discuss as I can use the motor in my panel van.\n<br>\n<br>If you prefer, I can remove the single port engine and supply the bus with a turnkey NOS VW factory remanufactured twin port 1600 for you to fit, that's not been fitted or started since it was supplied in 1993, but that'll cost you another grand on top of the \"with engine\" price I'm afraid.\n<br>\n<br>Nik \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">",
