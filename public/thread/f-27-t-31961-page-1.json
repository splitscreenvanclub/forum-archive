The fuel pump died in no mans land between customs and the tunnel, so we did the last 200 miles with no fuel pump, but we got home. 600 miles from 11.30 thursday to 3am friday 2 breakdowns and 3 forward gears and next to no clutch. Not bad but I am gutted to have missed it, i have been looking forward to it since Hessish. \n<br> \n<br> That is not the end of it , We went out in the chevy hot rod on Sunday on the peak run with the Triumph sport 6 club, bottomed out the front vallence, accelerator stuck open, very scary, got away with a damaged front wheel and scraped wing, and consider ourselves very lucky, it has approx 350 bhp. To finish a bad few days a lady in a VW passat ran into the back of it at a T junction on the way home causing a lot of damage!! \n<br> \n<br> Beat that for a crap few days \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",
