    "content" : "Been busy busy well living the dream as rude not to enjoy the bus &amp; get out n use it..\n<br> \n<br> September was a very busy month and was out every weekend at either shows, chilling or driving miles.\n<br> \n<br> Having only just come back from cornwall was itching to get back and with the kids settled into college stole a long weekend and back to our special place for a road trip. Knocked off early on the Friday and hit the road at 3:30pm destination widemouth beach. A few delays as expected on a Friday afternoon, a diversion along country lanes parallel to the A361 took ages but one off the bucket list as always wanted to camp up and sleep on the beach. Arrived at 11pm a tad tired the the roar of the sea and waves rolling up the beach soon had us both sound oh..\n<br> \n<br> Sprung the front cover hoping for a perfect sea to sneak a early surf but alas well messy so coffee it was..\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/EBE9D3AA-2C02-4E3F-B2CF-C5AC0096D537.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/EBE9D3AA-2C02-4E3F-B2CF-C5AC0096D537.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/962A4486-D323-4C0D-8DA1-B0A2D4F09A19.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/962A4486-D323-4C0D-8DA1-B0A2D4F09A19.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> A few out playing but looked hard work for no reward so breakfast and hit the road destination St Ives for San and earn so browny points. We both love this place so a bit of shopping, lunch &amp; the cake shop \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br> \n<br> Later on we headed to Gwithian, surf was big but great fun &amp; made better as some seals popped up then later a large pod of dolphins played in the waves near by.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/8401C1BD-E364-40A2-AFC9-963B0EB9E7D7.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/8401C1BD-E364-40A2-AFC9-963B0EB9E7D7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/E1D60EFE-CB29-4290-810D-1D5EFDFCD9D4.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/E1D60EFE-CB29-4290-810D-1D5EFDFCD9D4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> After this headed to globe vale &amp; a surprise visit to mum who really wasn't expecting us as she was on holiday. Oops made her cry with joy &amp; a cracking end to Saturday. Sunday was chilled and meant to be relaxing but alas surf was up again so you guessed it and Gwithian again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br> \n<br> Monday and home time but not till more shopping for San, a stop off at westward ho for me as this beach was sheltered so sneaked in for a 5' clean wave knowing this was probably the last surf I would get for a while. Then the 300 mile return home but well worth it and exactly what we love to do in the bus.\n<br> \n<br> Wow that was just the first weekend wahoo on a roll now.\n<br> \n<br> Poor effort now as no pics so it didnt happen lol but......\n<br> \n<br> Next up grill n chill and roughly an hour's drive from us to the hop farm at paddock wood.\n<br> \n<br> This show has a vw theme but any thing goes really and is basically chilling and that we did.\n<br> General theme walk the show and admire the great vehicles, BBQ beer &amp; fire pit. \n<br> Saturday repeat Fridays list and make new friends.\n<br> Sunday well Sunday is a Sunday so relax then head home.\n<br> \n<br> Another week on and a local show ohsoretro for the Sunday just outside Margate. Local guy Lee organises this for local charities so hats off to him. With over a 1000 vehicles turning up and some 5000 visitors what a show.\n<br> \n<br> Next stop Brighton breeze with hollie convoying with us behind in her beetle plus several other local to us along the coast road. Disappointing as got parked up near the marina so totally out of the show but to drive 2 hours in wrong direction to join main hook road convoy does not make sence but will have to in the future I guess. Rain killed event for a few hours but sun came out in the end and after loads left we joined the party and shifted into centre of show. New camp venue was far better in my opinion, with showers and no portoloo's. Pindy's ditch was a great party game enjoyed by all either participating or spectator. Alas all over to soon and home time on the Sunday, although the splitty bounce and a hangover is not how I enjoyed the 2 hour drive home. Never again well till the next time.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> That's the partying over and missing it already but now the little jobs need doing. Engine needs to come out for new heads although done over 2000 miles since my last little hickup on holiday but do not want to risk the crack anymore.\n<br> Then it's build the interior cupboard and a few little paint stone chips to sort.\n<br> \n<br> Oh and the house jobs that have accumulated over this last 3 winters, yep decorating eeeeeek. New bathroom plus what ever she who does comes up with..\n<br> \n<br> But wow what a year since the resto near 5000 miles covered, great times, great comments &amp; good friends. Roll on 2017.\n<br> Laters..",

    "content" : "Seems an update is long overdue and a fair bit been going on.\n<br> \n<br> Engine came out over Xmas to start on top end work. After speaking with stateside tunning to sort new heads seems my deck height is to large. Didn't know history of heads /barrels etc so took the hit ordering new piston &amp; barrel set only to find it's exactly the same dimensions as what I had with deck height still being to large at 0.120\" where 0.070\" is more desirable . Heinsite should of got case skimmed when I built that but like always you find that out after it's built sealed &amp; several years down the line. At this stage didn't fancy cracking case to do this so next option was get barrels turned down, sourcing a local company and job jobbed.\n<br> With this done could now get heads ordered and dimensions finalised for correct compression ratio, but now the wait but hopefully due mid to late February.\n<br> \n<br> Next up tackle the interior, the temporary cabinet seems slightly more permanent but over the last 4 years have had many ideas of what we wanted so was just patient to be sure and now ready to tackle the wood butchery.\n<br> General plan is all timber for cabinet and door cards with a mixture of solid oak &amp; oak ply veneer to achieve the effect.\n<br> Plenty of pre planning &amp; direction of grain baring in mind there will be several curved panels and the oak ply bends easily in one direction but not another so determined orientation.\n<br> \n<br> Have been building bits for a few days but easier to have one general update so long panel card done just needs coating. \n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/E7BD0F5F-7557-409A-A00B-4F39F9C3827A.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/E7BD0F5F-7557-409A-A00B-4F39F9C3827A.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> From here I can start to measure and fix so fridge carcase done with lower section for storage, found it easier with fridge off the ground..\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/FB22E8F3-0170-49A2-9721-D2FF3BB89978.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/FB22E8F3-0170-49A2-9721-D2FF3BB89978.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> The waeco fridge works a treat just remember it need plenty of ventilation during the summer. So allowed more clearance over the top between fridge top and worktop.\n<br> \n<br> Next up centre cupboard and corner seat. Centre cupboard will be simple hinged flaps on the front and top section to be a draw one side and single hob the other with lift up lid, more obvious when I get to that bit.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/8F724CB7-746F-4E94-9EBB-407728AED2AA.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/8F724CB7-746F-4E94-9EBB-407728AED2AA.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Hob section something like this.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s262.photobucket.com/user/brenralls/media/4C7796E1-5ED2-4CC3-AB15-42AB36C89E03.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i262.photobucket.com/albums/ii119/brenralls/4C7796E1-5ED2-4CC3-AB15-42AB36C89E03.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Curved seat to house larger 4.5kg gas bottle to double up for extra gas for propex heater.

Then saturate the outside and it will go around the curve on its own, and bond it to 4mm flex-ply. \n<br> Steve",

Problem is when wetting the oak face its drying with lots of black dots almost like mold spots.\n<br> \n<br> Did solve the problem by steaming the back face, it made it even more flexible and easier to get a tight bend &amp; as no moisture touches the oak it didn't damage or stain the face. So will try this method first..\n<br> \n<br> Making my own bent ply is an option but do not have any local suppliers of timber that thin.",

We have 3 attachments kyham awning, sun canopy and a door cover. All clip into rail so allowing gutters to remain clear and if for any reason water gets through gutters do there job and you stay dry. \n<br> Figure of 8 strip use a long length over side door or if you have joints rain will drop in, got mine from lightning leisure.\n<br> \n<br> We've camped in some pretty hairy winds and been caught in storms 50mph + winds, all held fast. No damage to bus or rail, if the gutter rail clamp solution that would of ripped off easily &amp; dread to think what damage that pole would of done.\n<br> \n<br> The scary thing is drilling holes in a perfectly good roof but very happy we did, markP did exactly the same and once the rail is painted it almost gets lost in the roof. Just remember stainless steel screws and plenty of silicone under rail and screw heads..\n<br> \n<br> Later on in the resto we put similar thing under double door attached to sill for a draft skirt used a few times and does the job..",
