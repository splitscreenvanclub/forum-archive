VW made the gauge lights dimmable by turning the on/off switch knob. I thought mine were terrible until I read that and realised they were turned all the way down. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\">",

I’m pretty sure they’d sell you a resistor to add into the circuit and the appropriate LED replacement bulbs too. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

Genuine please)\n<br> I chose not to fit LED in the end as I agree with Who.me and like the fact they dim. I used to amuse myself turning them up and down sometimes.\n<br> Who.me mate It was a very Kind offer to send them to me but i wont take it up.\n<br> I did fit a LED to the blue main beam bulb as that has not worked for years so will update this thread is i get charging problems like Vw jim said could happen.\n<br> I really got my moneys worth with the blue LED as its is almost as bright as the headlamps and so i had to put a vw pin over it to stop it dazzling me",
