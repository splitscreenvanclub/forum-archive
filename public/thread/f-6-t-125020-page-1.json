I have been looking at Aircooled hut uk, and the VW engine company. Has anyone used them. Please write your reply or pm me. Thanks in advance.\n<br> Al.",

I know Aircooled Hut sometime sell 1776/1915 recon long blocks, which look like a good way to update your engine at a reasonable price..\n<br> \n<br> I had some welding work done the other week on my Safari’s at a local VW garage and we started talking engines and he said most of his come from the VW engine company. I’ve heard nothing but good stuff about them.. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

Makes for a very smooth engine. Only a few hundred miles done on it, but it pulls like a train, a really noticeable hop up from the 1776. Cost was about £3800 but built to order",
