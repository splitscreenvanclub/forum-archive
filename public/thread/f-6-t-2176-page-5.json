The forward momentum with you hips fixed is what causes the problems because they fix your lower half to the seat, but leave your spine un-restrained. \n<br> \n<br>Sorry, but I've worked as a physiotherapy technician for 5 years, and qualify as a physiotherapist in July and thought I'd pass on what I've learnt. \n<br> \n<br>flip \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>p.s. currently I haven't got any seatbelts at all in my van, so I'm not really one to talk, but when I am not a student, I'll definatley be fitting three point belts to my bus! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",

Luckily today I was in the open, as the beam was dropped out already, but was stripping it down for a mate, and when I knocked off the second spindle, one of the trailing arms flipped over 90 degrees when it was released. \n<br> \n<br>Now that thing really had some force behind it, and fortunately, the spindle / brake assemble came off the one under tension so it was just the arm that moved, rather than throwing the whole assemble across the workshop.

    "content" : "I've been doing some little jobs on our bus this week while I wait for the engine/wiring/tank and shocks to arrive... \n<br> \n<br>My main worry all along has been how to get a decent 3 point belt in the back for my 4 yr old son who will have to sit next to the devon cooker. Initially I was going to bolt thebelt a bit further back on the lower luggage compartment panel but the geometry wasn't good. So I basically moved the belt reel around the rear (I've already bolted the buckle where I want it) and found that the best place was going to be just next to your left shoulder about a foot above the engine bay. On a late Devon this is where the flip top rear locker is and the gap in the door is just large enough for the belt to slip through. So I've drew out a pattern and had a local machine shop knock a chunky bracket out of 3mm plate (i.e. thicker than the mechanism of the belt itself). \n<br> \n<br>It appears to work well. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P4280134.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P4280135.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P4280136.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>I also had a chat with Paul Venners about roll cages. A very eye opening conversation to say the least... I'm going to try and get the bus down to him in July for a cage around the cab, the only issues is that the B pillar cage section will run straight through my new Devon wardrobe. Also this isn't a cheap thing to do but then again how expesive are a new pair of legs...",
