    "content" : "Afternoon all, I'm new to the forum so greetings to all. I'm looking for some advice from the off so hope you can help. \n<br> \n<br> Having restored an early bay over a 2yr period, only to lose it to an engine fire last year, I'm now looking to replace it with a split. I've looked at a few but one last Monday has caught my eye. \n<br> \n<br> It has a fresh MOT but has been patched in several places underneath. A few pics of the worst areas follow but I'd like to know what those in the know think? There are a few that have been tacked on rather than seam welded (those that are seam welded are new repairs due to advisory notes from the MOT tester). Some of them appear simple to put right but there are a couple that I'm unsure of? General opinions and comments welcome.\n<br> \n<br> Offside front wheelarch:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Offsidefrontwheelarch.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Offside front crossmember\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Offsidefrontcrossmember.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Offside front chassis rail\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Offsidefrontchassisrail.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Offside cab floor\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Offsidecabfloor.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> nearside rear crossmember\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Nearsiderearcrossmember.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> nearside front wheelarch\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Nearsidefrontwheelarch.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> nearside front inner valance\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Nearsidefrontinnervalance.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> nearside front cross member\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h148/pbinns/Nearsidefrontcrossmember.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Thanks.",

    "content" : "Thanks for the replies people. I am indeed looking at it with a view to buying. The MOT was done by the seller locally to him in Cambridge, I'm based on the south coast so taking it for another test isn't really an option unfortunately. Waxoyl covering patches always makes me suspicious but he hasn't done the whole van? Having prodded and poked and with a magnet on the repairs all seems to be solid? The chassis rail is my main concern too, as it looks awkward to get to for any further repairs? Anybody else had to repair this section before and know what is involved?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for the welcome and advice. Look forward to joining you in the ranks of splitscreen ownership!",
