    "content" : "I believe this to be a post-Wolfsburg big spring rear seat from a 56-57 bus. I may be wrong with the exact years so please feel free to correct me here as it may be useful for any potential buyer! Anyway, whatever year it is from, it would look great in any split and who's gonna actually lie on the floor of your bus to check the spring sizes!!\n<br>\n<br>I'm offering it for sale on behalf of a good friend. The frames are in good condition, and the covers / piping are actually pretty good for a seat of its age. Ideal for an original bus, perhaps an OG paint patina ride? One horrible repair on the front edge but actually covering a much smaller hole which should be fairly straightforward to repair. I imagine a blind man could make it look a lot better in about ten minutes \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Use it as it is in your early bus, change the middle leg &amp; tabs to make a Barndoor copy, use it to make a front seat, stick it in your office &amp; have the coolest chillout chair around! Whatever you use it for, they ain't getting any cheaper so grab it now while you can!\n<br>\n<br>Reduced to £400\n<br>\n<br>Located at DT9, Somerset, but may well be able to bring to a show or assist with delivery.\n<br>\n<br>I'm on 07742 408558. If you're interested then give me a shout as I have a bunch more photos I can send you.
