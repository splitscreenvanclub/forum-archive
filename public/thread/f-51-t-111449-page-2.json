I didnt know that at the time and was working 7 days a week just to pay the mortgage and keep the job, Compulsory overtime they called it but thats another story. A bank loan bought my SA import and obviously I wished I had done things different but I took the seller at his word. Be interesting to see if anyone goes to evaluate this bus in the flesh and see what they actually make of it. Those pics alone show me that bus is twisted from a very very hard life,",

In other cases you will just be chucking good money after bad and in the end wish you had done things differently. I dont want to come across like a troll or look like the splitty sales police but this one just took me right back and buyers should be aware a recent paint job can hide worse than you could imagine if your new to these old buses and not clued up on the lives some of these buses have lived in developing parts of the globe where make do and mend has been the order of the day for decades.
