No worries. It can happen to all of us, you'd understand I hope. Because of all the ppl you have had more money trusted with me at a point in time than anyone else. \n<br>\n<br>You dont run away after collecting ppl's money, producing the goods, offering them for sighting for the buyers, its common sense. Because If the intent was to steal, why invest in producing orders which were never intended to be delivered? Why not just eat up the money? \n<br>\n<br>Again, sorry for the delays and thanks to everyone who wrote for heads up, unfortunately I wasn't able to read those PMs any earlier than day before yesterday as I was totally caught up in life outside SSVC etc.\n<br>\n<br>I know I would loose business over this but have had there been way, I would have avoided it.\n<br>\n<br>I would keep on doing special items on requests when ppl would reach me as I already produced a few bits on requests such as pulley wrenches kits, SO23 net hooks, hubcaps, trailer spare brackets etc. to orders of a single request from fellow members who provided me with originals to replicate from. And all this not because I saw it was profitable but because I knew I could help. Have had I been after profits, I wouldn't be doing bits with lowest demand for a niche market to start with.",

Some people are so impatient to get their bespoke part that they don't even need to make their bus run. I could go on for days about the people that made me wait for my top-of-the-line, custom parts and installation on my bus. It took way longer than 6 weeks. But my patience has paid off and now I have one of the nicest busses around. Reezvaan is a top man and deserves a break. There is life outside this hobby. What if he was in the hospital or had a death in the family? Then all you haters would really feel like crap. Or maybe your 25 quid part is more important to you than what may be happening in someone elses life.",

    "content" : "Thanks Chris, G. &amp; Joey.\n<br>\n<br>I am working on delivery delays, in fact I am facing one again from last week shipment but this time I resoluted to fix it and will be nipping the evil in the bud to make sure that the delivery times are cut short to a maximum of 5 days, from Pakistan to UK, for smaller as well as larger shipments. \n<br>\n<br>I just dispatched a 48KGs shipment yesterday from here through this new channel which looks promising as its traveling with a promising pace. When this works out, I could be able to deliver items with a maximum of 7 days to customer doorsteps in UK/Europe originating directly from Pakistan which I think is pretty much bearable for international shipments. However I also have stacked up few routine bits that I do in Reading to ensure timely delivery.\n<br>\n<br>There are few more bits in pipeline (in development phase) and I am sure by the time those bits become available to order, we'll be well rid off the delivery delays.",
