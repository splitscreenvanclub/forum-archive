alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Genuine 6j &amp;7j 16 Fuchs. €450 \n<br>\n<br>\n<br> The wheels need a ReFurb alright.\n<br>I'm gonna take the petals back to Polished look with innerspring black. \n<br> That won't cost me anything. \n<br>Only time.\n<br>\n<br>Tackled my hubs calipers and discs fitting today. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/85ebfdc7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>From the picture above. \n<br>\n<br>On the right is the 944 n/a Hub removed off its own spindle and separated from its disc. \n<br>\n<br>On the bottom left is the inner and outer bearing from the 944 hub. \n<br>\n<br>Middle left are the bearing spacers from Lanner's Kit (vdubengineering)\n<br>\n<br>And Top left are the inner and outer Bearing Races from the 944 hub. \n<br>(The smaller race I pushed out easy enough myself. \n<br>For The bigger races I gave the two hubs to a local machine shop and asked them to pull them out.)\n<br>\n<br>The other black circular part nearest the hub is the Grease Seal that Lanner provides.\n<br>\n<br>Then I assembled the hub again so to speak. \n<br>I put in The bearing spacers in first each side. \n<br>Then pressed in the Bearing Races over the spacers. \n<br>Finally placed in the well greased bearings. \n<br>And then pushed in the grease seal to sit flush with the edge of the hub. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/4667f03d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So with the disc cleaned up a bit. \n<br>I bolted the disc and hub back together. \n<br>And set about stripping the Splitty Drums off the front beam to reveal\n<br>It's spindles. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/8f7b4811.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Then I bolted up the Caliper Carrier/Bracket from Lanner's kit. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/4b2df008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>CamPhone died then so it was time for the tea while the phone charged.\n<br>\n<br>I couldn't wait for the phone after I had the Tea gulped. \n<br>So finished that side in the meantime. \n<br>\n<br>By that time the phone had charged\n<br>So\n<br>I went and did the same as above for the right hand side of the bus. \n<br>\n<br>Here is the early Porsche 944 non turbo assembly all bolted together with Lanner's kit on the front of my Splitty. \n<br>\n<br>Opposite side to the previous pictures,\n<br>Just to avoid confusion. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/e6b20284.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And here is one of the Fuchs bolted to the new Bus front brake setup. \n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/cool.gif\" alt=\":cool:\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/915c6432.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The Fuchs will look like this when I'm finished. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/33692067.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Polished Petals. \n<br>Old Skool.\n<br>\n<br>Next Installment is the Master Cylinder and Servo attempt Extravaganza. \n<br>Along with fitting brake lines. \n<br>Never ever done brakes before. \n<br>So it could be interesting.\n<br>\n<br>after some sterling discussion with 'Kai' and '13 Window' from vwkd.co.uk\n<br>It was elected that I go for a Direct Action Servo rather than a Remote Servo.\n<br>seeing as though I now have two.\n<br>MadMick's 944 ATE Servo\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i960.photobucket.com/albums/ae82/bbhf-racing/1978%20VW%20WESTFALIA%20SVX/26042011632.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>and the 944 GIRLING one I bought as a bundle off the Porsche 944 Breaker.\n<br>\n<br>So..\n<br>No use trying to fit my Servo to the drivers side of the splitty beam.\n<br>It has to go on the other side,\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/0893b53c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>(Note to self)\n<br>This servo might be leaking, maybe some fluid escaped after it was no doubt laid up after being removed from the 944.\n<br>\n<br>Hence some sort of rotating linkage was needed to push the servo rod in even though it was mounted on the opposite side to the brake pedal...\n<br>\n<br> So, I fabbed one up from a \n<br>1992 Ford Escort Van that was scrapped on my uncles farm.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.imcdb.org/i035373.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So after Ripping the Servo Linkage and indeed Servo from the Previously Rat Infested Van.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/fb68e1ca.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>I moved the two linkage eyes to suit my brake pedal lever and servo push rod.\n<br>Tipex marks the spots.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/6ae90ac5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/ea14a929.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The two rotating linkage eyes being cleaned up here prior to rewelding on to the servo bar.\n<br>\n<br>And YES I would've been quicker just making the above linkage from scratch myself,\n<br>Ah well..\n<br> you live and learn..\n<br>\n<br>Anyway I have this tacked into place and its moving the pushrod of the servo somewhat.\n<br>Hard to tell effectiveness,, \n<br>without Vacum hooked up and Brake lines fitted,\n<br>\n<br>I'll put pics of servo and new linkage for same, soon...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So. \n<br>Took her outside in the sunshine to take her for a spin around the farmyard. \n<br>Sitting waaay to high at the back. \n<br>As a result. The driveshafts are reaching too far and straining the cv joints. \n<br>I'll probably raise the spring and shock mounts and refit the standard T25 shocks and springs or BMW 3 Series Rear Springs (heard this is an option for lowering a T25)\n<br>\n<br>Anyway. \n<br>I've a feeling my steering box is foooked as its a bit dodge in the steering dept. \n<br>\n<br>Anyway here's a pic and a video. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/8155ada5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Click to play\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/?action=view&amp;current=dcc88af4.mp4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/th_dcc88af4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>So no brakes yet. \n<br>Note to self. \n<br>Get the finger out.",
