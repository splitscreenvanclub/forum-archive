    "content" : "I'm able to supply these fresh air vent replacement cover plates in Carbon fibre or glass fibre. (photos of \"wind Jammers\" a few posts down)\n<br>\n<br>I have deleted the swage line as it's not necessary with the fibre version, which allows a larger surface to be used for fitting instrumentation or switches etc.\n<br>To me the benefits are, not having to drill your original steel one, meaning that you can return it to stock at any time, as well as having any configuration of gauges up to 8 in total, not to mention the racing look of the genuine carbon fibre, and the weight saving \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> , but also it's paint-able to match your buses colour.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Carbon fibre\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/Bin-Jammin/032-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/Bin-Jammin/031-4.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Fibre glass one shown here with 8 x 2 1/16\" (52.4mm) gauges installed to show how it looks with the maximum number fitted.\n<br>If you have a hipo turbo motor this could be really useful for Boost, twin cylinder head temps, oil temp, oil pressure, Volts, Amps, clock, economy gauges etc.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i67.photobucket.com/albums/h299/Bin-Jammin/024-4.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Fixing holes pre drilled, and gauge holes can be drilled if necessary.\n<br>\n<br>Will also be making the mold to produce one for single and double din stereo fitments, (in progress) which means you can also have a combination of single din stereo head unit and up to 4 gauges, or a double din stereo, photos soon.\n<br>\n<br>So anyone can be a proper \"bus pilot\" now \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>All can be painted, so you can match your paint work, or polished &amp; can do a number of gel coat colours for the fibre glass ones.\n<br>\n<br>All the carbon fibre is done using crystal clear UV stable resin, so it doesn't go all yellow.\n<br>\n<br>Also doing \"Wind Jammers\" in carbon or fibre glass, and alternator mounting plate and backing in carbon.\n<br>\n<br>**EDIT prices added**\n<br>Fresh air box cover:\n<br>\n<br>£25 Glass fibre\n<br>£40 Carbon fibre\n<br>\n<br>Wind Jammers per pair:\n<br>\n<br>£10 Glass fibre\n<br>£20 Carbon fibre\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>Ben.",
