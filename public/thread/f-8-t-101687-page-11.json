Its all guess work, but food for thought. You might conceivably have the oldest survivor. That number of 600 would also include Sambas. Unfortunately I dont know the ratio of Samba's to standard deluxes sold. I would like to know if anyone else does.? Somewhere i have a record of the earliest known 21 window, I just cant put my hands on it!!!\n<br>\n<br>Keep up the great work, love it!",
