    "content" : "thanks for the replies guys, and in response..\n<br>\n<br>I realise that a lot of work has gone into these 2.5 inch spindles - it's not the product, its the fact that the service is shocking - been waiting 4 months now and Alex just will not respond to my calls, emails or texts (don't do facebook) - if I can't even get so speak to him before he takes my £400 off me, can't imagine I am going to get much in the way of after-sales service if there's a problem.\n<br>\n<br>Also, as VWJim points out, there is no shakedown on these as they are a new product, and have no confidence in there being any comeback in view of the lack of response to any kind of communication.\n<br>\n<br>So, whilst these would be ideal, I think deep down that this is starting to look like a non-starter!\n<br>\n<br>Didn't really want to start cutting through chassis rails to fit a steering box raise as may go down the steering rack route in the future.\n<br>\n<br>I started off with 185/75x15 tyres on. When I first fitted the beam, the adjusters were set at a nice ride height &amp; I had about 1.5inch clearance tyre to arch. The ground clearance was fine but like I say the ride was crap.\n<br>\n<br>So, I raised the adjusters as far up as they will go (the top adjuster nut is just touching the front shift rod &amp; the bolt is at the top of the adjuster, so no more to go) - the ride is lovely. At the same time, I have also changed my alloys, and the front currently have 165/50x15 tyres, so I now have about 4.5 inches of clearance, tyre to arch.\n<br>\n<br>So, if I fitted 3.5drop spindles, I may just have enough clearance (although I may get some scrub loaded up) tyre to arch, but I think the ground clearance could be a bit marginal - I did want to change the tyres to 165/65 to get some more tyre height back, but not sure that will give me any tyre-to-arch clearance then!\n<br>\n<br>Maddison- I know you are a lover of coilovers - didn't want to wind my adjusters down again as the ride will get harsh again (especially with the additional suspension provided by the springs), but was thinking...what if I was to fit 3.5inch dropped spindles &amp; then coilovers to get the suspension back up by ab inch to get my desired ride height (I understand that coilovers will increase the ride height by about 1inch?) - surely that would give me a nice ride and the right height??",
