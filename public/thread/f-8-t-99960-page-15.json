I am planning on fabricating boxed feet approx 25mm high by 60mm x 60mm for mine but noticed some cars just weld directly to the floor or chassis?? Ang ideas as to why, it would save me a hell of a lot of work!!\n </div>\n <br>\n <br>From my post in the roll cage thread \n <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n <br>\n <br>\n <!-- m -->\n <a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.msauk.org/assets/153191commonregulationsforcompetitorssafetyk.pdf\">https://www.msauk.org/assets/153191comm ... afetyk.pdf</a>\n <!-- m -->\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>Cheers pal, I had a quick read and decided Im not going to race!! It means more mods to what Ive already done, and to be honest as long as its safe for my family which it will be, Im happy. It would mean I would have to compromise too much to get it all to conform to regs, and the interior would suffer, sheila says no!\n<br>\n<br>Onto today progress and theres no going back now...\n<br>\n<br>Started off by welding in two foot plates for the main hoop, they are 120mm x 100mm x 4mm and they fold up the back of the front wheel tub behind the bulkhead. All welded in...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/A2385855-7DAE-4701-B354-DC4D82201448_zpsvidjs8yj.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Then set about the front anti leg mashing frame, already had a bit done on this before so it was a matter of continuing where I left off really and mirroring it, but I decided whilst the front panel was off to strengthen things considerably...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/A250E134-A717-4341-B7F6-61F56AAD1522_zpsfcy7kz3y.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>If you look closely you will see Ive popped a piece of 40x40x4 in the crossmember and welded it in, then sandwiched it to drop the uprights off, its extremely strong!! That enables me to attach the drops from the halo bars to it, which will really help in a frontal impact...\n<br>\n<br>Gave it all a coat of rattle can primer for the night and popped the front panel on with some clamps just to check clearances, all good, got the left side to sort tomorrow, the tubes are ready as I bent those today, just need welding in, then its the halo bar and the A-pillar drops... Tomorrow!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i961.photobucket.com/albums/ae100/paulnvickyg/Splitty/1734BE60-563B-4909-AB76-8DFD4830A99E_zpszctwy3en.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Cheers guys, hope it makes sense!!",
