    "content" : "So, yesterday, I helped a new buddy out as he found a bus he fancied in Scotland, but the transport company let him down, so I agreed to drive up with him and if he liked it, I’d drive it back assuming the purchase was successful. All went well, and we got home safe at 2am this morning. It was a 71 bay, and a bloody pleasure to drive, responsive and awesome brakes, drive straight as an arrow with great power on motorway. \n<br> \n<br> Then today, I collected my bus from the partial resto (Ive had all nearside work done) (Offside is next winter) I drove it home with its .... / scary brakes, and wayward steering, and honestly felt so bloody deflated. I expected to have a smile on my face the width of the channel, but alas not. Am I alone in this feeling ?\n<br> \n<br> Since arriving at home, I’ve started working out how much additional coin it’s going to cost before it feels safe to drive !\n<br> \n<br> (servo brakes or discs on front, but what to do about the bloody steering ?) I’ve pinged Jim about the servo brakes as that’s got to be no1 job next, but the steering is appalling really compared to the bay I drove back last night. So, is there any solution ? I’m not a purist and not a show n shine type of guy, I want something that drives well and feels safe. Should have had my username as mr depressed lol",

I think it’s just that I’ve been waiting so long for it now, and was once again shocked at how poor the handling and braking is. I’ve spoken to Jim about servo, and looking at red9 wishbone steering following a message from stevep who went that route. Looks great but €3k ouch.\n<br> \n<br> So brakes first, then assess next money drop after next years body work coin drop",

    "content" : "Nocky, don't lose heart in your bus. I agree with Dougie - miles more smiles in a Split.\n<br> \n<br> I bought what I thought was a \"sorted' bus but I've spent literally months trying to sort out the suspension and the brakes. As Jim says, a lot is about how it's set up rather than massively changing the 'ingredients'. Ride quality, handling and looks are subjective and many people will tell you different things. The previous owner of my bus spent a lot of money on modifications but it was all for nowt as it just hadn't been set up correctly - a bit like buying a designer suit that doesn't fit properly!\n<br> \n<br> On mine at the front the links were loose, the beam adjusters were at different positions (Mainly to avoid fouling the gear linkage), . The CE rack had a duff balljoint and wasn't centred correctly (I'm still not convinced about the CE rack though). Front tyres were too low profile and the wheel alignment out by a mile. Leaking cheap coil overs just added to the fun.\n<br> \n<br> On the rear the rear brake drums were badly distorted caused by overheating of the rear shoes and a 'home made' spacer bar. My rear shocks were too long giving only 20 mm of compression before bottoming out and I needed shims made to reduce the negative camber associated with the CE IRS.\n<br> \n<br> Gear change was like stirring porridge and someone had fitted the Buttys throttle linkage in a way that defies the logic of any sensible person. \n<br> \n<br> Apart from the new shocks. tyres and brake drums it didn't cost too much to sort and I'm almost there now - just keep fiddling with the rear height to get it to sit right and have the ability to raise it when I have a 'full load' on the adjustable spring plates. \n<br> \n<br> I have CSP discs but no servo - I'm OK with this for now as I've grown up driving older classics with no servo. I'm good to 'stamp on the brakes' but may upgrade to a servo when I change the hard brake lines next year particularly if I let my wife loose behind the wheel.\n<br> \n<br> I've spent more time under the bus than driving it. If it hadn't been for lockdown this would've been really annoying. The most pain hasn't been in my wallet but in my ears from my wife complaining that I'm always 'under that bloody bus'!",

I fitted a Vintage Speed shifter as I needed more height and I prefer the look compared to the other makes. On fitting the shifter I realised all the plastic bushings and the rear coupler were shot so needed to replace them too. \n<br> \n<br> I've probably been somewhat unfortunate (or a perfectionist) but its cost me more in terms of time than money. The ingredients of a solid, nice looking bus with the 'right bits' were there but just needed sorting and lockdown gave me the opportunity to get it right. I've also replaced the cab floor corners as the previous replacements were badly welded - didn't need doing BUT I prefer butted seam welds to an inch of overlap and a blob of weld every 4 inches or so... \n<br> \n<br> To add to the analogy - if it was a suit it would be the equivalent of 'having it taken in a bit\"!",
