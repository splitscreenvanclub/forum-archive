    "content" : "Due to ill health I am looking to sell off a number of things from my past years of being a VW owner, and hoping to supplement my income with the sale of my SSVC mags which are from no.2 August 1983 up to No.160 Jan 2010. (No.1 was only a single page print off). Definitely some historical documentation and information. They are not a fully complete collection but also includes around 40 extra double copies and also around 30 T2 Transporter Talk magazines from June 2003 to 2010, over 200 in all. Obviously due to weight they would need collection from north Birmingham.\n<br> PM me if interested\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=38156&amp;sid=1f3508798b35597f7c5b72fa31f1b841&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=38156&amp;t=1&amp;sid=1f3508798b35597f7c5b72fa31f1b841\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Polish_20200217_132755458.jpg\" title=\"Polish_20200217_132755458.jpg (146.11 KiB) Viewed 795 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
