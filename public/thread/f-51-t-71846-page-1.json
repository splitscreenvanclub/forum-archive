    "content" : "'53 Bd deluxe, bit of a 'taster' advert this to see what happens! Dont like it when people put that but i can understand now. \n<br>June ' 53 deluxe, birth cert included , relevant import papers etc. A rare opportunity to own 1 of less than 150 known worldwide. It's a project for someone with lots done and lots to do, lots of parts with it, including some very nice nos cargo doors , nos engine lid etc that i've picked up over the years. I have a build thread on here, although i havent updated it for a long time and lots has been done since but it will give you an idea of what it's about (no porsche parts now) .\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=34719\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=34719</a>\n<!-- l --> \n<br> If your serious and genuinally intersted pm me and we can get to talk more in detail , send pics but please no dreamers. I realise i have to put a price on here which is very difficult , i guess i can only go by what i have in it which is around 20k , i am willing to deal , split it up if there are parts you dont want , px for something ,try me, what you got!",
