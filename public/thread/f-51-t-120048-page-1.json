    "content" : "Here goes...dont wont to sell though recent family addidtion leaves no time for me to complete a restoration. Its still got MOT for 18 days I doubt I will take it in for another. The van has no interior. Its RHD. It is not original. It has narrow 5s..dics on front. IRS rear to a type 3 auto box to a type 4 2.0 engine. Full length aftermarket sunroof and its got naff alloys. This will be a project obviously. The van overall is not a basket case. I doubt its one for the purist. Ive owned it for 18 months and ive had the engine rebuilt in that time. Re the engine its a porsche fan conversion on weber 36s. The engine bay has been restored with new Alan Schofield panels throughout. The van is 12 volts too with leisure facilities and night heater. I have no real idea its value. I can only go off sites. Is Â£11995 way off ? Ive not put the van on e bay. Its just on here for now. Welcome to view..im located NW.\n<br> \n<br> VAN NO LONGER FOR SALE..APOLOGIES ALL.",
