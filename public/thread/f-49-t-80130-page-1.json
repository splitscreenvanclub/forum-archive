I'd like to put them up for a fair price. Not doing myself out of money, but not trying to turn anyone over either. \n<br>Someone on here was very reasonable when buying an item off me today and it has made me remember what I like about this hobby. The fraternity. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>Please provide me with your thoughts on a fair price for the pair and I'll put them up at that price in the for sale section.",
