It would be one hell of a phoenix from the flames.\n<br>\n<br>I had a bit of a scare when I took my bus out of winter storage a few weeks ago. Filled it right up to the first click of the pump, which for me was just below the filler cap and headed off down the A1. There was a really strong smell of petrol and when I got home fuel had forced its way through the top of the tank via the gasket for the sender unit. Got the phone in there to take a few pics and judging how I've not much paint left on the top of the tank it looks like its not the first time. I've got a new gasket ready to go in. In the meantime I'm not filling it up past half way just in case. I've got R9 fuel lines in there and an automatic fire suppression system. Pays to be safe.",
