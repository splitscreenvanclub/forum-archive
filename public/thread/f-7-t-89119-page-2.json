    "content" : "Hi guys,\n<br>\n<br>As someone who uses the tracker system to find stolen cars I thought I would put my bit in. Th VHF trackers can be very good. When you find your car is stolen you call tracker and they can activate it/ boost the signal. Police cars and helicopters that have the receivers fitted can then search for the signal. This is not always as easy as it sounds, you need the right equipment and to be close enough to get a reception. It's easier on open or flat ground, the signal obviously travels further. Even if you do get a signal it's difficult to work out where its coming from. Bounces off buildings etc, or could have just passed your area doing 100mph on the motorway and by the time you Sus out you have a signal it's gone again. More often that not they are found parked up somewhere. However they massively increase the chance of getting that vehicle back but will take longer.\n<br>\n<br>GPS trackers are incredible to work with. You can often track them yourself on computer or mobile. Especially good if its just been taken. We love working with them. Get a real time update of where it is how fast it's travelling and we can intercept them rapidly. This obviously has its pros and cons. We have a higher chance of finding your vehicle, including finding the thief.\n<br>\n<br>In my experience very few of the car thieves and burglars carry these signal blockers. To break into a house is relatively easy and you need few tools. The more things like this you carry the higher chance police will find them when they get stopped and searched and they will get arrested for going equipped. Far easier to nick the car and the. Park it up somewhere, then wait a day. If the car gets recovered likely it had a tracker if not then it probably didn't.\n<br>\n<br>I recommend the GPS systems but they are expensive, I hope one day to be able to afford it.",
