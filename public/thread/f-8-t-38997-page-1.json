    "content" : "Hi all\n<br>\n<br>Only just joined the site and joined the club at vanfest last year so yet to meet any of you, hope to get my van on the road by may so will hopefully make the show season in her. \n<br>\n<br>Purchased from Phil at Buswerks in Cornwall last year, she is a cal import and was in pretty good condition altough missing the majority of main parts. It came as a shell with a straight axle kit already fitted and all the glass present. Apart from that it was bare.\n<br>\n<br>I have since fitted a standard 1.6 engine, complete new 12v loom including a NOS indicator arm arm/switch, wiper motor and all new switches. Full seals kit, new mirrors and trim etc, new cables. The list goes on...\n<br>\n<br>Trying to use majority of original parts and working on renewing all the major mechanics first and will concentrate on the cosmetics maybe next year. Next up is to convert to dual circuit brakes and T2D have just quoted me on a beam refurb with dropped spindles. Bought it to keep long term so should hopefully be up to my usual fussy standards soon \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>Will get some progress pics up soon and will keep it updated as i progress, hopefully with an MOT soon...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s258/karlrowntree/IMG_0581.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s258/karlrowntree/IMG_0539.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s258/karlrowntree/IMG_0538.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for reading \n<br>\n<br>Karl",
