    "content" : "That's a very nice looking bus - as far as the trim insert goes, I'd stick with the red.\n<br>\n<br>Unfortunately, my reason for coming into this thread aren't to do with the bus per se.\n<br>\n<br>I've had a request to have a look at the thread with regard to comments made within the thread about work previously done on the bus. The SSVC have a *very* strict policy of not allowing threads that potentially defame or slander, whether the subject be a club member, forum member (or neither of those). The only exceptions have been when a court ruling has put the matter on a legal footing.\n<br>\n<br>I've had a look through the thread, and I'm bound to say that there are numerous 'undesirable' comments that the subject has described in a PM to me in a completely different light. We're not interested in taking sides, or getting into 'he said/she said' discussions, as they inevitably turn into a slanging match. If you've got issues with a restorer, please take it up with them, not on here.\n<br>\n<br>Slammeddeluxe - I'd like you to edit/remove any references as per above within 48 hrs of your next logon. If you don't know how to, PM me and I'll be happy to explain how, or do it for you. I'd also ask that comments made by others are also edited in a simliar timescale/fashion. I don't want this to sound too harsh, but the above is not open for discussion. It's one of the very few hard and fast rules, and we uphold it vigourously.\n<br>I've come straight into the thread with this rather than PM'ing Slammeddeluxe direct so as to be completely trasparent.\n<br>\n<br>I've got to say, I'm glad this has been tackled by an approach to an admin, rather than (as has hapened on previous occasions) by the parties wailing on each other in one or more threads. I hope that you understand why I've felt necessary to post this.",
