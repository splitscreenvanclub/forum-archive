    "content" : "As a student back in the 90's, I had a Bay window Devon Devonette - 1972 model(early front, late back). \n<br> \n<br> As you say, it was very basic. No pop top. Chipboard cabinets. Middle seat had a back that you could lift up, and it would face either forwards or backwards. Rear seat was two across, with a cooker and sink at the side. And that was pretty much it. Oh, and it had a Devon Devonette sticker on the dashboard above the radio. To be honest though, although basic, it was nice and simple. Who needs wardrobes and extra cupboards?",
