Also most of the bakeries do a nice line in filled rolls a.m. There are two large supermarkets in the town where obviously you can get rolls, tubs of salad, cold meats, milk, fruit etc to do your own thing. Check out the opening hours however - not as liberal as ours, possibly shut all day Sunday.\n<br> Beetle in supermarket at previous show:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1080426.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

You will be allowed through barriers Sat morning and be parked with other Split Vans (and loads and loads of vintage VWs) in areas they have set aside. Then back to your camping spot late afternoon. Details about the rundfahrt and joining in (no need to book but not 100% sure) will be in the pack. Rundfahrt is actually very cool scenic drive with a winch ferry crossing and old fashioned map reading. If you booked in going to the Sat night meal it's a 5 min walk to the hall down the track (torch when when staggering back late is advised!)",

Prior to everones arrival, Bob had asked the permission of the other businesses (that have the remaining industrial units) on the estate if it would be o.k to use their parking areas overnight for the VW`s to camp in and every one of them was o.k with it, so literally the whole industrial estate was covered with VW`s camping and enjoying Bobs excellent hospitality.
