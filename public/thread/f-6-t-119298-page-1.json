    "content" : "Good afternoon all.\n<br> So all out of ideas here - the rear brakes are spot on and the pedal is hard a you like. My split was placed on a rolling road and there is a 100kg difference between left and right. The fronts have been totally overhauled with cylinders, shoes, adjusters and bled and adjusted. Also a new dual circuit m/c has been fitted and there are no leaks anywhere in the system. Yet there remains a 100kg difference on the fronts. Any ideas or tips to get this right?\n<br> Could there be air still in the system or does anyone have experience of this?\n<br> Thanks in advance,\n<br> r",
