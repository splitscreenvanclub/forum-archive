Credit to them for what they do, but I think there's a load of stuff they do by hand and those with hammers and chisels don't always pick up the right jigs for the panel in hand, and holes and bends end up in the wrong place. Easily done, but if it's not picked up before despatch you've ended up shipping a misshapen panel a long way. \n<br>\n<br>Not wanting to start a Gerson vs Autocraft thread, but I had a look round Autocraft's place a few years ago and was really impressed with the way they were organised.",
