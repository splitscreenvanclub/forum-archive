    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>\n<br>I was wondering what sort of BHP and Torque needed to get in.\n<br>\n<br>Say I have a early panel, there is no interior, straight axle and lowered (if that makes some difference to E/T times - air resistance).\n<br>\n<br>I know gearbox ratios and tyre size will affect performance, but there must be a minimum amount of energy needed to get the times needed.\n<br>\n<br>Looking at engine options, so could do with some advice. I already have a type 4 with twin 40's IDF (both under the workbench). I also have an AS41 case. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>Dom.",

    "content" : "Approx 120 plus horsepower is what's needed.\n<br>I had a type IV with a set of 40's and a good BAS exhaust and it just scraped in with a 17.8 - I thought it would be a lot quicker than that.\n<br>Reckon with a stripped out panel you may get away with a little less power but not much unless you're going to put a really short ration box in it.\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps\n<br>\n<br>Orb",

I started with an 1835cc motor and couldn't get near the 18s iirc so went to 2332, then 2332 with fuel injection and turbo and now I'm on nitrous also so probably about 450bhp plus if I want. \n<br>\n<br>I struggled to get under 18 for quite a while as it looked easy but I soon found it to be quite a skill in getting everything to come together. \n<br>\n<br>Five years down the line I'm chasing 12s, my PB is 14.1 without nitrous and being conservative off the line. \n<br>That's my ultimate goal anyway. \n<br>\n<br>It's all about the 60 ft times the rest is relatively easy \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>Good luck!",
