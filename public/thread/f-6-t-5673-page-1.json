Is it ok to run with this in the short term until I can get the engine out (the plug which came out was covered in oil!!!).\n<br> \n<br> My main question is can you get replacement 1500 engines or would I need to think about putting in a 1600 and are there any implications in doing this?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for any help you can give.",
