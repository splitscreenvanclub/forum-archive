    "content" : "Just wondering if anyone has had the same problem as us when booking campsites.\n<br>\n<br>We went to an haven site near Filey at the start of the school holidays. We have the vw and a tent for the kids.\n<br>While I was pitching up a warden came over and said you can't park the camper there it's tents only. I said did you say that to the t4 owners, the transit owners and the range rover with the largest tent I've seen ever. He said there not campers and yours is.\n<br>He suggested paying for a motor home pitch and puting the bus there but leaving the kids at the other side of the camp site in the tent. \n<br>I told him it's not a camper it's a vw van same as the other t4s on the campsite and we are not sleeping in it. He said he will be checking on us( jobs worth)\n<br>I have now just emailed a park resorts site in Wales for a pitch with the same setup and they won't allow me on unless I book 2 pitches (1 motor home pitch and 1 tent only pitch) at opposite sides of the site.\n<br>So you could turn up in a vehicle twice the size of a classic vw with the largest tent available, or a suv with a massive tourer and pay once but own a classic vw and pay double .\n<br>Is this scene tax \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

I had my 25 year old son in one and me and the boss in the other when I asked the women said why not share the tent. Hmm great answer I'm sure my lad would have loved that. \n<br>\n<br>I'm now on the lookout for a awning with sleeping compartments for my grand kids and will probably still be asked to park my van on the carpark or be charged again this really really does annoy me. \n<br>\n<br>Buzzers",
