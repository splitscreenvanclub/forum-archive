    "content" : "There's an interesting little story relating to the 'Bad Custom Paint Job'. The van was originally restored to a pretty much original finish, and was one of the better vans around at the time. It is the fifth from the right on the 1984 AGM line up. But evidently at VW Action a few purists were a bit sniffy about the the use of the non standard colours used on the body work. Soooooo....... The owner Peter Nicholson removed the domed hubcaps, round mirrors etc., and re-painted it over the winter. He said he got the idea of the paint finish whilst staring at the wall in a gents urinal, admiring that multi-coloured fleck finsh that was all the rage in 1980's toilets. When he turned up at the beginning of the new season he re-named the van Bog Standard!\n<br>In the 1984 members line-up he's the guy standing 2nd left in the black tee shirt. I don't think he would mind me mentioning his name. He left the scene a number of years ago, more's the pity.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Fifer",
