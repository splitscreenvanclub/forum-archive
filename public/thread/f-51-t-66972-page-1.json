    "content" : "For sale, `61 RHD single cab, Oz import nearly 10 years ago, was painted then and still looks good, although cannot be described as a mint show truck.\n<br>\n<br>Rebuilt Cogbox with nicer ratios, big nut RGB`s, new brakes all round 2 years ago with dual curcuit master, engine bought as a 1776, though never stripped down, that runs nice with twin Kads. Stainless Bluebird exhaust with heat exchangers, new heater cables, clutch, throttle and handbrake cables too. Hoops and new oak slats, with non original canvas (bit scruffy but fits). Banjo steering wheel, safari`s front and rear, as new 640x15 Firestone crossplies on nicely painted rims plus a set of radials on rims, grey painted hubcaps, `vw` mudflaps all round, nice interior with rubber mat and overcarpet. Roofrack with new oak slats.\n<br>\n<br>MOT`d and taxed till Sept 2010.\n<br>\n<br>All in all a nice usable truck, with as far as I can tell all original panels, and no bodgy welding, that could benefit from some extra tlc if you wanted to `mint it`.\n<br>\n<br>Comes with some spares, including half load bed floor (VW), inner sills, original 1200 engine, early RGB`s and shafts.\n<br>\n<br>Only for sale due to temporary change of direction, may p/ex for RHD notch in good condition (£4k?) plus cash.\n<br>\n<br>£10,750\n<br>\n<br>£9750 without a heap of parts.\n<br>\n<br>PM me if interested, truck on the Isle of Wight.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/P4240044.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/P4240045.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/P4240043.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/PB110061.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/P5100047.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/P5100046.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Winter storage\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i250.photobucket.com/albums/gg275/chaser53/Image018.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
