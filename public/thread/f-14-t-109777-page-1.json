I hear that's the difference with FB?\n<br>\n<br>Everyone's got Facebook on their smartphones etc so I guess it's natural to expect more traffic through there eventually.\n<br>\n<br>Is it time I joined the 21st century????\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Nige",

The app provides a nice option and its available on IOS and Android... Might be worth the club making it more known to sway the balance of the above the other way? Or is there a plugin for the forum available to make the facebook feed available at all, worth asking the admin guys? There has to be another option!!",
