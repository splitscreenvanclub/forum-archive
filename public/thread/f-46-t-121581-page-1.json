Unless you dissolve the rust it will not free up.\n<br> I have had lots of derusting success with white vinegar..\n<br> Immerse and it comes off as a grey black sludge.\n<br> May need to clean the WD40 off first with white spirit so the vinegar can get to and wet the rust.\n<br> when free then WD40 again.\n<br> G",

    "content" : "These rollers are made up from number of thick fibre washers. I free them off by removing the shaft and easing the washers off one at a time. If you are not bothered about originality you can make up a better roller by using a piece of rubber tubing over a new shaft (piece of 6\" nail) then sliding a piece of stainless tubing over the rubber. You can then keep the original piece in your bedside cabinet and gloat over it at regular intervals.
