Are they scared that their crappy suv will throw an enormous stone through the Perspex? Is it dogging code? Is there a prisoner inside? It only seems to be modern caravans, so it could just be their equivalent of scotch guard! Totally useless but they are talked into it by surly sales staff. Whatever the reasoning they need informing it looks silly and pointless. #sillysausages",

Surely it would be better over the screen of the owners car, so that a, they can't be seen, thus embarrassment avoided ,and b, so they can't see to tow the things on the road in the first place. I'll also get to work on my next grumble, possibly trolley wheels!",
