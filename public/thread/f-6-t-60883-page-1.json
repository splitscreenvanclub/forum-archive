    "content" : "If you are running OG Fuchs or gasburners for that matter and decide to run them without an inner tube then you are in danger of having a rapid deflation if the tyre bead gets pushed off the rim slighty.\n<br>\n<br>Modern car rims and replica Fuchs have a groove moulded in them to hold the tyre bead in place.\n<br>\n<br>My original Fuchs don't have a groove to hold the tyre bead in place, so although I'm running tubeless tyres, I'm running them with an inner tube.\n<br>\n<br>Fit a good quailty Michelin inner tube as the cheapo ones are rubbish. That cured my problems with punctures. The rough insides of the tubeless tyre seem to rub the cheapo inner tubes until they pinhole. I switched to Michelin inner tubes and have only had one puncture in 4 years.",
