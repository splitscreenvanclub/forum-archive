    "content" : "Hi, been meaning to post here for ages. A little bit about me and my bus.\n<br>Bought my first split in 1995 a 1965 double cab that had spent most of its life in Teneriffe airport, bought over and registered in UK \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s80.photobucket.com/user/2020mad/media/image.jpg45.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j189/2020mad/image.jpg45.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>Back then everything was shiny, so I followed suit and had a full restoration done, picked up 14 trophys with this in 1996-1997\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s80.photobucket.com/user/2020mad/media/image.jpg46.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j189/2020mad/image.jpg46.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>Moving on I ended up making the tough decision to sell my bus to get a mortgage.\n<br>\n<br>Got myself a T25 to use for shows, but never really felt the love for it, so once settled into mortgage started saving for my Fridolin Fund, anyway saving was going pretty well and was at the point I was actively looking on the samba and throughout Europe. Then my girlfriend (now wife) told me she was pregnant, so a frid would not be practical but another bus would be ok, Green light was on I need to buy a bus before baby arrives or would never afford one. \n<br>A few months of searching, missing a few I liked or others that would not sell to overseas I found a bus that ticked all boxes, early 59 so mot exempt, original paint, original interior, never been welded and bags of history.",
