    "content" : "Curtains are the purple and black pattern. At parents house and in the loft, boxed up. They are in good condition and inline with the bus but look so odd and out of place from a general colour scheme perspective. I had them for the first 4-5 years of ownership and decided to go for the red and cream for everyday use, they look sooooo much better. Bit like the flooring, I have that orange,yellow type pattern and again looks so out of place colour wise, hence the red carpets. Of course the carpets help keep the floor in A1 condition, not sure the van has ever been without carpets.\n<br>\n<br>I have had the bus now since 1998 and it has had only two owners previous. I bought it with a fully documented and MOT verified 42k miles and it's now just over 70k miles. The bus is unrestored and 100% never been welded. It has had paint though, the top in 1985 and the bottom 2001. Hope you enjoy the photos, I enjoyed posting them!!",
