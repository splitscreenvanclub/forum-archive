Are there any watch outs? Do you have any pics? I'm always nervous taking out the drill anywhere near my bus! Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n<br> these are the two bits I have...\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a502/sjtw/photo1_zps925a837a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a502/sjtw/photo-1_zpsbca48e13.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Steve",

I just need to make sure my door cards are screwed on. (They have little plastic plugs that pop into the screw holes at the moment. No way they'd take the weight of the cupboard!) \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br> Thanks for everyone's help.\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
