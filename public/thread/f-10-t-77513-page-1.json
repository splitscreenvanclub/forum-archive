The \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">FAMILY CAMPS </strong>are also now almost \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">FULL</strong>. (we are now filling up the last Family Camps). Clubs will have to close their bookings soon too.\n<br> \n<br> Vanfest regulars will notice that a lot of groundwork &amp; landscaping has been carried out to the site this will give some areas a lot more room, (in particular the Family area), where we have now opened up another wooded camp.\n<br> The Severn Hall has been extended, and there are several other new roadways on the site to improve pedestrian &amp; vehicle access.\n<br> \n<br> We already have a full compliment of traders (over 350 plots).

We are looking for (wherever possible) fairly standard vans from each year of manufacture. This will be done on a first come basis &amp; we will gradually build up a running list of successful vehicles, which will be shown on the website.
