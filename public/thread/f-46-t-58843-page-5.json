    "content" : "I have been making quite good progress on the Torvette lately, this thread has been going for many years so thought I would add some updates .....\n<br>\n<br>To re-cap, this is how the bus looked when I first got it, everything is all original and was in excellent condition considering it's age. The worst of the rust was in the front valance, a little bit in the bottoms of the A pillars, little bits 'n' pieces in the rockers, bottom of cargo doors and the engine lid was pretty buggered.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/633/22537592676_1250a41716_b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We found it locally sitting up a driveway with, tragically, the Dormobile pop-top off the bus letting the elements in to damage a lot of the interior. Many of you may remember a 66 Torvette exactly the same as this one being found in the UK, it turned out that the owner didn't want the interior so it was chucked on Ebay. A long story short, it ended up in my garage in New Zealand, thank you to all those that have helped me get the bus this far!! Below is the actual interior while still in bus.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/619/22537983406_f751aaee46.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And the interior after being removed from bus and how it looked on Ebay!! May not look like much, but for me, this was the Holy Grail\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/666/22549908202_b80f065d34.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Not a lot happened for a few years! due to life just getting in the way, moving house, teenage daughters, excuse after excuse. After shifting towns, jobs and in a new house, I had to build a new triple garage to be able to get going again.\n<br>\n<br>The plan was to do everything myself (except engine and box, already done), all the rust repairs, prep, blending paint over repairs. This bus is still 85% original paint.\n<br>\n<br>I have finally finished all the repairs and have painted everything to blend in with the original paint.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/611/22376764969_9403fbeb8d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5712/22375636450_e37e9299b8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5688/21942410993_295efd40dd.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/22375637840_25833f4e5b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/674/22550015202_8915d666b3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5757/22563581975_ae791f24bd.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/753/22537601386_bf0d5254de.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/21942413393_a9323d2f76.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/629/22550016512_b9b83614ff.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I have used as many original parts to the bus as possible, I was never going to do a full resto, this bus is all about staying original and proudly wearing all it's patina that has taken nearly 50 years to collect. The bus is way too good to anything other with it.",

    "content" : "I still have bits and pieces to finish off the body work but I was a bit over it so decided to start on the interior.\n<br>\n<br>Once the Torvette interior turned up from the UK, I slowly started a major refurbishment. All the cabinets were repaired, the veneer was in a really sad state, it was a case of repairing what I could. Much of it had de-laminated so had to be carefully glued back together, what was beyond repair or rotten away, had to be re-built and then re-veneered. I got really lucky when a mate found an old caravan body grafted onto the back of a split bus, the interior cladding on the walls were an exact match of my interior. What was beyond saving, I was able to remove and use as a pattern to make the repairs, it really was an exact weathered and patina'd match!\n<br>\n<br>As with the exterior, the interior was an attempt at keeping it as true to original as possible, use as much of the original fittings, screws, hinges, brackets etc as possible.\n<br>\n<br>Once all there repairs were complete, I carefully sanded everything back only just enough while still trying to retain many of the knicks and bruises! I then made up my own shellac and applied several coats to give it that low sheen original look.\n<br>\n<br>Some examples of the old and then as they were being installed .......\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/624/22537490436_4ba0cfa4ee.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/685/22537489656_bc4b77664a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/22574698401_bc20a4abf5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5722/22375530360_d0506b164d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I then started on what I had been most looking forward to, making it look like a camper again!!!! I started with the original heavy board above the engine, this was actually in quite good nick but horribly twisted and warped. The purists might notice the extra screws needed to take the distortion out, I will remove these and repair once the board has flattened out. I tried a whole lot of things before installing it to try and get it flat, I soaked it with water and clamped it flat while it dried (didn't work), I applied weights (didn't work), after everything I tried failed, I decided to just screw it down using a few more than originally.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/668/21940724324_029f70864e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/684/22375517260_e3bfb0ae3d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Planning out the laying of the Mad Matz tiles .... this is probably the biggest shift from original, I never saw any of the original flooring, but I'm assuming it had the 'flintstone' lino. I actually prefer these 9\" tiles and I think the colours I chose are going to look awesome. I figured I would never find any of the 'flintstone' anyway. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/640/22537446896_a921d81b0b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/654/22549893402_3336acf514.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

Again, I had the 'ceiling' panels but they were shot. I have made new panels for there, the old ones were covered in a very thin vinyl that was used for head-linings way back when. I couldn't find anything that was even close so I had a satin finish paint mixed and rolled it on with a long pile roller to give a textured finish, they have come up OK. I did the same for the kick panels, these will do for now, I will continue looking for good originals or the correct vinyl.\n<br>\n<br>By the bits down the sides, are you meaning around the rear windows? Everything above the swage line on the inside is all painted grey, there was never anything else, just the painted finish. Around the edges of the pop-top on the inside, Devon have used long narrow panels with the same finish as the original 'ceiling' panels, but in an off white. I found an exact match for this, it was also used above the rear roof cabinet over engine bay, now that this cabinet is installed you can only see it when cabinet door is open!",

I had never seen this before, but have since found this second photo so I believe it to be all original.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/w861mrap9d7dvdl/DSC00492.jpg?raw=1\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/707/21971423433_1b8127223e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>To find this, I'm figuring would be nigh on impossible and got to thinking about how hard would it be to make.\n<br>\n<br>I found a sheet of the same/similar pattern sheet metal, so gave it a crack. I decided to give it some strength by folding it up around a very thin piece of ply. In the photo below it is mounted to what looks like a splash-back, in my Torvette there was a panel here so I'm figuring this was behind the splash-back. I made my splash-back a bit smaller so that I could see the awesome panel I had made!\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5781/22404889740_e222917448.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5624/22578728492_8f697fd7be.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/667/22578727402_5e071eda70.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5701/22603478721_684786e844.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/571/22603474431_4ca0be94a3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/717/21971087383_1db45f3e90.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I then started on the 'box' to hold the stove and the lid that folds down over the stove to hold it all neatly in place. My stove (sorry Graeme), has 2 x flushmount brackets riveted to the back side that I couldn't work out what they were for. The stove has 4 threaded nuts mounted to the bottom that take the 4 short legs if you wish to cook outside, or with he flush mount brackets, you can lift the stove up out of the holder and mount it to the splash-back, genius! \n<br>\n<br>I started with a little cardboard template\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/724/22566260936_f849641846.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5707/22592286855_5e4587b3e9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/614/22592289745_fa7d74b544.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5717/22603496481_0f9ca89dc2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/582/21971105913_02d3d8a94c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5687/22566277776_7d935cac12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/22404412840_a8c5387380.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/612/21971189693_7c8cc4f611.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I then folded up the hinged lid, even modified the hinges to be an exact copy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/726/22604652121_0f71cb42e3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5696/22404421620_73fa4d03c1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/781/21969611594_285c823328.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
