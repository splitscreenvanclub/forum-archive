    "content" : "Very rare and almost impossible to find Barndoor king pin dampers, these were used between 1950 and 1953 only before solid spacers were introduced. \n<br> \n<br> These are used but in great shape, one has a very slight dent that has been worked out and has no effect on the operation of them. Indicated by the red arrow. \n<br> \n<br> Price Â£150 ONO These are rare as hens teeth",
