    "content" : "I've started on the new project, and i cant find the funds to keep both vans. Which is a crying shame as I’ve only just finished her really. And its a very reluctant sale!\n<br>\n<br>1967, RHD Kombi, walk through. Lived in Edinburgh all its life, until it came down to me 18 months ago. \n<br>\n<br>Taxed and tested.\n<br>\n<br>I had a lot of work done over the winter. Offside outriggers, top hat sections, inner and outer sill on the long side, and belly pan. All the panels were from Auto Craft. Van was given another lick of the yellow all over, she is rock solid underneath. Clive, from Dub DNA, Deeside, did an awesome job for me! New door pins and stainless mirror arms fitted too.\n<br>\n<br>Hot 1776, single carb. 009 dizzy, with electronic ignition, and flame thrower coil. Engine runs strong, cruises on the motorway with no problems. Rebuilt 1302 box by cogbox, running creative IRS. Rebuilt brakes all round, shoes and cylinders. Cut and turned beam on the front, and I rebuilt the link pin assy’s last summer, new drag link. Running chromed OE’s, white walls, and yokos all round, loads of tread.\n<br>\n<br>Creative front safari’s, creative side pop outs, and a Wolfsgang rear safari. (US import) All polished and shiney! Paris beetle rag top, which doesn't leak.\n<br>\n<br>When I bought the van I stripped the inside out, and took it all back to bare metal and prepped it for paint. Then had it sprayed in L90D, looks superb! Mad matz floor fitted, full width Bluebird rock and roll bed. All door cards, bed foam, and panels trimmed professionally, and matching! \n<br>Just fitted new front seats, out of an early bay, stripped to frames and painted, new seat pads, HEATED seat kit fitted, and then seat covers from D and B trimming in Blackpool to match the rest of the interior. Oak and elm cooker unit, with space for cooler. Leisure battery, and split charge fitted. Alpine amp, and infinity 6x9’s in the rear, and alpine components in the front. Custom ipod dock, made out of an ash tray, epoxy resin, a milling machine, and some paint! The head unit won’t be coming with the van. Will fit a new table for who ever buys the bus, as its only £15 for a table, and £125 and counting on stickers!!!\n<br>\n<br>Loads of extras like, brand new genuine UK spec headlights, hella. Stainless front badge, VDO vintage tacho, Bugpack ceramic j’s tubes, header, and rear box. Wolfsberg seat belts. The list goes on…… I’ve forgotten loads about the van, so just ask!\n<br>\n<br>I’ve got a pile of recipets, I’ve spent 5k plus since I bought the bus! Sorry to see her go really.\n<br>\n<br>£15,000. ONO. Viewing more than welcome, so pop around from a brew. Real head turner!\n<br>\n<br>Buster, 07734411910.\n<br>\n<br>Loads of pics available, of resto and more of the van!\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/IMGP2488.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1000028.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1000090.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/31052008580.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010256.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010255.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010245.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010262.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010261.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://i484.photobucket.com/albums/rr202/bu54ter/P1010260.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
