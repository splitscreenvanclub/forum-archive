    "content" : "Information is limited on VW do Brasil, here's some info on Vin/chassis numbers:\n<br>\n<br>Brazilian built buses vin numbers did not follow the same format as German built buses vins. Nearly all Brazillian production was LHD. It was only the CKD buses shipped from the vw do Brasil factory in kit form to South Africa that were RHD known as the Fleetline.\n<br>\n<br>Vw do Brasil vin info: \n<br>The chassis/vin no is stamped into the right hand side engine surround panel. There is also a vin plate located in the cab on the passenger side of the overhead air vent\n<br>\n<br>Brazilian Splitscreen Kombi chassis/vin no were numbered sequentially one after the other until the end of factory production in 1975.\n<br>\n<br>1957-1963 (1200/30 PS)\n<br>The vin consists of the sequential chassis number only. eg 30620 was the 306**th vw t2 kombi built in Brazil since 1957. (built in 1961).\n<br>\n<br>1963 (model 1964) - 1967 (1200/30PS)\n<br>The letter B (=Brazil) was added to the vin plus one digit (= year of production) + the sequential chassis number. eg B30672** was the 0672**th vw t2 kombi built in Brazil since 1957. (built in 1963). and B71243** was the 124**th built since 1957. (built 1967). \n<br>\n<br>1967 (model 1968) - 1970/71/72 (1500/42PS)\n<br>The vin consists of the B + the sequential production number. eg B1843** was the 1843**th built in Brazil since 1957. (built 1967).\n<br>\n<br>1970/71/71 - 1975 (1500/42SP) (End of Brazilian factory built splitscreen kombi t2)\n<br>The vin consists of BH plus the sequential chassis number. The H denotes the 1500 engine. eg BH2895** was the 2895**th built in Brazil since 1957. (built 1973). and BH3853** was the 3853**th built in Brazil since 1957. (built in 1975).\n<br>\n<br>if you have any information to add please pm. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
