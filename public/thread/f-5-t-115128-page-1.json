I'll be looking for £150 if I decide to part with it. \n<br>It's been painted silver as the chrome wasn't all that and it looks ok p,us the slats are oak rather that el-cheapo rubbish. If your gutters are good enough you can stand on this baby and the slats won't break in half like some of the tatt that's out there \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
