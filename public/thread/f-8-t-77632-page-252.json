- we find it immensely useful for our driveaway awning (the other best buy!) as it makes the van sooo much bigger to expand into.\n  <br> \n  <br> We have 2 small kids too (well not quite as small as yours) - 10 &amp; 8 - Luke our 8yr old sleeps on the Devon rear engine bed, Grace our 10 yr old sleeps on a Bluebird Hammock/cot bed across the front seats - works very well - until Luke is too big to fit width wise - cross that bridge when we come to it.\n  <br> \n  <br> We used our new van quite a few weekends this summer - the kids will LOVE it.\n  <br> \n  <br> Think about taking a few bikes for the kids - roof rack? - but watch your roof rack if you DO put the Devon rail back on - we almost bought a 3 bow roof rack at Busfest until I remembered our Devon rail &amp; the drive away awning - just be aware of the legs/rail.\n  <br> \n  <br> Really hope to meet you one day - you did a simply stunning job on restoring that - back on page 1 I could not believe you were even gonna try dude - it was that bad.\n  <br> I've restored a couple of cars (MG's Triumphs) back in the day, so I know what it takes - but yours is truly amazing.\n  <br> \n  <br> Hope the awards keep rolling in \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_colors.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":colors:\" title=\"colors\"> \n  <br> Hope the book goes well ;0P\n  <br> \n  <br> p.s loving the Bose - might have to pinch that idea \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">\n </div>\n</blockquote> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Thank you for all your kind words dude \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br> \n<br> yes it was hard but OOOOOO so worth all those hours of slog to get to the end and receive all the comments about Gerry on here and also to my face at meets / shows .....I'd do it all again no problem ...... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br> \n<br> thanks for heads up on the camping stuff and great to know ya kids love it as I'm still to take Claire and the boys away in Gerry \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br> \n<br> Ref to roof rack and the devon rail ...... see bren rolls thread .... he came up with a great idea and he got over the problem of a roof rack and a drive away awning ......\n<br> \n<br> I have not fitted the awning rail as I have a few Ideas myself on attaching drive away awnings but that will all happen next year when camping and testing my thoughts out \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br> \n<br> p.s I take my hat off to you dude for plodding on and reading the whole thread from start to finish ..... the lucky ones got to follow it as time went on but it's no mean feet to have to sit there and fight ya way though all my terrible spelling on here ...so well done and thanks for reading \n<br> \n<br> keep posting mate ... this thread is like a little community all of it's own \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br> \n<br> Chat soon \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Mark",
