Please be on site no later than 08:00 am, otherwise I can’t guarantee your access! Your buses cannot be moved once the show has opened to the public. Exit time approximately 05:00 pm each day (possibly earlier on the Sunday). You can use your bus during the display as much as you want, just don’t attempt to move it. I will have you tickets on the day, any issues call me on 07802 884 583\n<br> Cheers. Rikki",
