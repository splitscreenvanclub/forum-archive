We have a right schedule unfortunately as if all goes well Lima Bean or 'bump' will be arriving beginning of April, and I can't see myself working on the bus past 8 months - I don't think I'd be able to get close enough to do anything.\n<br>\n<br>So, let the hell, sorry, fun begin!",

I almost jumped up and down when the seal came off and they were perfect. A restorer said that they'd be awful and need a load of work, so can stick two fingers up at him now \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> I haven't taken the seals off any other window yet though and know some of them need attention, so not in the clear yet.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/10727042764_b3f68c89fc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2883/10727260803_039119c3b5.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I've managed to undo the bolts that are holding the front driver and passenger window frames in but didn't have a big enough cross head to undo the screws, so that's tomorrow's job. Also made a start on removing the blinking seals round the cab doors - believe it or not, they're original and glued on, very cracked and a b*stard to get off. Any tips?\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/10727032654_7c25092f05.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Right, off to post some questions on how to get certain things out.",
