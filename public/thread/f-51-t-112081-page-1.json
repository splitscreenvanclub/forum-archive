    "content" : "Hi everyone\n<br>\n<br>This is an unfinished project that I am considering trading for a bus that is on the road. I have lost steam with this project and have other commitments hence why I am considering this trade.\n<br>\n<br>Current state of the body\n<br>\n<br>Shell is in paint, I can't remember the exact vw colour names but it's velvet green and grey white. The finish of the paint is brilliant and looks arrow straight. The underside has been stone chipped and painted in the same green and looks as good as the topside. Paintwork was carried out professionally.\n<br>\n<br>The following panels were replaced before painting was carried out:\n<br>Front panel lower half\n<br>Front outer valance\n<br>Both outer sills, cargo door inner sill\n<br>Complete cab floor\n<br>Both lower rear corners, where the rear light clusters are fitted\n<br>Lower section of the windscreen frames\n<br>\n<br>All panels used were either Autocraft or klassicfab.\n<br>\n<br>Creative engineering IRS chassis legs have been fitted as per their instructions.\n<br>\n<br>Apart from the engine cover, the doors are unpainted. Cab doors are in good condition, cargo doors have had repairs carried out on the bottom six inches.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is unregistered, but I have the customs form from when it was imported and I also have a vw heritage certificate from the museum in Germany.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Components\n<br>\n<br>I have kept all the original parts from the bus when I stripped it down, apart from the original gearbox/reduction boxes assembly.\n<br>\n<br>I have collected a very nice set of parts for fitting this van out, all of which are new and unused:\n<br>\n<br>1776 cc engine, built by Laurie Pettit\n<br>Serpentine belt kit\n<br>Solex ict twin carb kit\n<br>Bears 4 speed IRS gearbox, welded 3rd and 4th gears with up rated diff\n<br>CSP front disc brake kit\n<br>Creative engineering (CE) front safari window kit\n<br>CE rear disc brake kit\n<br>CE pop out window frame kits x 6\n<br>CE cab door window frame kit\n<br>CE steering rack conversion kit\n<br>German quality fuel tank\n<br>German quality front and rear bumper set, with over riders\n<br>356 replica wheels, unpainted.\n<br>Rocket Ronnie wiring loom\n<br>\n<br>For the IRS conversion, I also have the required original bay window spring plates and hub castings.\n<br>\n<br>Once completed this will be a very nice bus.\n<br>\n<br>The body now needs fitting out, only the front badge has been fitted so far. All the original components to be refitted need overhauling.\n<br>\n<br>I'm afraid that I am unable to upload photos to this site at the moment however I am able to send photos to an email address. I have been taking pictures through the whole project which I started in 2010.\n<br>\n<br>If a trade like this is of interest to you then please send me a PM to discuss.\n<br>\n<br>A few points:\n<br>I am not selling any of the components separately\n<br>At the moment I only in the consideration stage\n<br>I am willing to be quite flexible on what is traded\n<br>I would be willing to have cash involved either way as well\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Price - what have you got to trade?????\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks,\n<br>\n<br>Nick",
