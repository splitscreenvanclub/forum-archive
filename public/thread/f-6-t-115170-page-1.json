    "content" : "Hi guys, we'll finally got the bus back on the road after a 2year overhaul of running gear and upgrades. Thanks for all the forum help over the months. \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji106.png\">\n<br>\n<br>After taking the bus for its MOT yesterday which was its first drive in over 2years and considering the work that's been carried out I expected a few teething problems. \n<br>\n<br>The problem which I'm having at the moment is selecting gears. I can get all 4 including reverse but not a clean selection. I've watched vides on utube and links on how to adjust via this forum but no joy. I have installed one of them diamond shape housings which sits on top of the plate which I think is called a quick shift devise?? \n<br>\n<br>Next time I get back out the garage I'll rebuild the shifter to stock and try again, any ideas though.",

I manage to change the front plastic bush but when trying to change the rear bush it broke in my hand so I had to leave the rear. Shifter rebuilt to stock as well. \n<br>\n<br>Reconnected back up and still had a bad selection. When driving I can change up but not back down through the gears ???? But idling I can select up and down fine. \n<br>\n<br>Some background information being I've got a new highway flyer gearbox installed with the nose cone and hockey stick off my original bus gearbox.",

The synchro hubs can be 'sticky' causing the change-down problem you are having. Are you sure that the clutch is working properly? Sometimes the release bearing slips off the fork on one side if the clips are weak. Also worth rechecking the rear coupling to ensure the screws are tight and well seated in the dimples on both shafts.",
