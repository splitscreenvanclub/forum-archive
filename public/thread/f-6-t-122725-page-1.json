    "content" : "I had this on my van over the summer, in France and it went from being noticeable, to very bad just before we got to the ferry port, symptoms were exactly as you describe. Turns out after 10 years in my van and running fine, the gland nut had become loose so flywheel was grinding on the inside of bellhouse of gearbox. Got so bad that we had to be trailered home from Portsmouth. Had I known the problem and tightened the gland nut as soon as I heard it, might have saved a rebuild but the flywheel, crank and clutch were all damaged, apart from that internals were in good shape considering its unknown history when I bought engine, so rebuild not as costly as it might have been. Your problem might be the same or different but recommend getting an expert eye on it before driving it anywhere, engine out to inspect is where I'd start.",

You have to pull the engine out to access the bearing.",
