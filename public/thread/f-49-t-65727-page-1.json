I'm looking at getting a wooden headliner cut out similar to those that you find on e bay.\n<br>\n<br> My question is do you need any extra parts to get this to fit? i.e battons etc. Or does it just slot in place?\n<br>\n<br> Cheers\n<br>\n<br> Nick",

    "content" : "The original EZ camper ply headlinings (and the Sundials, and Rivieras) used side wooden battens as Nick says. More importantly they also used two wide centre battens since, unlike single across pieces like s042 - they go under tension to the middle of the roof, and are screwed in underneath an overlap piece which then hides it all. Likewise at the edges to the battens - they screw in under tension. And I mean quite a lot of tension.\n<br>\n<br>I recently put in an EZ camper OG interior into my 11-window standard, and it's a bit of a job.\n<br>\n<br>The wooden battens that sit in the inner gut area *must* be angle-cut to force the ply in at correctly, otherwise it wont sit right (it should mirror the radius of the integral roof supports).\n<br>\n<br>Personally I prefer the look of the EZ and SUndial styles, rather than the straight-across of the s042...not su reif it's easier to fit though. The first thing is to be fit centre battens that screw intot he roof supports, so you've got somethign to work to.\n<br>\n<br>Might have some pics of the various stages if anyoen is interested.\n<br>\n<br>Theere are also issues depending on whether you have the wardrobe/upper locker, and what sort of cut-outs you want for the rear upper hinges...and also what you want in the cab, depending whether you have factory slots for roof cards, or in my case, the grippers for a cloth headlining. It can be done in the front too (did mine) but it's a bit more of a head-ache.\n<br>\n<br>Having recently been through it all, I might be able to help a bit of anyone has any questions. I also have a an original spare EZ rooflining (keeping for now) which I could measure up for templates....\n<br>\n<br>And you'll want to seal it properly both sides if using your bus as a camper....but that's another story.\n<br>\n<br>Ben",

    "content" : "The original US wooden interiors such as Ezs etc seem to have cheated don the back bit by hiding the mess with the overhead locked. If you're not doign one of these, I'd suggest the plastic moulded tailgate hinge covers (white) and cut slots roudn these. But you'd still want some battening between these under the rear lip to attach the ends to.\n<br>\n<br>Personally, I'd go down the overhead locker road, but that isn;t simple and depends on having the long wardrobe on one side if you emulate the original US interiors.
