How do these come out? The plastic dome part has been take out, do I have to ublot the large disc inside the box to remove the shaft?\n<br>\n<br>Also, have taken off the nose cone, how do I get the main gear assy out? Only changing all the gaskets to hopefully stop leaks, box works fine other than that.\n<br>\n<br>Any help appreciated - doing it all tomorrow.\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks",

It's me brothers box and trying to stop some leaks (after being sent back to the restorers to correct a 4th gear problem - given up on sending back again, especially as a number of major bolts were loose or missing, namely one of the 4 engine bolts, two of the 4 spring plate bolts on one side).\n<br>\n<br>Worse that can happen is we need a new one. Best is we stop the leaks and all good to go.\n<br>\n<br>Trying to get out the piece behind the nose cone, a few bolts and we thought it would pull out and change the gasket and put back together, looks like a much bigger job though.Take it the drive shafts have to come out to remove the main gear?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks again - really appreciated.",

Only need to get the main housing off so I can change the gasket - that's where it's leaking from. Got all the parts just couldn't get the main gear out. \n<br>\n<br>So I need to take out the shaft, this will get me into the main opening. Is there bolts in there to undo? Somthing's certainly holding the main gear housing onto the box - all the other bolts I can see are undone. \n<br>\n<br>Worst case is a new box!!! Best is I stop the leak.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks again for your help - I've not stripped a box before but have another to do after this one.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks again.",
