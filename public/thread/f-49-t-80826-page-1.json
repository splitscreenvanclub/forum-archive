    "content" : "Personally I used 12mm Medex (external MDF) It's marvellous stuff - really dense and not affected by moisture. Most sheet materials are available in larger format than 8X4 but if you attempt to fit the floor in one piece it will be a pig of a task to try and get it in, so I reckon you are better off sticking with the 'two-piece' design. All just my opinion of course.",
