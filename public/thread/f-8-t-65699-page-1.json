At this time it was painted up in its current guise for use in the Danish TV series, Kronniken, roughly translated 'Better Times' kind of like our Heartbeat. It was a quick tart up job that was done purely to use it as a stage prop more or less, so this bad work will all have to come off/out and the original issues sorted that lay underneath this paint. Here are a few pics of it prior to having the Bella paint popped on...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/earlybella1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/earlybella2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

    "content" : "And so, we jump to a few years later, the Kronniken series had moved on to the 60's so no longer needed the bus, so it reverted back to the previous owners, who decided to pass it on. It then came to the UK, where it has had a variety of owners. Some of you may remember seeing it on ebay on more than a few occasions. \n<br>\n<br>So, it eventually came my way. This is the day I collected it from Matt. The previous owner to Matt had started doing some work to it, but it was not exactly working in the right direction, as you'll see later. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1060790.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>As with every bus, there are good bits and bad bits... this one has bad roof gutters and front end. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> Heres a pic of the makeshift brace slapped in to make it work for the TV series that held the front on/up? \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080122.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>and some more of the bad bits:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080120.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080123.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080091.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080094.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Spot the wag! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1953%20Bella/P1080097.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So, it was time to go shopping for cutting discs! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",

The spotters amongst you will have noticed how the roof kinks down at the B pillar on the offside.. This is due to ancient accident damage from a crash years ago.

The 2ft pie cut from the B pillar up into the roof skin helped ease that back up again! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>Got the cab door back on and hanging in the gap correctly now, although the hinges on the door need work, got the rest of the cab floor in, and also got the front inner in, so a productive few days again! Waiting on some autocraft bits now so I can get the roof nailed, then I can cut all the rot out of the chassis and plug that together. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
