Apart from the top bracket on the unit nothing else holds the bottom to the door.\n<br>\n<br>The other holes will be for screws to keep the wooden panel behind the spice unit in place and holes for your bracket.\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps and yes my spice unit also rattles, don't think you will ever manage to keep the rattle free!\n<br>\n<br>Dr G. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
