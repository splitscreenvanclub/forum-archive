    "content" : "I had something similar . Sometimes the bus would start fine and have no problems for months and every now and then I would get the ignition lights come on I'd turn the key and Nothing ,EVERYTHING would be dead, even the radio! If I disconnected and then reconnected the battery it would all come back to life, until I turned the ignition switch again.\n<br> And then just as suddenly it would all work again.\n<br> I eventually cured it by by redoing connection of the main lead from the battery to the starter motor at the battery . When removing the lead from the battery it struck me that the cable was too bendy just where it was fixed to the battery connector, I assume that several of the strands of the cable had broken over the years and that at times not enough current would get through.I just cut off the last inch or so of cable and refitted the terminal connector ( I'll admit I don't understand why everything went dead until disconnected and reconnected!) Since then I've had no issues with starting so it must have done something.",

Got to my destination, turned her off then on again a few times and all was good!\n<br>\n<br>So if you're having similar problems and you've checked all the suggestions above, changing the little brass starter motor bush is a good thing to try before trying to track down a OG starter or fitting a hot start relay.\n<br>\n<br>Easy to fit if your engines out, but not impossible with it in.\n<br>As I said above, Steve Saunders had made a puller out of the end of a bolt to slide through the brass bush and try to catch the back edge and pull it through.\n<br>\n<br>A suggestion that I got a comple of days later was to use a self tapper to screw through the centre of the bush, as the tapper hits the back it starts to push the bush towards you and you can then yank it out.\n<br>\n<br>So fingers crossed, problem is solved.\n<br>Thanks for all the advice everyone.\n<br>Love this forum!",

The switch is used to switch the relay which is less load for the switch. I fitted one yesterday to a chaps bus in about 45 mins. Its worth doing even if you don't have the problem! Steve",
