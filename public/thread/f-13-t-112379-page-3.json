But how about BEFORE &amp; AFTER bus pics. \n<br>\n<br>First pic showing how you got your bus and second how it is today. The theme could cover some brilliant restoration buses which I think inspires us all and also those members with history related buses. Ie a pic from the 60's / 70's of their bus and scene and a pic today showing how times, moderations, colour schemes and fashions have changed. Might be fun and allow lots to enter. \n<br>\n<br>8 Bus we can talk via pm.",
