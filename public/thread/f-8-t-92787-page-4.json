    "content" : "I needed some wiring to finish the engine so before the halfrauds opened, i thought i`d look at the handbrake - i had to sort out a way of connecting the vw cables to the porsche 944 handbrake mechanism.\n<br> \n<br> I didn`t get a picture of the porsche handbrake mechanism but its basically a pair of shoes which push against the inside of the disc - genius!\n<br> \n<br> The porsche handbrake connects to this with a pin. I cut a slot in the back of the mechanism so the vw cable could hook round it. I then had to make some highly engineered custom tubes to space the handbrake out. Oh - but i don`t have a lathe and some nice tubes so some copper piping and duct tape had to do \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> Obviously i `ll get these properly done before the mot! But for now its better than no brakes at all!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1453.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1456.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1457.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Finished the engine off this morning \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> All good and running! Bit of a shriek from the pulley but that was soon sorted out with a quick hammer applied to the tinware behind it !\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1472.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I would have liked to get the van moving which meant reconnecting the gear shift but unfortunately the connecting bit between the gearbox and rod was the wrong that i`d been sent, so i concentrated on getting the front end in the air and the front spindles off ready for refurbing and flipping.\n<br> \n<br> When i came to the drums, somehow and i`m not sure how, there was rat sh*t even inside one of the front drums! Anyway, i got them off with not too much trouble - they`re up for sale on the forum now as they didn`t llok too bad - no scoring in them.\n<br> \n<br> I reckon this van must have been used for offroading in the desert mud or something as the fron suspension has about an inch of dried dirt all over it - i was literally prying off chunks with the screwdriver to get at the bolts!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1460.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1461.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1462.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1464.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75169080/van/diary/24/Resized%20Photos/IMAG1465.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
