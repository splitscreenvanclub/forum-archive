Interior. \n<br>Trouble is my table is 525mm wide, not the standard 625mm. \n<br>\n<br>I've been offered a magazine rack that suits a 625mm set up but I'm not sure if it will fit. (Thanks Kev)\n<br>\n<br>Unfortunately I never measured the gap between the seats before I removed it from the bus I bought it from. \n<br>\n<br>The piece in the picture is 625mm wide so is this part of the bed set up which would mean the gap between the seats would be 625mm and the magazine rack would fit!!!?????!!!!?!?!?\n<br>\n<br>Sorry for all the unknowns.\n<br>\n<br>Any help would be appreciated.",
