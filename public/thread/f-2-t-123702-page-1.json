    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br> \n<br> New on this forum as a member, but been browsing as guest for a while.\n<br> \n<br> Currently have modern VW but looking to get a splitty for weekends away with the family - and as it's weekends, and the family, I need it to be able to keep up with modern traffic, be reliable (reasonably), stop well, and so be able to get us safely a reasonable distance in a weekend - we live in the Midlands so would want to visit Wales, the Lakes, Devon/Cornwall (long weekend), etc.\n<br> \n<br> As I understand it, having the front brakes converted to discs, the rear changed to independent rear suspension and hence losing the reduction gearing, and putting in rack and pinion steering are all common and effective mods. Am I correct? If so, what sort of budget should I have for these?\n<br> \n<br> Now, the real question is, what sort of van should I buy if I want to do this to it? I understand Brazilian imports are cheaper, and getting a van in perfect original condition is probably daft as I'll be reducing its value f I make it less original..... Should I consider a more modern engine (am happy top get places at 60-70, but not 30-40)?\n<br> \n<br> As for interiors, I'm happy to do the work to fit, or even build, a custom interior so am not overly bothered bu this, but would I be better off looking for a bus already done, ordering iii myself from a decent shell? Or should I buy a mostly wreck and get it rewelded etc and go from there?\n<br> \n<br> Budget is flexible but I want good value for money, essentially. Am thinking an OK Brazilian bus imported, then do the modernisation and maybe the engine if its needed and the interior is probably the most cost effective way....\n<br> \n<br> But I'll happily be put right by the more knowledgeable people on here.... Suggestions, links, budgets etc all welcomed.",

    "content" : "I think your best bet would be to get to as many shows as you can and speak with as many different owners as possible. Nobody will be shy when it comes to talking about their own van. \n<br> How much of the work can you do yourself? If you're paying somebody else to do the work it can get very expensive. Very, very expensive.\n<br> For all the mods you mention there are alternatives, servo instead of discs, straight axle or IRS, there's nothing wrong with well maintained good condition steering either, you don't want to totally remove the character of your bus.\n<br> Modern engine? Do you mean an aircooled flat 4 but bigger? \n<br> I am biased but I would also suggest you join the club \n<a href=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/join/\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ssvc.org.uk/join/</a> . Owning a split is not a prerequisite to joining and will give you a real insight into living with one, remember even the youngest German made is 52 years old now. \n<br> Where in the Midlands are you?",

    "content" : "You will get lots of different opinions but as said before everyone likes talking about their bus.\n<br> If you want to do all the changes and money isn't a big object why not buy one already done to what you want? Getting all the mods done will be more expensive I think. So if you want value for money that's the way I would go. \n<br> I've got an almost stock bus with a 1600 SP engine and do about 60 on the motorway. Although I try to avoid motorways as it's much nicer to drive through the country side. It doesn't pull away super fast but I like the way it drives. To me driving a bit slower and relaxing while driving is the joy of owning a splitty. If you want it to be like a modern camper why not get a modern camper? But hey everyone to their own. That's why the scene is great. No bus is the same.\n<br> I hope you find something suitable for you and guaranteed you will enjoy it. \n<br> Cheers,\n<br> Gertjan",

Keeping up with modern traffic?? seriously? If by that you mean you want to cruise at 80mph.. stick with your \"modern\" camper and move on. You are missing the point entirely. \n<br> - Do you honestly think that owning a splitscreen is somehow 'upgradeable' to fit your requirements?\n<br> \n<br> Firstly, these buses just work as intended - they will reliably take you wherever you want to go. I have travelled to many many places with with a stock bus. Ignore advice from anyone who advises 'upgrades' such as disc brakes, suspension lowering, straight-axelling etc etc etc. Volkswagen invested a lot of money and engineering knowledge in building these things and they managed to get it right. \n<br> \n<br> That said, over the years, certain safety things like dual circuit brakes and other sensible -non-altering- things like electronic ignition could kind of make sense.\n<br> \n<br> My advice: \n<br> \n<br> - If you want to chill out, drive to capabilities and enjoy your time on the open road, have a great quality of life experience with your family.... get the best STOCK bus you can.\n<br> \n<br> - If you want to adapt a bus to your 'requirements or needs' or think a split would be cool on image/looks alone, you are looking at the wrong solution. Get a caravan!\n<br> \n<br> Good luck with your search and enjoy!",
