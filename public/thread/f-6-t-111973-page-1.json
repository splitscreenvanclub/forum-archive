    "content" : "Hi everyone, \n<br>\n<br>On the way back from an 80 mile trip, i seem to have developed an issue. I noticed a slight sqeal from the gearbox and then my clutch started to stamp and some times judder on clutch control. Then a little later i started to lose my forth gear, or just couldnt get it in. The coupling looks fine still. \n<br>\n<br>Any ideas of what this could be, do i need a new clutch? New gearbox mounts? What can i look for? \n<br>\n<br>Could they be linked, they seem to hapen together?\n<br>\n<br>Many thanks\n<br>\n<br>Karl",

    "content" : "Hmmm - sounds like clutch release bearing to me if you can feel it through the pedal.\n<br>\n<br>If the clutch is'nt clearing properly that will give you selection issues - but normally 1st &amp; 2nd are worst for that (lower geared)\n<br>So check your cable too.\n<br>\n<br>I've had my clutch cable 'unwind' itself on long motorway journeys before now - a turn of two of the nut and its fine again.",
