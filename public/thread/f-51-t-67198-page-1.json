    "content" : "Hi there folks, my friend James is selling his rather amazing bus, hes not a forum member so hes asked me to pop it on here for him\n<br>\n<br>cut n pasted off his vzi ad\n<br>********************************************************************************************\n<br>Up for sale is my 1960 Westy, with OG subhatch. Imported 4 years ago from Californis by myself. 10 months Mot.\n<br>\n<br>Probably one of the lowest non bagged busses in the UK, the list of Mods is endless. 4 inch narrowed beam, 2 inch Radi-ised tubs, seat contoured to fit without lifting the driver height. Raised steering box, shortened column. Raised and custom idler pin. Big dropped spindles. Notched chasis front and back, doglegged swingplates, shorented shafts.\n<br>\n<br>Solid as you like underneath, always dry stored in carpeted garage since ive owned it and never used in the rain. Surface has been polished and buffed, but not laquered. Wax oiled and anchor waxed in places.\n<br>\n<br>Full interior, double rock and roll bed, loads of cupboard space and nice stereo system, £900 DVD pioneer head unit.\n<br>\n<br>Bus wise its as cool as they come OG safaris, OG subhatch. All pop outs on long spoons. Currently running on OG Sprinstars. These will come with it subject to price paid, 3 Bow rack included.\n<br>\n<br>Motivation provided by 2165 motor running 48's, pushes it along real sweet. Not break neck fast, but so so torquey. IRS freeway flier box and A1 ceramic coating sidewinder exhaust. \n<br>\n<br>Also have westy side tent to go with it.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs533.ash1/31253_10150190917295467_829245466_12741967_7433460_n.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs164.snc1/6131_113148116860_528876860_2769131_7095819_n.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs492.snc3/26868_384931692842_565347842_4100586_7512848_n.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2318/238/32/565347842/n565347842_1483441_9169.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2318/238/32/565347842/n565347842_1483440_8772.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v190/238/32/565347842/n565347842_494898_6164.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Price with everything, Motor, Sprints, Rack, Westy tent and Headunit is £18500, will negotiate lower cost without any of the above. \n<br>Reason im selling is to much money tied up in Dubs , got a LL being built in California. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers Sonny, 07825773635.........\n<br>********************************************************************************************\n<br>\n<br>so contact him \n<br>\n<br>cheers, paul",
