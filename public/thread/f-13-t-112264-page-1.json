    "content" : "So with a few days left of this balmy sunny hot August ( that'll be me being sarcastic )\n<br>Lets see what you got for August's Van Of the Month.\n<br>\n<br>After 7 and a bit years even tho it's not finished I'm putting my 61 in. \n<br>Originally from South Africa, I got it in what I thought was a bad state. But then seeing some of the resto's that have gone on over the years I realised it wasn't that bad \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0362_zpsdpvukcom.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0362_zpsdpvukcom.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>A 61 11 window tintop, Stock height , tried to keep it pretty much stockish. Have put in a later large nut gearbox , Butty's accelerator pedal bit of kit, a anti roll bar ( I know it's all crazy stuff eh ), and then the really sensible bits like a dual brake master cylinder, Firetec in the engine bay and a electric fuel cut off valve. \n<br>For the colour, Clare went to B&amp;Q and picked out the colours from the sample cards they have there.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0364_zpscnjwy2cw.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0364_zpscnjwy2cw.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I'm proud to say we have done most of it ourselves, Simon ( Rusting hulk on here ) refurbed the Steering box and Spindles. And obviously we had it sprayed professionally. But I think everything else was done by us.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0363_zps76u2dmqq.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0363_zps76u2dmqq.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The engine is a nice simple 1600 SP\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/20150525_095205_zps7vmqriq3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/20150525_095205_zps7vmqriq3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/Sid_Sidney/media/IMG_0366_zps3ogia8hh.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k638/Sid_Sidney/IMG_0366_zps3ogia8hh.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I think that is me for starters I'll put some pics of the Interior so far up in a bit \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Andy \n<br>Vote for me and I'll set you free ( obviously that's a lie and I can't really do that )",
