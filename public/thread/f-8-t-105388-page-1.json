    "content" : "Owning Hector has been a joy, but the one big thing which has not cut-the-mustard is the engine. \n<br>It's a 1678 engine, which needs a rebuild, and burns oil. It came with twin carbs, which used to stick.\n<br>\n<br>So imagine \"me\" sitting at traffic light, engine revving \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> The shame of it.\n<br>\n<br>Twin carbs, big this that and the other.... these are fine, so long as they don't go in Hector.\n<br>A replacement stock single-port engine is the name of the game.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Last year I heard about an engine which may be for sale. A former Swiss army engine, which had been used as a water pump, for a grand total of twenty hours. Made in 1991, by VW West Germany. It was one of the last engines (of this type / spec) to be made at this location.\n<br>\n<br>So last weekend, I hired a van, and collected the engine. It was heavy, but did have the advantage of being in an engine frame.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/0half.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The engine is in quite exceptional condition. The Swiss army have been meticulous about servicing things. Every screw on the engine (which has been adjusted) has had a dab of paint put on the thread. \n<br>\n<br>It was a shame to have to touch this engine, but we live in a practical world, where money and space are at a premium.\n<br>\n<br>So the first thing to do is remove the bits I don't need. These are:\n<br>\n<br>* the magneto\n<br>* the solex carb and belt driven rev maintainer\n<br>* the none bus airbox\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>These were easy to remove.\n<br>\n<br>I hope the following two pics show where I have removed the carb and magneto.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.chocksaway.com/engine/4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I am going to be using the money earned from these to buy a refurbished 30 pict 2 carb.\n<br>\n<br>I now need to do some research into the bits I need, before the swap-over starts in earnest (not helped by the flu, which will not go).\n<br>\n<br>But, the main thing is that the engine is in the garage, with abit of cash raised for spares \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">",
