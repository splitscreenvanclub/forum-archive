    "content" : "[url][/url]For sale is my 1965 split screen panel van with basic camping interior. We are selling due to a recent addition to our family which is restricting the use that we are getting out of her. She is currently in dry storage and is being driven out at least once a week to keep the engine ticking over and fresh. She's a Swedish import and joined the UK a little over 10 years and has always been kept in garages/ storage units. She's a LHD and a good little runner, pretty nippy considering her age and has solenoid doors. \n<br>MOT expires end of February 2016, with only one minor advisory from the previous test. She has recently had a new engine, alternator, clutch and steering tightened. Body work is sound with some minor surface rust that will need attention at some point in the future. She has full width rear facing bench and a full width pull out bench to form a bed. Black and grey interior with grey carpet and vinyl sides. The interior is pretty basic and may require some tlc to meet your tastes, however, we quite like the rough and ready look! \n<br>Please email for more information or pictures. \n<br>\n<br>thanks \n<br>£15000ono \n<br>07792111342\n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:Elb.broadhurst@gmail.com\">Elb.broadhurst@gmail.com</a>\n<!-- e -->",
