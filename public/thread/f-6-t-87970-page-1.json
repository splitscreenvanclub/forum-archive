(not good) the Folksy adjusters have bin around for years and things have moved on since then!! You really need two CE adjusters top'n'bottom to keep the T bars on equal pressure, torsion bars also have a tendancy to sag over the years so that might not be helping in the equasion! But if things are bouncing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> as you say they are it sounds like the shocks are \"mullered\" and for peace of mind I would just replace them and then you will know they are ok!! Looking at your pickkies you are running pretty low and with all your camping gear and probably two adults up-front things would start to bottom out especially on the roads in Wales ( we live here), hope this helps................ \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_king.gif\" width=\"21\" height=\"22\" alt=\":king:\" title=\"king\">",

For example if theres 3 of us riding up front I will firm them up a couple of clicks, works for me...\n<br> \n<br> With just the foksy adjuster that is as low as I would comfortably go, to get that extra couple of cm to me would require a different approach (adjuster on both beams, dropped spindles etc).
