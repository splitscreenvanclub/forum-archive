One of my flying spur straps was missing. Dave made an exact copy replacement. The tank slides in position and the flying spur arm sits on the top of the tank and the arm hinges up. They are held together by a mickey mouse eared wing nut bolt.\n<br>The spout is unscrewed and then the tank slid in place and then screwed through the hole in the bulkhead into the tank...Not an easy thing to line up on my new tank with a fine thread.\n<br>\n<br>The Devon OG is a coarse thread.\n<br>The spout is missing on this tank on eBay..\n<br>\n<br>I have a cut down tank with a spout I tried to sell on here...\n<br>\n<br>The one I had made is a full sized copy with the early bolt down inspection cover.",
