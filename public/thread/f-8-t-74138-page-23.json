He would like the van to go to a good home, to someone who will keep it original &amp; standard, &amp; preferably to a SSVC member.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>The van is VW Velvet Green lower &amp; pale green top, with a white pop-top. My friend bought it in 1989 when it had covered 85000 miles. It has now covered 106000 miles. The van is 12 volt. The engine is a 1600 recon. twin port, which has covered 20000 miles. The van always passed its MOT first time, and, due to my friend’s ill health, it has not been MOTed since 04/05.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Body&nbsp;\n<br>The chassis &amp; underside looks solid. It was originally undersealed &amp; the underseal was kept flexible by numerous coats of Waxyoil over the years. The only panels that have been welded are the sill under the cargo doors &amp; the bottoms of the cargo doors. The bodywork looked near perfect 4 years ago, but surface rust has erupted since. This “surface rust” may need to be cut out &amp; may require some new panels for a professional restoration. The areas that are rusty are:&nbsp;\n<br>LHS headlight bottom&nbsp;\n<br>LHS front door bottom&nbsp;\n<br>LHS &amp; RHS quarter lights&nbsp;\n<br>Front gutter&nbsp;\n<br>Bottom of windscreens&nbsp;\n<br>All wheel arches need attention&nbsp;\n<br>LHS sill&nbsp;\n<br>Bottom of rear hatch door &amp; some of the surround&nbsp;\n<br>Both pop out windows&nbsp;\n<br>Battery tray &amp; corresponding corner on LHS&nbsp;\n<br>The only hole in the bodywork is on the RHS rear wheel arch, adjoining the sill.&nbsp;\n<br>The front doors will not open, probably due to seized locks&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Mechanics&nbsp;\n<br>Everything is original apart from the recon. engine.&nbsp;\n<br>The engine cannot be started as the starter motor does not work. The engine always used to start first time.&nbsp;\n<br>The 4th gear sometimes jumps out of gear when accelerating hard.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>Extras&nbsp;\n<br>The van comes complete with an awning in good condition.&nbsp;\n<br>The Devon conversion is all original &amp; complete&nbsp;\n<br>The pop-up roof is water tight.&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>This van is a wee gem. It deserves a good home.&nbsp;\n<br>It is very rare to find a 45 year old original vehicle with a low mileage &amp; mostly original metal &amp; mechanics.&nbsp;\n<br>The van is located 25 miles from Edinburgh.&nbsp;\n<br>Pics can be viewed at:&nbsp;",

He sourced a black Bosch 12v coil and mounted that horizontal on the engine long black out of the way. This allowed the CSP linkage to be midway down the tower each side...snd the cable run to be fairly straight. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060015_zps670af266.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060015_zps670af266.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060016_zps2951603b.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060016_zps2951603b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060017_zps53dca495.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060017_zps53dca495.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060018_zps8cd793df.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060018_zps8cd793df.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060019_zps02bcff99.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060019_zps02bcff99.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060020_zps1e2b38b3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060020_zps1e2b38b3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>As you will see the CSP weber linkage was lowered to the middle position to get the cable run to the operating line very neatly a straight pull.\n<br>The weber flap return springs are quite weak with such a long accelerator cable run on a bus...\n<br>Chico fitted a functional bracket and standard accelerator return spring on the LH carb.\n<br>I tried to buy some neat aftermarket springs with fingers which fit on the shafts only to find they are no longer available. I posted a thread on here and the samba.com and corresponded with the stockist who used to supply them only to get... Too expensive to make...No market...Did not sell when we had them. .\n<br>But strange they had sold out..\n<br>If I could find one I would get a company I did some work for in Redditch to make a batch!\n<br>Anyway in the end Matt made a pair of similar matching brackets and used standard external accelerator springs..\n<br>May not look too pretty but it works..\n<br>May wear the spindles. ..We will see.\n<br>I also fitted the return spring under the pedal after lots of puzzling about where it fits and fitted a karl_f throttle roller and an Empi braided accelerator cable..\n<br>The flaps close and I now like the accelerator pedal feel..\n<br>Matt used the cable and plug set and re run the cables tidied them up and enclosed them in some nice cable trunking. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/P2060021_zps40855b90.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/P2060021_zps40855b90.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>As he said all he did was pretty the engine up.\n<br>He builds and runs drag cars and his installs are amazing. .\n<br>He was impressed.",
