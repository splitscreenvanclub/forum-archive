    "content" : "I've been having starter motor problems on and off for a while now. After trying two old ones I've fitted a new Bosch starter but I'm still having issues so I'm wondering if the fault is elsewhere. Basically when the ignition key is turned the lights dim slightly but the starter usually doesn't turn. No click, nothing. However occasionally it decides to turn and start ok. \n<br> I've removed the starter and re-fitted, checked the connections are good and cleaned a dodgy earth strap. On first try it turned fine then after that nothing. \n<br> Could this be a fault in the ignition barrel? I've thought about shorting out the starter to isolate the ignition switch and see if that works.\n<br> Any ideas folks?",
