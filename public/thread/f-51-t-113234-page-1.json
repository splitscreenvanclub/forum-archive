When I stripped the bus to find the original paint I tried to remove all of the unnecessary filler; I preferred the exposed dents than inches of filler. I reduced the amount of filler around all the old repairs and tidied it up. There are dents around the bus, and the lower nose looks to have a fair bit of filler over the repairs; again I reduced the amount there, but didn't dig very deep. Bottom of the inner arches are crusty. Bottom of the doors are crusty. Drops a little oil from the gearbox and engine but not loads. \n<br>\n<br>During my ownership of the van I have tried to improve the bus with every job I've done; either aesthetically or in function. It has had a great deal of time and money spent in the process. \n<br>\n<br>Based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/t31.0-8/12195093_10156145544105175_5133812198446850367_o.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/t31.0-8/12191383_10156145542420175_5846712832157304952_o.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
