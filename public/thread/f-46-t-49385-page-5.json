    "content" : "I'm sure this topic was covered on a previous thread. The Devon caravette badge was only fitted to Devon Caravette's, a bit of campsite snobery to show you spent the extra bit of money and bought a Caravette and not the cheaper Devonette. As to where it is fitted; Either of the Cargo doors had them, it all depended on the lockers fitted to the doors. My 64 didn't have the Wash Cupboard fitted so the Badge is on the left hand Cargo Door. I you think of it logically why would they take of a trim panel just to fit the Badge when they allready had a Cargo Door stripped down to fit the woodwork for mounting the Cupboard. I also have the small Devon Badge on the inside of the passenger Cab Door and if you had a Martin Walker elevating roof there would be a Martin Walker badge on the inside of the passenger Cab Door. I have owned my Devon Caravette for nearly 25 years and spent a great deal of time over the years researching and photographing Devon's to make sure mine was correct when I restored it.",
