It'll also weld an RSJ with a good fillet and multiple passes!\n<br>\n<br>I've had several welders over the years at home (used to be a coded welder, so got to play with some nice kit at work!), and I can't see me buying another one now. It's the most expensive home set I've bought, but for a reason - superb bit of kit. It's made by the same people that make Oxford welders, and is in fact a rebadged version of their sets. \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"https://www.weldequip.com/portamig-mig-welders.htm\">https://www.weldequip.com/portamig-mig-welders.htm</a>\n<!-- m -->",
