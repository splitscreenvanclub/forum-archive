    "content" : "Hey folks\n<br> \n<br> I have a really weird problem with my rear hatch lock. I've refitted the barrel into the push button and fitted the button mechanism and the latch, but the button isn't activating the latch. Looking at it from the inside, it seems to be too short! I'm certain that its the same barrel as before, but when you push the button in, it's not reaching the latch trigger.\n<br> \n<br> Any ideas? When the button is pressed in I assume that its just meant to push against the trigger?\n<br> \n<br> Here's the barrel with the button in the 'out' position.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/UK_Monkey/IMAG0628_zpstsjmmoes.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Here's the barrel with the button in the 'in' position. As you can see it doesn't go in far enough to push the latch trigger. Really odd.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k604/UK_Monkey/IMAG0630_zpsproddpna.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> Your thoughts and opinions please?",
