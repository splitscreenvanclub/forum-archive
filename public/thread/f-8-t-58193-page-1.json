    "content" : "Nearly finished my 66 0g paint Westy, i have had this for two yrs and finally got round to sorting it.The bus originated from Oregon it last turned a wheel in 83. The bus took three days to mop and polish and i think the time shows in the results.\n<br> Welding was not too involved it needed cargo floor quarter in from the doors and one outer sill on this side, paint was the carefully blended to match.\n<br> Westy camping kit is all there and in great shape although i did replace the cargo door panels with original spec 3mm birch ply and aged them to match.\n<br> Dropped the front with one adjuster on the beam and dropped spindels, straight axel in the rear connected to 1776 which pulls like a train.\n<br> Still need to locate set of og paint correct bumpers.\n<br> \n<br> BEFORE\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/376428.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/376429.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> AFTER\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01456.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01461.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01460.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01459.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01492.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01500.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i422.photobucket.com/albums/pp308/jono87/DSC01503.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

I dont find them too offensive, but i know i will end up taking the doors off and getting the pins pressed out.",
