    "content" : "Good morning all. 1967 Split Screen van, basically stock and is remaining that way (just a few changes, like 1600 barrels and pistons to be fitted as 1500 ones hard to get!). \n<br> We decided to go back to oil bath air filter rather than the pancake ones I've been using since about 2003. When I looked at the spares in my garage it appears that the one I have is for an earlier van (Steve had so many odd spares!) so does not fit. Please can I ask if anyone has or knows someone that has the correct one for my van? please",
