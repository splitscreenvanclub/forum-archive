    "content" : "Paul - have been thinking about some of the good times I've had in the van and that brought me back to the day we bought it from you. Then I found the picture I took of it on your drive \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\"> The test drive was the first time I'd driven a split! I remember the elastic band used to keep it in fourth. I've IRSed it since then so thankfully the band is no longer needed - although I expect it's in the lock-up somewhere. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1243.photobucket.com/user/edwardtoogood/media/Berth%20on%20day%20of%20purchase_zpsqfiogisa.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg549/edwardtoogood/Berth%20on%20day%20of%20purchase_zpsqfiogisa.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>A few years later we used the van for our wedding day.

    "content" : "Great pics Edd, the bus didn't look too bad when I sold it you and as it was already painted when I bought it you never quite know how good the bodywork is unless you decide to do a full resto like you did. This was the 1st splitty I had owned and I was also quite green when it came to working on them. Now I wouldn't have put up with the 4th gear jumping out and would have exchanged the gearbox. I can now rebuild an engine and remove one on my own in 40 mins. Since I sold you the bus, other than bodywork, I don't think there is anything mechanical that I haven't done myself. John's cracking with the welding on my new bus and It should be finished soon and ready for paint. I am using a local company in Macclesfield who have resprayed a bus for me in the past. Fingers crossed it should be on the road by the end of March and hopefully look like the bus in the last picture \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=12128&amp;sid=a87973553e35e3b0effca58cfc3c64e7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=12128&amp;t=1&amp;sid=a87973553e35e3b0effca58cfc3c64e7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpeg\" title=\"image.jpeg (93.89 KiB) Viewed 354 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=12127&amp;sid=a87973553e35e3b0effca58cfc3c64e7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=12127&amp;t=1&amp;sid=a87973553e35e3b0effca58cfc3c64e7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpeg\" title=\"image.jpeg (81.76 KiB) Viewed 354 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=12126&amp;sid=a87973553e35e3b0effca58cfc3c64e7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpeg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   image.jpeg (64.14 KiB) Viewed 354 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div>",

    "content" : "So after a bit of to'ing anf fro'ing I decided on the edging strip for my cargo door. It's an aluminium strip that I picked up in B&amp;Q, but it's a perfectly snug fit to go over the edge of my insulation + 9mm ply + vynol floor, which totals about 12mm. I reckon the width will be good to prevent any damage to the flooring from muddy boots etc. Sorry the picture is a it rubbish. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1243.photobucket.com/user/edwardtoogood/media/4ADCF62E-EDCD-48F4-BDEA-F0F6EA31F705_zpsybzt6fa0.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1243.photobucket.com/albums/gg549/edwardtoogood/4ADCF62E-EDCD-48F4-BDEA-F0F6EA31F705_zpsybzt6fa0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
