    "content" : "Heres my Split. I bought it from FBI around 4 years ago stripped the paint off it and didnt do much else on it.\n<br>\n<br> It was in pretty bad condition and needed the lower 6inches, mid chassis, floors ect. I wasnt going to buy it, but FBI dropped the price so i went to \"have a look\" in the knowlege that i A: have no money B: already own several rusty vws and C: it was 50/50 that my bug would even make it to Swansea from Cardiff.\n<br> Well the bug made it and worse still I bought it after seeing all that fresh air when the sunroof slid back!\n<br>\n<br>Anyways the plan is to get it back to military stock and make it look like it hasnt been restored. A good mate of mine Dai the Barndoor (Streetwagens on here) has the 53 swedish army bus and im hoping it will look equally as nails \n<br>\n<br>3 years ago after the first strip down \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/IMGP0067.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Having the chassis done at bbbcvw workshop\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/DSCF0425.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/DSCF0424.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>repairing the floor\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/002-6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/003-9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/005-9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/007-4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>the rear bed had holes hacked in it so a T25 engine hatch for better access to the engine area\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/002-8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/005-12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/008-6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Front repair\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/002-12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/005-14.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/007-9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/007-10.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>now the weird part! working from old photos of the van im replacing the dents ive lost by cutting the rust out of the van\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/004-14.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>cab floors and steps\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/010-4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/009-9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n278/wisejim/008-9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>took these a few weeks back.
