I've only just got the van, and have little history on the interior, but know that it's been made from pieces of a Devon interior, the main part being the cooker cupboard. It was a transporter originally.\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote class=\"uncited\">\n <div>\n  Appropriate hing looks like a dog bone hinged along the length I think...

The van is a '57, but thought the unit was more sixties? \n<br>It also looked like the hinge was riveted into the black top, but screwed into the wooden frame? \n<br>\n<br>Thanks for the tip with Caravan Supplies. I will check them out.",
