    "content" : "Splitbus Nation is a bi-annual event in Wachtebeke (Belgium) for Volkswagen split screen vans. Last edition in 2014 there were about 113 buses and we expect more for next years show in 2016. The fifth edition will be held next summer on July 29, 30 and 31.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.splitbusnation.be/index.php/en\">http://www.splitbusnation.be/index.php/en</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>We took at trip over to this show in 2014 and loved it, it's a real family event and even though it is small the atmosphere was fantastic and we can't wait to head back over next summer \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>The event as the name might suggest is based around Splitscreen buses but everyone is welcome, although the main show event on the Sunday is a display/show of Splitscreen buses only. All other vehicle's have to park in the main parking area just over the way. It is held at a proper camp site so you get proper facilities to use which makes a nice change from most shows I have attended over the years, this does mean though that you have to camp properly and not 'home is where you park it' style like most other shows.\n<br>\n<br>Take a look at the link above for more information, they will slowly add more and more as time gets closer and they get more things booked and confirmed.",
