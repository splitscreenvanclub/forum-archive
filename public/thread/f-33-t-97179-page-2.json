I in turn paid a fairly high price tag for my latest bus. They're worth what someone is willing to pay, but as said previously there are buses that have been for sale for 12 months and haven't dropped their asking price which seems rediculous considering they're asking £60k+\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Your bus was the one I let get away thinking about it, if something like it comes up again ill just go for it!

If you have a VW that is desirable then like everything else in this world you can expect to pay a premium. What I detest seeing is something that has the generic \"rare\" term used and an extra £5-10k on the price ticket.\n<br>\n<br>All our vans are rare, just some more so than others and some more desirable than others.\n<br>\n<br>Dr. G \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
