    "content" : "Hi all\n<br>\n<br>I have recently purchased the 65 Canterbury Pitt Splittie that was advertised on here by elevenreds, a very nice chap indeed.\n<br>\n<br>It needs a serious resto, but the previous owner has sourced most of the panels needed and various other bits. What attracted me to the bus was the fact that it has a complete original interior and a pop top with two bunks. I have 4 children including one month old twin boys!\n<br>My history with busses is an early bay and then I had a minter of an so42 that I loved. My other half made me sell it to get our current bus because it had no beds in the roof. I currently have a 74 bay with a big 2.4 type 4 engine with porche cooling, cog box gearbox, serious camping interior etc..it's a lovely thing but I has never done it for me so that is now up for sale.\n<br>\n<br>My plans for this bus is to restore to smart solid condition, but not a show winner, as we are keen campers. It needs extensive chassis and floor work, a short side ( autocraft panel supplied) lower nose and nose inners, and other work.. I'm a builder by trade and have done some resto work before but not on this scale so I'm nervous and excited at the same time. First stage is to get the entire underside blasted to see what's left, plus some other localised blasting on the body away from the long panels. I'm drawing all my inspiration and knowledge from the many excellent threads on this forum\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, some piccies...... These are of the van as found\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/79BA5167-CE4E-4EED-85BC-C96C5265A6C1-766-0000015C7ADC560F.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/06F0E5BB-57E7-4DBF-BB15-00184CFA044C-766-0000015C80F7CD55.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>So we loaded her on the trailor and filled my t5 up with all the bits \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/099A8383-26BB-4B31-9252-2F12B957C1B1-766-0000015C87577A93.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/75CB68CA-DB97-4D7C-AAB6-28B24EAA7591-766-0000015C8D96C984.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/EE408BF4-32D6-48CB-B664-6F20C81BC306-766-0000015C93ECB4EC.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We then set off home\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/30B14BA1-56E9-4B28-9ECB-5A6807808A57-766-0000015C99C0816C.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>And finally arrived home\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/97f807afaa608c443029869ba89fbb03.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/b79a22f81f770b143942de55be4ca4a0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/33a72b8e2b28c1e82c213af70ff444da.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1115.photobucket.com/albums/k557/JonthebuilderJongrobertson/914f8d8ad850fd0cfad3885be5795bdc.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So there we are.
