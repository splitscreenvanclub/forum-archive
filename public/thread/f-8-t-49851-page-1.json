I received an email from a previous owner of my bus!!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> Here are a few details from the email:\n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"color:#0080BF\">Hello Dai!<br> I have seen your bus here and there on the net and I believed it has to be the one I had in the mid 90s. And it was! <br> Unfortunately I haven´t many photos but I scanned them and will send them to You in separate mail.<br> The first owner was Vägförvaltningen i Västernorrlands län, Härnösand. It´s a department for road maintainance and in the fifties they used to have army green<br> veichles. The car was scrapped in 1961 and went to a junkyard in Härnösand. Mr Nordstrand, a neighbour to the junkyard owner bought the bus because He, like<br> many other farmers in the district used old buses as a cabin for hunting and when he worked with timber. When I found the bus it was converted to a very interesting <br> tractor pulled sled. The brake drums were welded to the back plates and rims from a Popular had steel beams welded like a ski. I suppose You have noticed the<br> traces of welding on the brakes? The bus was a nightmare to move and would be in better use as a anchor for a battleship. I paid Mr Nordstrand 30 euro and towed<br> it to My garage. In these years there was barndoors almost everywhere and I didn´t pay too much attention to this one. You could find better ones for little money.To be honest I didn´t care much about how old a bus was either, as long it was a split screen. The year after I found a 23-window and put the bd out for sale. Not so many interested...the only thing happened was that someone stole the taillights when He was allowed to look at the bus when I was at work <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-(\" title=\"Sad\"> Two months later Mats called<br> Me and we made a deal, I traded the bus for 8 skylight windows, corner windows and the sunroof which was missing on My deluxe. I delivered it to his garage and that´s<br> the end of my story. Anyway, I am happy over to see Y19726 back on the road again. It looks absolutely fantastic, great job! By the way, I suppose<br> You know the \"Kempes\" bd? It was rescued about 10 miles from the place I found Your bus. I didn´t know about it at all, even though I´ve been everywhere around here<br> looking for split screens. I failed to scan an old licence register from 1958 I have where all veichle in the county was registered, that´s the blurry pic I sent to You. Your bus is registered on that page. The Kempes bd is there too. <br> I hope that You could read and understand this properly, I´m a Swede You know <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\"> And by the way, if we meet sometimes...Could I have a ride in Your bus?<br> Bye for now and Good night!/ Arne</span>\n<br> \n<br> Fabulous!!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I had heard about the 30 Euro price before, that was when it worked out at approx £16 due to the exchange rate, but it is excellent to hear the info directly!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> I shall host these pics and get them on this thread!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
