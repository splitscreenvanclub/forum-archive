Frustrating really when you use and like a site so much which could be so much more with a small amount of effort. I'm guessing the site isn't being backed up either so next crash how much will be lost again? Not trying to be an arse or have attitude, but I know I can help and I also know the help won't be taken as I would have the same trust issues with my own site.",
