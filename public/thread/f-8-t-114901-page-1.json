    "content" : "Hi guys this is my first split after lots of bays. We have wanted one for a long time and when we seen this come up recently we knew it was the one for us . \n<br> It has everything we would have wanted , it's RHD , solid , narrowed with full air ride, Paris ragtop , sprintstars , R&amp;R bed , factory walk through , straight axled rear and taller gearbox , Bluetooth soundsystem , creative safaris and buttys seals etc . It drove great the whole way home from Birmingham back to Northern Ireland . We even got to spend our first night in it as we missed the boat and had to sleep at the port for 6hrs lol. \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=13224&amp;sid=b868942992b051672b62473250fb1e33&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=13224&amp;t=1&amp;sid=b868942992b051672b62473250fb1e33\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpeg\" title=\"image.jpeg (974.98 KiB) Viewed 327 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
