    "content" : "Does your 67 have the later larger DIN sized radio aperture?\n<br> Blaupunkt made radios to that new standard. I believe these listed Radios were all transistor and more compact than the earlier ones with a seperate power pack based on valves. \n<br> If a US LHD bus you could examine thesamba.com threads for US aftermarket radios.\n<br> \n<br> First search the Forum in the \"For sale\" threads from Rich Oakley. He sells Blaupunkts of all ages. Some as fitted by VW with VW knobs/ logos.",
