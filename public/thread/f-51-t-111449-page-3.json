I myself have shipped in a fair few from USA and Brazil. I had to comment on this add because Iv seen buses in this type of condition many times and could of picked them up for peanuts.....However didn't bother because I knew how much money and time it would cost to try an straighten them out. You need to look at theses buses in the flesh before buying. I hope you're new venture goes well because searching finding and importing buses is a great business especially when you have happy customers. However your description wasn't great, the bus...well pictures speak for themselves and the price.....No idea where that figure came from? Maybe because it's right hand drive....but I wouldn't want to insult you with what I think it's worth. When searching for buses to import there's keepers and leavers get this right and hopefully we may see some nice buses from you. I wish Good luck with your new business but you need to re evaluate this add. I don't mean to troll as people call it but this add shocked me!",
