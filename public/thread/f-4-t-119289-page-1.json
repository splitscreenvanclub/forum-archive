    "content" : "Hi - per my PM with collino just now please assume this is the cheaper repro available at Heritage for £158 which according to their description\n<br> \n<br> Description:\n<br> \n<br> Fuel tank with a fixed fuel filler neck. Please note the tank has a hole for fuel sender, if the vehicle has no fuel gauge you will need to use a blanking plate.\n<br> \n<br> Quality:\n<br> \n<br> Reproduction\n<br> \n<br> Fitting:\n<br> \n<br> The fuel filler neck isn't welded to the tank in the correct place, it will require bending or cutting and re-welding to fit. The tank uses a 60mm fuel cap\n<br> \n<br> Hopefully I am OK to copy this from their site - if not I am sure I will soon find out.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Mark",
