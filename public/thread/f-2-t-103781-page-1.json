    "content" : "Given that the element is working I think your next step is to 'burp' it. This is where you simply turn it upside down and back again a couple of times. On older fridges this re-combines the ammonia and the other liquid whose name I can't remember. Perhaps more likely is the refrigerant could be condensed and sitting in the condenser chamber and again, burping it should encourage it to settle back down in the evaporator.\n<br>\n<br>If that doesn't work then check the pipework for signs yellowy/green powder. If you find some then the ammonia has more than likely leaked out and the thing is most likely a write-off.",
