    "content" : "Hi \n<br>New to the site and to be fair VW ownership so thought this would be a good place to start, although to be fair I have been in email contact with a couple of members re their vans.\n<br>So, I'm looking for a split screen camper - not a project - not molested mechanically (lowered/non-VW engined/other 'trick' additions). I don't mind a bit of work to get it to what I actually want (specifically interior), I guess something that can be used as is with a view to changing over time. Major bodywork is a no go as well.\n<br>I am also a 'bit fussy' about the colour too, so green (any shade) is a definite no-no, as is any 'natural patina'.\n<br>These are the things I would consider purchasing to make life a little more comfortable if not already fitted/coming with van - awning, hook-up, split charger, auxillary heating and a decent protective cover; I mention these as I have to include them in my overall budget.\n<br>Now to the crunch statement - I have a budget of Â£25,000 to hopefully set me an the missus up for our retirement cruises!\n<br>All help/advice/comments/suggestions/constructive criticism or leads to a suitable van greatly appreciated.\n<br>We're based in Essex so I need to take distance into consideration when planning viewings.\n<br>Thanks in anticipation \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
