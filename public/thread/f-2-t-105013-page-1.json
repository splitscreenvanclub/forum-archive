    "content" : "Hi Guys,\n<br>\n<br>I've not been on here for a while as i sold my splitty back in 2010 so feel a bit bad coming to you cap in hand.\n<br>\n<br>I run Teddy Bear Run with a close friend of mine and we put on automotive events to raise funds for children's charities. Recently i have been working with the Chestnut Tree House Children's Hospice that look after children and young adults with life limiting illnesses. Every year we put on a cruise where we deliver Teddy Bears to the Hospice for the children but also raise money by charging an entry fee and also look for corporate sponsorship. More recently i was contacted by Chestnut as they had a little 4 year old boy who has a very rare condition in that he was born without a functioning digestive system. He had his 4th birthday recently and was gutted that no one bought him a real Lamborghini. We managed to find one and took it down for him and his brothers to sit in, have photos taken and a very slow drive around the yard (in the passenger seat).\n<br>\n<br>Chestnut have contacted me again to see if i know anyone with a VW Camper that would be able to take a young girl to her prom in June 2015. It's a bit far in advance i know but figured i would get in early and see if there is anyone in the area willing to help that i can contact closer to the time. The reason a camper is required is that the girl has a spinal condition and is confined to a motorised wheelchair. They have a ramp to be able to get the chair into a vehicle.\n<br>\n<br> Any questions please ask away.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks,\n<br>\n<br>John.",

Only reason for asking as a lot of camper interiors are quite restrictive by the side doors, I know mine is... Just a thought, hate for you to have an offer of a camper that you cant actually use on the day...",

Inside I have enough room for the chair to be facing forwards inside the side doors.\n<br>My only slight issues will be that I have no way of securing the chair in place other than any brakes on the chair itself. Also there may be an issue with transporting the ramps to the venue for unloading unless they are pretty compact and would fit in the rear load are through the tailgate.\n<br>Your thoughts?",
