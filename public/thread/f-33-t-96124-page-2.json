All they need to do is give their customers an honest \"heads up\" on what's happening instead of leaving people in the dark or, even worse, telling porkies. At least then they will be able to manage their customers expectations and allow us to manage time frames etc. Most other suppliers seem to be able to do it.\n<br> Still, the missing bits are allegedly in transit (although I was told \"a couple of weeks\" in January) so I should be bouncing along for this years AGM.......or not, as my Bus is on axle stands and has been since the 5th of Jan!
