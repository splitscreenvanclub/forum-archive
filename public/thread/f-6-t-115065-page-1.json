    "content" : "Hello SSVC\n<br>\n<br>Any help on a vehicle is very much appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>I found a LHD Bus that is in a \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">very bad </span>way in the UK, but am trying to find out approx model and year.\n<br>\n<br>It has been sitting for decades and was red bottom and white top. It's a Deluxe with Jail Bars inside.\n<br>\n<br>The only information that I have worked out is it's high hinge, and 4 windows on the side panel.\n<br>\n<br>I therefore am guessing it's a 15 window pre 1960 due to the hinges on cargo doors and also that the roof has collapsed so it probably had corner windows, and also because it's LHD and been sitting for so many decades?\n<br>\n<br>I'm going for another look soon and any help in what to look for is appreciated if it might be a barndoor. \n<br>\n<br>I can not get access to the front or back, but a wheel is visible, what size should I look for?\n<br>\n<br>Unfortunately time is an issue as the thing will be crushed very soon if not rescued.\n<br>\n<br>It has solid bulkhead and has ali handle and jail bars, cross stitched black trim for the bulkhead divider from back to front, and grey material for long jail bar trim.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks, any help is great.

If it's not been touched for decades there's a chance they haven't been repainted and a date might be visible. That will give you a guide at least?\n<br>\n<br>Barndoor wheels are 16\" and after that 15\" until 64-ish.\n<br>\n<br>If you can see inside and there are coat hooks and a clock on the dash below the passenger side grab handle then its a deluxe, and with it being high hinge a 15w or 23w samba.\n<br>\n<br>Worse case - it could be a later Brazilian or South African Fleetline(?) as I believe these too came with high hinge doors, although happy to stand corrected.\n<br>\n<br>Post a pic and people can spot all sorts of things which will identify the year.\n<br>\n<br>Good luck,\n<br>\n<br>Nige",
