    "content" : "To all you bus lovers,\n<br>\n<br>This is my first thread on SSVC, 2nd, if you count my post in a few months back where I was asking a few tips of how to go about my restoration.\n<br>\n<br>I've been the proud owner of a 1958 Splitty since last September 2014, but let me give you a little background before I start off this thread.\n<br> \n<br>I live in a small island called Malta, if you have got a map... it's that little microscopic dot under Sicily! My dad has owned his 1969 VW Beetle for most of my life, so you can definitely say that it was his enthusiasm and dedication that started me on the road to VW obsessions. I always adored the classic hippy bus and longed to own one one day, thanks to my dad's 2nd restoration 3 years ago I started looking both locally and also through UK websites to see what splitty's the world offered. After almost losing hope finally found one locally. The owner has just just sandblasted her 1958 Splitscreen for a full restoration, but due to other obligations, the van stayed in that condition until it was finally up for sale. When I first saw the bus I knew it needed a lot of work (which almost put me off at first) but then I realised that the restoration is part of the fun and pride of owning these types of vehicles. Therefore to cut the long story short, I went and bought that bus in September 2014.\n<br>\n<br>So, I'd like to introduce to you, my '58:\n<br>\n<br>- Transporting her from where she was stored to her new garage.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/james_abela91/media/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/24_zps31180a09.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k621/james_abela91/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/24_zps31180a09.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>- As you can clearly see she was a panel van that was poorly converted to a 15 window by one of her previous owners a long time ago.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/james_abela91/media/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/28_zps3584a111.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k621/james_abela91/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/28_zps3584a111.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>- Finally in her new garage.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1119.photobucket.com/user/james_abela91/media/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/211_zpsbc014cc1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k621/james_abela91/My%201958%20VW%20Splitscreen/211_zpsbc014cc1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And from there a story started to unfold.\n<br>\n<br>I will continue to update this thread with progress updates and of course, tons of photos!!\n<br>\n<br>James, Over &amp; Out.",

I was determined to get it right.\n<br>\n<br>Here are some pictures of the window cut outs, as they were when I originally bought it.

So I went over for a chat to see if he would take up this restoration as I have never welded or such before, and I wanted the best for my splitty.
