    "content" : "hi guys\n<br>\n<br>the bus is having an engine transplant this winter as ive had enough of the type 4 fuel consumption! just gathering parts at the moment and need a bit of advice, ive got the engine sorted a 1z fly by wire, ive wired plenty of these up so no problems there, gearbox is going to bears to have ratio's changed etc, adaptor plate on its way from kenedy, but are unsure which radiators people are using for water cooled conversions etc and where they are being mounted and air fed to them??? i know theres a couple of tdi splits on here and would be gratefull if they could shed some light on this\n<br>\n<br>alex",
