    "content" : "Hi All \n<br>\n<br>We thought we would share my excitment with you after our Drugs Bus passed its MOT yesterday. He has been 2 years in the making and god knows how may years off the road. We have attached some pictures for you all to check out and we would be grateful to know what you think. \n<br>\n<br>If anyone of you knows anything about Owl Rexell or Levinson's in Bel Aire shopping Center, Napa (which is the equivallent to boots in the UK) we love to hear from you. \n<br>\n<br>It was hillarious when we turned up at the MOT station, we had him trailored as he has not been registered in the UK yet and when we turned up at the garage, the MOT tester was less than impressed (we are sure that he took one look at the drugs bus and thought instant fail) however, when he got it up on the ramps, it was a totally different story - take a look and let us know what you think. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Thank you \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC01543.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC01552.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC01553.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04088-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04089.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC01548.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04090.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC01558.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC02459.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC02602.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC03290.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC03291.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC03292.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC03410.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC03411.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04045.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04052.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04053.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04093.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04199.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04205.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i386.photobucket.com/albums/oo308/dogbling/Drugs%20Bus/DSC04209.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
