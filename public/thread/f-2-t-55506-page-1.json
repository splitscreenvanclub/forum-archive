They are looking for a clean and tidy bus for the background, so no rat looks I am afraid.\n<br>\n<br>If you are interested, if you can e-mail me photos to \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:presland_presland@hotmail.com\">presland_presland@hotmail.com</a>\n<!-- e --> with your contact details and I will pass on to them on a first dibs basis.\n<br>\n<br>David",
