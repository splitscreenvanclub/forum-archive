    "content" : "Appreciate any help with this one...\n<br> \n<br> I have recently acquired a 61 split project - much of the hard work is done including a CE IRS conversion. One of my jobs is to connect up the gear linkage. I've got the long rear gear linkage rod in but just discovered that the gearbox connection is out of line with the gear linkage tube. The gearbox looks to be about 10-12mm too high at the connecting end. At the moment I have no idea whether its just tilted up at that end or too high all round. Does that matter as long as I can get the gear linkage connected?\n<br> \n<br> I'm sort of assuming that I'll just have to modify the gearbox mountings until its all in line, but has anyone come across this problem before and got any tips?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance...",

    "content" : "If you have a standard Beetle gearbox with its nosecone then it won't line up. You need to fit a split one, which is a case of taking the old one off your split and fitting it.\n<br> \n<br> Sounds like you don't have the OG one though, which means that you need to get a used split one or aftermarket.\n<br> \n<br> CIP1 in the states do one, which has the benefit of having a hole in it so that you can fit a reversing light switch. Worth having !\n<br> \n<br> OG split ones generally don't have the reversing light hole.\n<br> \n<br> The gearbox needs to be correctly lined up other wise the engine won't sit straight.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Jonny",
