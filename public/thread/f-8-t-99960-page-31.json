Have you got a build thread on here I can have a look at? Are you using the standard bottom mounts on the arms still? Ive seen a few guys put a beam across the top of the gearbox to mount them off, the issue is the movement as they dont move in a linear motion as you are aware, Im not sure how they address that? Uniball top mount??",

Loved the bus in your profile so if its similar then would be well up for reading that! \n<br>\n<br>Was originally planning to use 9\" split rim rears but that quickly halted as even with a narrowed rear torsion housing, mounting the bags outboard of the chassis rails was impossible, so it's on 7\"s now. \n<br>\n<br>Where do the tops line up to? Inside of the chassis or outside with your narrowed back end?",
