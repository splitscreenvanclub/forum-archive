Although maybe after the pandemic panic buying would be a good idea to buy! \n<br> Question is;\n<br> Would putting in a 3/4 pop up roof in a split screen put off anyone buying it in the future?\n<br> Just myself and 2 young sons (9 and 13) so want a bed in the roof.\n<br> Cheers",

    "content" : "I've got a 3/4 pop roof in my bus fitted by the previous owner. It was one of the reasons I bought it. I believe it was made by Space Roofs. I've got two girls 14 &amp; 12 and they sleep in the roof. There are good points and bad points to it.\n<br> \n<br> The Good:\n<br> \n<br> 1. Safe and secure for them\n<br> 2. Its a full width/ length bed and not bunks so plenty of room \n<br> 3. I can actually stand up in the bus\n<br> 4. Drive away awning rail fitted under the roof\n<br> 5. Don't need to pitch a separate tent.\n<br> 6. Gives much more feeling of space in the back.\n<br> 7. I have the hammock over the front seats too so technically my bus sleeps 5 (and two dogs on the floor).....cosy!\n<br> \n<br> The bad:\n<br> \n<br> 1. I have to move the boards around so they can get in and out (I think that may be my design as the Space supplied boards look easier to manage.\n<br> 2. It rocks... When the kids move the whole bus rocks on the tyres. Fixed by putting static caravan stands under the jacking points\n<br> 3. It adds weight. The boards are heavy and so is the fibreglass roof compared to the steel roof\n<br> 4. Securing straps are a bit fiddly to attach",
