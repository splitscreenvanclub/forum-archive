I'm guessing the way to fit these is to firstly weld the inner strengthener to the outer cargo sill and then weld that entire section into place in between the b and c post of course and into the inner sill?\n<br>I'm sure I've seen the inner strengthener already supplied welded to the outer sill but mine are separate. Just want to ensure I get the fitting order correct.\n<br>And prior to welding I guess this is the time to perfectly align the cargo door mechanism?\n<br>Thanks in advance.",
