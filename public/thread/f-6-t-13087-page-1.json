    "content" : "Excellent thread but confess I have no experience of either, I have till next spring to deliver a more reasonable cruising speed though hence my interest. I've just laid a tape measure against the wheel gearbox and it looks like 4 inches between axle and wheel centres, this is about the same as the clearance above the front tyre at its outside edge. If the front track was narrowed a bit there looks to be another inch. I dont know how much of this is suspension travel. So if go for straight axle does it follow that for a level van and neutral camber the front suspension has about an inch of travel at most? I think the ride is already harsh (not a critisism as is what I would expect for a one ton truck), surely x times stiffer is not an option for a family van? \n<br> \n<br>I havnt seen a reference to a freeway flier gearbox before is there more info somewhere?",
