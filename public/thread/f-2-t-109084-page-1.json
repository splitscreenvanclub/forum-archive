Theres 4 types of titles. blue clear title, salvage title, a bonded title, and I forgot a scrap title.. the scrap title is the easiest to get but not sure what you have to get one. I get mine out of Oklahoma because its a tiny bit easier and fast..mor expensive but hey faster works for me and its a clear title without a bond... which sucks.. you can ship with all 4 styles I think the scrap one is the only one I am not sure about. \n<br>If you need help I would be glad to help if I can.. I have exported over 600 vehicles mostly buses but some vettes porsches and now a few trucks and a lot of Americana (old bikes coolers and ....)",
