    "content" : "Hi, \n<br> \n<br>As i just been to start it up, thought i would take some shots of my actual bus, one i have had for 15 years now, its spent all its life with me outside(hadnt moved in 11 years when i got it from an irish gent in 91), apart from the last year inside that garage, has an interesting collection of moss, has caught fire several times, never gets washed and has had practically nothing spent on it for the last 10 years other than the odd bit to keep it running. The engine used 15 litres of oil on its last cornwall trip , the gearbox pops out of 4th and wines like nothing i have ever heard and last time i used it it had an electrical fire. The wiring loom is joined completely in 3 places and has some skoda wiring in it (yep i did that in about 92),Its moved house for me 4 times and has been all over the uk and france/ spain. \n<br>It was turbo charged for a while in 97, with the roughest home made turbo sytem ever, 1500 cc turbo, was interesting, but used soo much oil that didnt last long. Also had hydralics for a few years... \n<br>Its got a type 3 case,standard inside, 1600 with a weber twin carb and some old 041 heads (are these still available - never hear of them now), with the low profiles on the front can push itself way off the clock, but you can only do that for a short period of time as it looses all its oil \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>It won rust and prime at santa pod in 96 (blue on top, same as pop out colour , white on the bottom if anyone remembers it)and has had more parties in than i care to remember, it never doesnt make it home and hasnt run for a year as i havnt had any where to keep it, but im driving it to scotland next week after some repairs, wiring patch up and hopefully an mot \n<br>Not going to be thread i will add to because as long as i own it, which will be as long as i live it wont get restored........... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">, but is having some new rings( on the Â£10 2nd hand pistons i put in about 10 years ago, yep i really dont spend money on this, and a low milage gearbox which im shoving in this weekend as i dont think the other ones going to survive ... \n<br> \n<br>SO just for fun, the non project 65, where the pics make it look alot better than it actually is \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00035.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>thats a bvf 94 sticker in the window \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00037.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00042.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>Its a torvette devon \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00041.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00033.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00039.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>The old hydraulic switch on the dash cover \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC00043.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>Mark",
