    "content" : "Hi, my split screen is a very long term project, however my biggest worry (as I can replace most parts) is corrosion in the front roof pillars. Has anyone replaced these and how did you do it? I'm confident I can make most parts but I know pillars can be complex. Thanks in advance.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

See my thread on how bad it was...\n<br>I replaced the whole roof and searched for a cut..of A post...\n<br>I passed up buying a pair that Graham Clarke had at fbi and did not buy them....big mistake..\n<br>I bought a couple of sections of A pillar and have used cuts from these to patch areas of my OS A post and seal edges.\n<br>I bought a complete assembly from klassicfab. ..expensive but good direct from Colombia via an argument with Gerson himself. \n<br>I know Autocraft sell sections of the inner A panel..\n<br>I am still missing the outer skin around the windscreen but will have to have this bit fabricated",

    "content" : "Hi there,\n<br>I am just after replacing the A pillars on both sides. It can be difficult to get right even with the hole front to the bus off. I guess it all depends on how much you have your bus stripped down. I used the KlassicFab pillars which were good. I had the roof braced before starting but you need to make sure you have loads of measurements before starting. If you need some help/advice let me know. p.s I am a novice and have learned the hard way!",
