    "content" : "Every year I struggle to put into words what the OCD experience is like. It's like no other VW event. You can walk around VW shows looking at buses and say \"yeah, this is nice or that's nice\" but its nothing compared to being near the front of the convoy and looking in the mirrors to see near 30 buses rolling along, or being at the back and seeing so many buses snaking through the Devon countryside. Nothing else feels like OCD. It's an emotional thing....it's brilliant!\n<br> Thank you to everyone involved at all levels for making it so special. Thank you Bob ( BO JANGLES) and girls for marshalling, and John (JK) for being the parking attendant of the day.\n<br> Thank you too the fellow convoyers for making it the social event it is.\n<br> It was great to see the old faces and good to meet the new ones.\n<br> \n<br> BUZZ and MAZ, thank you seems so inadequate but its all I have.....so THANKYOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AND EFFORTS TO MAKE OCD SUCH A SPECIAL AND UNIQUE EVENT.\n<br> \n<br> Nige and Jo",
