I have read the reviews and it seems that the site maybe has gone downhill a little.Past reviews sound really good,A lot of positives but the last year or so there seems to be a couple of indifferent reviews.I'm looking at traveling up there this summer. Cool camping rave about the site but i think their review comes from trying the site out some years ago.",

    "content" : "We stayed a couple of times last year and really enjoyed it ,the site is located right next to the sea and based on location alone this site is very good but never seems over busy ,it has a pebble beach which is lovely to listen to waves crashing upon as the sea is very close, prices are good compared with other sites but increase a lot during high season, toilet shower facilities are basic but ok , there is a kitchen area set up for campers with washing machine etc, also an old barn with open fire and table that campers gather in for a few beers if the weather is rubbish. its a very likeable traditional no thrills site with logs delivered each night by the owner for your open camp fire ,the track down has to be driven very carefully if your van is lowered, mine is and I took a couple of wooden ramps on my 2nd visit as there is a bridge made of railway sleepers that's tricky.A few mile up the road is fairbourne and a walk across the railway side bridge your in Barmouth. Also well worth looking at is the blue lake behind fairbourne.",
