    "content" : "Hi, I’m busy with a rack and pinion steering conversion at the moment. I’ve mocked up the brackets and got most of it in position, but annoyingly the steering shaft runs right where one of the brake lines comes out of the master cylinder (see photo). Does anyone know why the master cylinders are made with inserts on the side where the brake lines come out? Is there anything wrong with blanking that side off and running the pipe off the switch side?\n<br> Cheers\n<br> Adrian",
