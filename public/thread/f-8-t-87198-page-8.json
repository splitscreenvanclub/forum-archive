It's been really hectic here at Empster mansions what with one thing and another. \n<br>So.......\n<br>Managed about 2 hours kip on the most uncomfortable camp bed in the world, would've been better off sleeping in one of the cars I. The depot to be honest \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>Hauled my craggy @rse up at stupid o clock and got the tube to St Pancras and settled down for the train ride.

In the rain.....\n<br>I felt more sorry for the ticket collector to be honest as every station it stopped at she had to get out and wave her flag and she didn't hVe a jacket or anything \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>Arrived at Worksop station bang on time and got picked up by the ever so helpful chaps from Red9Design in their bay window for the short drive to the workshop.
