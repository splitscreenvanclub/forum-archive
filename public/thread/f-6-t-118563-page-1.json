    "content" : "Hi\n<br> \n<br> As of late I am having issues starting my bus ('63 Westy). I am pretty sure it is to do with the ignition barrel &amp; key. Sometimes it is easy to start other times no matter how much I wiggle the key I can not get the final click with the key to start my bus. This has been getting progressively worse and I am now reluctant to take the bus out on fear of getting stranded.\n<br> I have purchased a new barrel &amp; keys, think they came from JK but Custom &amp; Commercial, Heritage etc all seem to sell the same product. I am after some advice if any of you have performed this swap with a new barrel supplied by one of the previously mentioned suppliers. \n<br> \n<br> (A) Does the barrel actually fit?\n<br> (B) what tools required?\n<br> (C) Any handy tips?\n<br> \n<br> I ask this as the bus is stored a few miles from my home address and I dont want to get caught without a tool or part.\n<br> \n<br> Hope some of the friendly folk on here can point me in the right direction.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers Johnny",

Firstly you don't need a new barrel - just the switch at the rear of the barrel. Just remove the whole barrel/switch unit (easy) and then take out the switch (one small screw) and replace. And yes - your steering lock will work if you do this. It probably won't if you replace the whole unit with the cheap repro unit.\n<br> HTH",
