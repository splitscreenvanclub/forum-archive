Kids had to be back to school Monday.. The seller who was a vicar said she was prepared to take a leap of faith with me.. signed the V5, gave me a receipt and let me take the Westy home and pay her on Monday!!! Which I did.. \n<br>\n<br>I would have never have put that kind of trust in anyone.. kind of sad really.. cool story to go with our van thou \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
