    "content" : "When I needed a new roof for the Karmann Ghia I ordered one from these people \n<a href=\"http://carhoodsdirect.co.uk/\" class=\"postlink\">http://carhoodsdirect.co.uk/</a>\n<br> \n<br> It was made to order in the States and took about 6 weeks if I remember it right. The quality and fit are fantastic, but they highly recommend the roof is fitted by a professional auto trimmer, but seeing as I was only replacing the outer skin and had the old one to take off and see where everything went I decided to fit it myself. It is possibly the most difficult job I have ever done on any VW. \n<br> \n<br> Maybe your best bet would be to contact trimmers local to you, find one that will do a roof, I spoke with Pete at Bromsgrove Auto Trim after I'd done mine and he told me he would avoid them if he could.\n<br> \n<br> You could also try \n<a href=\"http://carhoodfitters.co.uk/\" class=\"postlink\">http://carhoodfitters.co.uk/</a>.\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=34192&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=34192&amp;t=1&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"004.JPG\" title=\"004.JPG (134.44 KiB) Viewed 1115 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=34191&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=34191&amp;t=1&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"003.JPG\" title=\"003.JPG (136.77 KiB) Viewed 1115 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=34190&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=34190&amp;t=1&amp;sid=0783c79918bd890e152f48d438a6be40\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"002.JPG\" title=\"002.JPG (144.3 KiB) Viewed 1115 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
