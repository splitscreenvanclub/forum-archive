    "content" : "just thought I would post some stuff I have been doing to my bus recently\n<br>\n<br>I was running a Straight axle back end which compromised of...\n<br>long beetle tubes and axles, \n<br>one on one adaptor plates, \n<br>early bay CE adjustable spring plates\n<br>late beetle brakes with early wide 5 drums and butty's spacers\n<br>\n<br>-4\" narrowed front beam with compromised of…\n<br>home made narrowed beam with wagon west urethane bushes &amp; adjusters\n<br>VWgillybilly drop spindles\n<br>air dampers\n<br>\n<br>Wheels - standard bus 15\" steels \n<br>155/80/15 tyres on the rear (pretty narrow to clear the adjustable spring plate adjuster - without running spacers)\n<br>155/60/15 tyres up front\n<br>\n<br>I have been talking about going back to stock for a LONG time….enough talk\n<br>\n<br>how it was\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/stevemaddison/media/honorste/06052012027.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c68/stevemaddison/honorste/06052012027.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>First thing I decided, was although I do prefer the look of 15's, i would move back to the correct 14's\n<br>175/60/14's up front\n<br>175/80/14's on the rear (these required spacers to stop the tyres rubbing on the adjustable spring plates)\n<br>\n<br>\n<a

adjusters…but decided against it…basically the front end is now stock, with the exception of the drop spindles which i am still running\n<br>I also changed the front tyres \n<br>175/70/14C \n<br>\n<br>new standard width front end ….doesnt actually look that much different, obviously, the wheels stick out 2\" more each side, but ~i was getting bored of seeing every splitty with tucked in front wheels TBH\n<br>1st impression was…WOW…those 4\" of torsion leaves you chop off really make a BIG difference to the ride quality…drive lovely..very comfortable\n<br>\n<a

drove really nice and the gearing was really good\n<br>but….I thought the back end now looked too narrow compared to the front\n<br>so…\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>…..engine out, rear running gear off\n<br>(while it was all out, I also spent a week scraping back the crud over the gearbox, cradles, rear wheel arches etc..fresh coat of paint, stone chip and grey paint)\n<br>RB stock back end ready to go back in\n<br>\n<br>my nose cone was pretty knackered after years on bodges…the end where the bush sits was actually broken clean off…god knows how long its been like that LOL\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/stevemaddison/media/honorste/IMG_2415_zpsohrkvudz.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img

transporterhaus ones from cool air\n<br>but after waiting for 3 weeks (having been told they would be a couple of days) I cancelled the order and stuck stock spring plates on\n<br>I'm glad really, the adjustable ones would only have caused tyre clearance issues TBH\n<br>\n<br>all back together, the rear is obviously down a few splines to match the front for now, but as I don't have adjustable spring plates I can now run\n<br>185/14C rear tyres with issues\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s25.photobucket.com/user/stevemaddison/media/honorste/IMG_2474_zpsmikqqivr.jpg.html\"

lower…and another main reason for going back to stock would be to allow running more stockfish' tyres\n<br>\n<br>so…something from the back of the garage\n<br>\n<br>185/70/14 up front\n<br>195/75/14 on the rear (bit small..so just received some new whitebanded 185/14C - bargain £54 each delivered off Ebay)\n<br>\n<br>\n<a
