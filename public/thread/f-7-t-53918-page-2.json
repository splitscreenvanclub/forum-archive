Simple answer they sent back. NO. \n  <br>\n  <br>Try RAC Trakstar you can pay a one off subscription for the length of time you own the vehicle. Where as Trakker chearge you every 3 years!!!\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>I'm in discussion with Tracker at the moment about a group deal. So'll I'll start a new thread about that now.\n<br>\n<br>And the system they run is either you pay once for the life of your ownership of the vehicle, or every year on a subscription scheme.",
