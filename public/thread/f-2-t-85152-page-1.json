Is is roughly 1300-1400 miles from Sweden back to the UK, 7 countries in around 3 or 4 days and that is with an unknown vehicle! You at least have somewhere to sleep, eat &amp; rest on your trip.\n<br> Go for it and put yourself outside your comfort zone. Expect the worst but hope for the best...you will not regret it.\n<br> Take a camera and record your adventure.\n<br> \n<br> All the best,\n<br> \n<br> Johnny",
