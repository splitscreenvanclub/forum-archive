    "content" : "Looking to sell my Creative engineering deluxe belt line trim, I purchased this approx 6 months ago to fit to my 66 LHD bus but have changed my mind about using it.(Will also fit earlier models)\n<br>It has never been fitted hence it is as new and still has the protective film over it, comes complete with black insert. I would prefer collection in person from Newquay area as it could easily be damaged if posted.\n<br>Cost £395 plus shipping but will let it go for £300.",
