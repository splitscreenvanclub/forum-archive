    "content" : "Took my 67 Dudley cooker out for a good summer clean &amp; get all the rust out that seems never endlessly falling off from the burners grill etc.\n<br>\n<br>I turned it over to look at the grill part, as I am contemplating replacing the grill 'elements' as they are a bit holey! \n<br>Has anyone ever replaced these expanded metal parts, they are just clipped into the frame.\n<br>I read a thread, after a search on the internet, that most static caravan grills are the same and these grills regularly get replaced by a corgi gas engineer, so they, or similar, must be available I guess - But I can't find any online either that or I need to make some...\n<br>I thought I would just turn them around, but they are SO brittle that they fall apart at the slightest touch.\n<br>Do you think just normal mild steel expanded sheet or galv? I thinking galv is a BAD idea for my toast health - hahaha\n<br>Anyone ever done similar?\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsqaqqw44k.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsqaqqw44k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpscvxhki7z.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpscvxhki7z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Secondly - on the burner tubes there are some stainless spring clips that can rotate around the burner pipes opening &amp; closing the pipe to air - are these critical (as my center one (grill) is missing completely and the other two were fully open? - I can't quite see what these achieve? Is it to mix gas/air at the right rate?\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsxgqgpj3p.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsxgqgpj3p.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsrgsdardy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsrgsdardy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Cheers All",

    "content" : "The grill mesh is just ordinary mild steel mesh Ted. Don't use galvanised - zinc vapour is highly toxic so won't improve toast. The air supply clips are there to cope with different gases. The stove was designed for calor gas - propane I think - which needed slightly less air input. Most of these stoves are now used on butane so need the air inlets fully open. I would always use them fully open because it reduces the chances of carbon monoxide being produced due to incomplete combustion.",

    "content" : "OK - as I'm away next week in Devon - thought I'd have a go at fixing my grill - popped into B &amp; Q to see if they had anything like the expanded mesh stuff Dudley used on the grill element - they did actually have a selection - so I bought the closest I could find.... (made sure I got the steel version as they did the same size in aluminium!) - It was about Â£8 I think.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpsmcsfzcks.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpsmcsfzcks.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Its the same 'pitch' ie the holes are expanded to the same size, but once out of the packet its a slightly lighter weight mesh, the original stuff was a bit thicker, but this was the closest match that B &amp; Q had on the shelf - so I thought I'd give it a go...\n<br>\n<br>Thsi pic shows a comparison - you can see the difference in the gauge of metal - this photo seems to make it look worse than it is - but the new stuff is a bit thinner for sure...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zps2j5murj5.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zps2j5murj5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So after a bit of snipping with the tin snips I have fashioned some replacements - of course not content with just a straight replacement I have gone the extra mile to see if I can improve the grill performance and 'modded' the grill element to be much larger than the original - time will tell if this has worked..LOL\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1350.photobucket.com/user/ted698/media/temporary_zpszzj9jntx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1350.photobucket.com/albums/p769/ted698/temporary_zpszzj9jntx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So I'll keep you posted on how my turbocharged grill now performs - it may all melt onto my toast, as 'toast a la molten steel' or I may have just revolutionised the dudley cooker grilling capability (I suspect &amp; fear the former!)\n<br>\n<br>I'll let you know the outcome! - CHEERS",
