One that I'm really trying to get the details correct on\n<br>\n<br>Certainly the Kombi and Samba had chrome hubcaps.\n<br>\n<br>The Panel from what I can work out (and I would welcome anyone to correct me please) kept painted hubcaps until 53-54 era\n<br>\n<br>However, the colour of the hubcap is most debatable and the colour of the logo.\n<br>\n<br>If the van had all white wheels (Lotus white L82), then the hubcap was painted grey. The colour of the logo changed a few times though. It was either black or from sometime in 52/53 it changed to body colour. Also, the customer could specify colour-coded hubcaps in which case the logo would have been painted white.\n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps (or not!!)",
