I'm in the mood and going to try and dedicate some time to it over the coming weeks.\n<br>\n<br>Mean while I'm also going to tag on the Restro of my '63 Eriba Puck and my '71 Westy Trailer to this thread.\n<br>\n<br>Ok first one up the Westy Trailer.. I sold my last Westfalia Essen trailer which was a later one as I always wanted the slightly earlier one with the lighter wood and rear hoop stands.\n<br>\n<br>6 Months later I found an early one (1971) with potential and picked it up last friday on the way to my Brothers wedding up North\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9635_zpsf58e0c1e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Owned it for all of 5miles and was rear ended at a roundabout by a Lorry driver that wasn't paying attention! lasts 41 years before meeting me, 10mins later and its buggered lol\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9639_zps52224877.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So basically going to have the rear hoops re-fabricated and straighten out the frame and replace the Hella Lights. The plan is it to strip it bare, have the metal powder coated off white, new tyres/bearings/suspension bushes, replace/restore the wood, find/fit a new lock and find/fit a spare wheel carrier... and fit some Westy uprights to the lid.\n<br>\n<br>So the trailer in its new damaged state:-\n<br>\n<br>The vin plate, the second number of the Fabrik nr (Factory number) denotes the year of manufacture so 1 means 1971. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9677_zpsfd54f38d.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The hitch arm doesn't have the usual Westy tag and I assumed this meant it had been replaced or missing but it turns out that for one year only.. 1971 they didn't put the tags on!.. I'm assuming thats probably because they used the Winter Winterhoff hitches which had their own tag which has all the relevant info the Westy one would have had, so they stamped the arms with the factory instead too which I found.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9675_zps720cf006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9676_zps988ef047.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The underside is good, the metal wheel arches are going to need a bit of attention thou\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9672_zps010bc9a7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9674_zpsa1e3aef3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Westy%20Trailer%2071/IMG_9673_zpsd276234b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>More on this soon..\n<br>\n<br>Next up Puck Rodgers. I have fancied a Early Puck for a long time. Early as in a Smooth skin without the fridge vents and plastic windows, they are also lighter and more suited to being towed by a Bus, later ones (mid 70's) started to have a dimple effect skin which not only doesn't look as good but is also nigh on impossible to repair. After being out bid on a few that sold just under £4K and just over £4K one popped up that looked a bargain for the money... oh when will I learn.. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> .. wait and see how this one unfolds lol\n<br>\n<br>I wanted early and early is what I found! this one is a 1963, my Split was built in dec '63 so quite fitting \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> Earlier Pucks the lighter they are, the tag claims its 400kg which is the load limit of the the Westy trailer above! \n<br>\n<br>Early original Pucks are unbraked (no parking/hand brake either) have 8\" wheels (10\" ones on the later ones), the opening door is square and all windows bar the front are glass.\n<br>\n<br>The Puck as purchased:- \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/09C3C32E-1C63-4A5C-A49E-4C65ADE32DE4_zpsazxctzyv.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/0BCB95A9-3168-40A7-A3FF-ABD4BD04BF07_zps51yx6gri.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/EE5531F9-05FB-445B-AD67-B919C848F5E4_zpsfb6iajkf.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/172DB063-3F7A-4DBE-BD16-672D98E9BA77_zpsqfwedbna.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/4D7B74C9-C157-4367-8062-D3BAD3290372_zpsldo1lmha.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/669DB60D-9B19-4CA1-8376-2631A80E659E_zpsnbzaphob.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/08B7ECB5-7CC7-4BF0-98C3-68B119F719F3_zpshlbyseu6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/5580CCC0-5A1A-4330-BDFD-01C1409DFE67_zpswffctlrc.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/07708358-30BB-4B82-A3C6-C47A3F035DA2_zpsmn8zsgdi.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/4A186086-5B08-4788-92AF-CAD139529B23_zpsmvnkragp.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/260D7FCD-5B67-4E59-899E-2C8AE1154556_zpsz4qrsxoh.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Came with its original receipt too from 1963 \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/E7BA30C7-B965-4E2F-9ECC-BC6D56414DA2_zpspg8ikrgo.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Next update will show you want an absolute lemon i've bought \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",

The hinges on the door where home made jobbies and one of the rear number plate lights was missing its cover.
