    "content" : "I have fitted a swing axle (karmann Ghia) gearbox and axles coming straight out of a running car, butty`s spring plates and type 3 rear drums and back plates.\n<br>evrything bolts up and looks great but each time I tighten the hub nuts I amm getting an oil leak from the back of the backplate. When I take the drum off and remove the bearing cover it seens to have folded the bearing seal over in one place. Cant really get my head round it? Is it just inferior hub/bearing seals? as I have used ones from GSF, or am I missing out on something?\n<br>I have fitted the drum to the shaft without the back plate and bearing cover and put the hub nut on and seem to be able to pull about 30mm of shaft play outwards? is this normal?\n<br>Any ideas appreciated\n<br>Ben",
