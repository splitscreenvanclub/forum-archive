    "content" : "I'm trying to decide the best place to put the speakers in the cab of my little '59 bus. I already have them, so that narrows down the discussion on what to buy and I know where I want to put the rear speakers - more on that in a bit.\n<br> \n<br> Should I put my front speakers in the door panels or the kick panels? Does it really matter from a sound point of view? I have 6\" speakers with little tweeters attached (well they sit about 6\" away). I am planning on having door pockets as per the original door panels, so that limits my options within the door but is the door better than the kick panels? Is there anywhere else I haven't considered?\n<br> \n<br> I have a pair of 6x9s which I intend fitting either side of the rear drawers of my Devon interior facing up - I don't want to cut into the main devon units.\n<br> \n<br> Any suggestions or photos of what people have doen will be very much appreciated. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br> \n<br> Cheers,\n<br> \n<br> Dave",

What with the amount of road and wind noise, I think the closer to the front passengers heads, the better chance of hearing the music.\n<br> Currently I've 2 ideas: (1) a sheet of mild steel, folded and formed to bolt across the void above the sun visors, secured at the airbox side by the bolts that hold the angled face of the airbox with the other side held by the three sun visor screws. This would then have a hole cut to mount the full range speakers and would result in me not having to cut any part of the original bus... or (2) a custom MDF enclosure that fits the same void above the sun visors and is secured at the same positions as idea (1)\n<br> \n<br> I think the MDF idea would sound better, as it could achieve some back pressure if it was a closed box but the mild steel might look better if the finish was good and had a nice paint job that matched the airbox",
