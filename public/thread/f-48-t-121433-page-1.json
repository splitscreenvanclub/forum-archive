    "content" : "I've wondered what was fixed to these holes on my RHD Canterbury Pitt for some time so thought I'd ask. In all there are three pairs. I thought they might be for side lighting. Perhaps they are but three pairs seemed a bit much for that. The pair shown in the photo is just behind the B-post, driver's side. The next pair is at the same height in between the second and third windows back from the B-post. The third pair is directly opposite the second pair, just behind the rearmost, side cargo door.\n<br> \n<br> Any info/photos much appreciated. Thanks.",
