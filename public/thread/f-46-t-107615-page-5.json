How does the movable seat (nearest the door) affix to the floor, so that it doesn't just float about? It also confirms that the interior I have is complete (bar the cooker).",

    "content" : "I have just got to this stage myself this last week gone! This cabinet was designed to be easily removed so I wouldn't think it was ever mounted to floor? Starting with the cabinet in the top left corner against long panel and up against bulkhead, there is evidence of this cabinet mounting to floor in two places with small 'L' brackets ....... this cabinet has 3 recessed 'cylinders' on top surface, that take about a 10mm long pin, red arrows show their location in first photo below. The front cabinet you ask about has a pin on the underside edge that 'locks' into place in the recessed sleeve in the back left cabinet, enlarged below in 2nd photo.\n<br>The other 2 recessed cylinders, (indicated by red arrows) locate the small panel that forms part of the backrest, the top of which sits in under the long cabinet along bulkhead.\n<br>\n<br>The three arrowed inserts in my cabinet were all full of 'crap', took me awhile to work this out. I cleaned them out using a drill the same size. I also had to remake the locating pins using a hardened steel hinge pin that I epoxy glued into place. Two of the old pins had 'broken out' of the original position and were missing completely! \n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps?\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/584/21915681074_934fd890bd_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/658/22538963435_61c547425c_b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
