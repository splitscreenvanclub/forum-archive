Il post a link to the previous engine builds asap but suffice to say i paid good money and got turds. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So i am going to build a 1776cc twin kadron engine with scat c25 cam external oil filtration and cooling with inline thermostat for an in line cooler too.it will have a speedshop pressure relif oil pump take off and melling 30mm oil pump.and will be built around a brandnew autolinea race case.\n<br>\n<br>the reason for the spec is that its the parts i have left over from the last engine i built that was incorrectly linebored so suffered a seizure. Luckily all the internal parts survived untouched!\n<br>\n<br>Wish me luck this is my 3rd engine build so im still very green lol",
