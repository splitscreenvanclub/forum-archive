I am looking for some assistance with the installation of my new sunroof outer material on my samba. I have a trimmer who is willing to take on the task but we require some info on certain things. I am in the Bristol area so if there is anyone out there who could advise me or even better let me have a look at their roof it would be greatly appreciated. You can contact me via email or phone 07971575222. Thanks. John</strong>",
