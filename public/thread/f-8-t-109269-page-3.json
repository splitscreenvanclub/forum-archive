    "content" : "Spent another whole 9 hour day on the mango again today. \n<br>\n<br>Tackled the rear inner wheel tubs. Also scored a result in finding a lower early bulkhead repair panel so I can replace the whole thing rather than patch the old one. And at the end of the day my purchase on ebay of a spot welder arrived in time to fix a couple of top hats. Great bit of kit and worth its weight as so quick instead of plug welding. \n<br>\n<br>A few pics of before and after I took today.",
