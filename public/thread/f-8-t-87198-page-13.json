I fully expect to be approached on a regular basis by folk telling me that they've seen a picture of my shaft on a public forum and how lovely and solid it looks \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>Yeah, no lock out plate so you don't have to press down, just across.

My justification was that I've yet to hear anyone say it's not worth the money, it's a fantastic looking and very well made bit of kit plus if I couldn't get on with it I could always sell it for what it cost, possibly more due to the discount. \n<br>If you've got the cash to spare I'd say go for it, you won't be disappointed.

Depending on what additional interior parts your Pitt came with dictates how long the table is. Getting the correct brackets and hinges has been a complete nightmare but hopefully we may have solved a few of the problems. \n<br>Also the wood for the legs was originally a bit of an odd size thickness but we've used a special machine he has access to and basically thinned down all the wood for the legs to what it should be and it looks a lot more proportionate. More about tables another day though....\n<br>\n<br>I've also had the Buttys throttle linkage fitted. Although it doesn't really feel any smoother this is probably because mine wasn't too bad to start with and wasn't notchy feeling at all. I've certainly got more/full throttle movement at the pedal now though whereas I didn't before. Nice to get them 40's fully open \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> and hear a bit of induction roar \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> I've noticed that I don't have nearly as much side-to-side movement on the pedal or linkage now, which must be a good thing. It's also nice to know that the whole throttle linkage isn't 50 years old and could and probably would fall to bits at any moment and leave me stranded down a dark lane in the rain at the @rse end of nowhere \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> For what it cost is say it's a good bit of kit and worth having if only for peace of mind as its one less thing to go wrong. It's very well made, fits as it should without having to file this and cut that and bend this and alter that, which is a rarity in these times of sh!t aftermarket parts so cheers for the quality parts Butty \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">\n<br>Pics when it stops raining as I'll have to crawl under the bus to get them plus I've just had some more tattoo work done on my upper chest and it's all a bit sore at the moment and I don't fancy scrabbling around on the floor right now \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee. \n<br>\n<br>Ps if you want a repro Canterbury Pitt table let me know and we can discuss options \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

    "content" : "Far too cold this weekend to do anything on the van but with the impending roof alterations I got it ,it and did some measuring (see my thread in the tech section) and I should be able to fit a 2 bow front rack and a pig-ugly commercial transit builders style roof bar and be able to strap the longboards across the top of any poptop roof I get. That's the plan anyway, whether it works or not remains to be seen \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Then went out for a drive to the tip with Little Empi and Mrs Empi followed by a trip to the duck pond to feed the ducks as Little Empi likes ducks \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>That done he was about due a nap so we went for a mellow blatt up the dual carriageway and he fell asleep in his baby seat strapped in the front. Result. \n<br>Also got the engine up to temp to clear out any cobwebs that had accumulated over the last few weeks of it not being used. \n<br>\n<br>Mrs Empi had very thoughtfully bought me a rack of maxi-bins that were of offer at Aldi \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>So spent the rest of the afternoon putting them up in the garage. Once I had done that I decided to sort through a couple of tubs of nuts and bolts I have and separate them into 10mm nuts, 8mm nuts, 10mm long bolts, 10mm short bolts, 8mm long bolts and 8mm short bolts. Exciting times at Empster Mansions \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> To she honest there was a method in the madness as the last time I did anything I spent half the bloody time trying to rifle through tubs of nuts and bolts trying to find the right size so at least this way I can just go to the maxi bins and pick the right size out of the drawer. \n<br>\n<br>So that was my weekend \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

    "content" : "So at last I had a day off yesterday where it wasn't chucking it down with rain \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>Decided that a trip to the seaside with Little Empi was the order of the day, plus I had to call in and see a man about a roof \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>As soon as Little Empi heard the bus coming out of the garage he got all excited and put my trainers on and started running up and down the hallway shouting loads of stuff I couldn't understand. He knows when the bus comes out that it means we're going out for a drive and proper goes into one \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>Packed the bus up with all the random stuff a 22 month old needs for a cold windy day at the beach, checked the oil (dunno why as it's just been serviced), strapped in the baby seat, mrs Empi sorted out a packed lunch and off we went \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>Nice little run on fast there lane carriageways for most of the journey then small village roads for the last 10 miles or so. It's about 65 miles each way so was a good chance to blow the winter cobwebs out as I've only been doing local journeys that are just enough to get the engine up to running temps since Slough.\n<br>Cruised at a steady 65mph with minimal fuss and boy, does that Red9 soak up the bumps a treat \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> The temp guage sat at a healthy 190° all the way there at 65mph and about 3300rpm so more than happy with that. No rattles seem to have appeared over winter and the Bug-Tech shifter was a pleasure to use and only crunched one gear which was a bit of \"operator error\" when I got a bit carried away at a junction \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br>Anyhow, as soon as we could see the sea he started shouting again and pointing and getting all excited again as he loves being at the seaside and running about on the beach. He loves having his feet dipped in the waves as well but I wasn't planning on trying it this time of year in the English Channel \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> We managed to park right on the front. Right next to a sign that gave the parking restrictions as \"no caravans, no camper vans, no caravanettes\" I wasn't about to undo the good work of Peter Pitt and get arrested to prove it \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">wasnt</span> caravanette but reasoned that no one was likely to care on a cold winters day \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s991.photobucket.com/user/empi1/media/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpstrm8uk8m.png.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpstrm8uk8m.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>You can just see the sign on the left of the picture. It wasn't packed so we could basically choose our spot. Thinking about it, I should have got a picture of the sign and had it blown up and put it up in my garage \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\">",
