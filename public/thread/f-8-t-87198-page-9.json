    "content" : "Soooooo, the drive home..........\n<br>\n<br>Got to the end of the road where the Red9 workshop is and you have to do a sort of dog-leg left / right and as I didn't expect it to turn quite as quick as it did I kerbed it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>It felt a bit weird at first as the steering didn't centre itself without a bit of help like I'm used to but once you'd driven it a while you got used to it and didn't notice it. The roads were a bit sh!t and previously I'd be feeling every bump and pot hole and the suspension would have been banging and clanging as the ball joints bottomed out and due to the harsh ride I'd have been bouncing all over the seat.\n<br>Well there was none of that at all \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> it just rode over the bumps like a normal car. I found myself tensing up as I hit the bumps expecting the jolt I'd come accustomed to but it never came. \n<br>Got into the M-way for the long drive home and thought I'd give it some to see how it rode the long dips that you get on the motorway and it was absolutely fine. Again no banging or bottoming out. I even managed to pour a cup of coffee from my trusty flask into a normal cup and drink it without chucking it all over me or the bus. \n<br>The first thing I noticed once I got it up to speed was that my front wheels need balancing. Due to the play in the standard box I didn't really feel this but with the new system it was very apparent. \n<br>I also found that I could feel every track in the road that lorries leave as you could feel the twitch in the steering as it hit them. Bear in mind I run 155/65X14 tyres which are quite skinny so that didn't help (more of the tyres later). \n<br>The plan was to drive home in two hits as I'd not had much sleep and I was absolutely knackered but it just felt so easy to drive compared to before that I eventually just did it in one hit sat in the outside lane at 70 mph all the way. Most of the time I could just sit with one hand on the wheel with no problems at all, except the occasional twitch when the tyres found a groove in the road surface. \n<br>Got home with no issues at all but was so shattered that I just put it in the garage and chilled out and went to bed. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",

The castor angle is set by spacing the mounting of the wishbone accordingly. The various holes are so that you can mount the entire unit higher or lower then you use the coil-over to fine tune the ride height. \n<br>When I took a closer look when I got a chance I decided that it seemed to be sitting slightly higher than I wanted so you have two choices. You can move the whole unit by un bolting it and changing the the holes you bolt it back up with. This gives an inch difference per set of holes, or you can wind it up/down on the coil overs. \n<br>Each way had it's benefits and drawbacks. It's easier to use the coil overs as these are set about half way so you get about an inch and a half adjustment either way but it will affect the tracking as you're moving the steering arms relative to the wishbones but it's easy to do. By moving the whole unit on the mounting bolts the alignment doesn't change at all because you've not actually altered anything you have just sited the entire unit higher on the chassis rails. To me that looked like a bit of a nightmare of having to support the unit on jacks and the weight of the bus on more jacks and lowering it all into place to line up the mounting holes.",

Also the tyres.........when I'd been driving it as opposed to not feeling anything through the steering previously I could now feel everything and it certainly felt like the front tyres were tracking a bit and possibly jumping a bit as well, possibly because they were too narrow or possibly because the alignment wasn't spot on. Not sure but thought I'd have a looksie.....\n<br>I found that the inside edge of the front tyres had scrubbed almost down to the canvas \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> . \n<br>When I looked at it sat on the drive I couldn't make my mind up if the camber was way out or not.

    "content" : "I also spent about a week playing about with online tyre size calculators working out how much extra or less I would gain in sidewall height depending on what width I went for and how it would look if I dropped the front by an inch or so and what the difference would be in rolling circumference. I ended up with a bit of A3 sized paper with rather a lot of pencil lines and measurements on it that I could use to compare widths and sidewalls with on the half dozen sizes is narrowed my choice down to. \n<br>I settled on 175/60X14 and phoned my tyre shop of choice (chosen because they also have a 4wheel laser tracker and can do the camber as well) and told the man what I wanted. To which he said \" that's a bit of an odd size, what's that going on\" \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>I was also getting a tyre sorted as a spare for my bro in law but he runs 15\" rims with different size tyres front and rear but has a 14\" spare so I worked out what size would be best for him as well. Texted him the size and explained how I came to that conclusion and said it all makes sense if you understand how to decipher the sizes. He texted back that it might so if you're Stephen Hawkins \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Tyres duly ordered and arrangements made to take the bus in to get two new fronts plus me using their ramp for half and hour to play about with the ride height and then them to set the tracking and the camber and check the castor. \n<br>If I had decided to just remove and re-mount the entire Red9 unit then the tracking shouldn't change but the minute you start using the adjustment on the coil overs it alters the toe in/out as you're changing the angle of the steering arms. I opted to adjust the height using the coil overs as I only wanted to drop it a small amount and to be perfectly honest didn't fancy un bolting the whole lot. Also I \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">think</span> by altering the ride height by the coil overs it might also alter the camber as the angles of the top and bottom wishbones will change in relation to each other unless they are of equal length ? But I could be wrong on that....\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee. \n<br>\n<br>Ps the wheels cleaned up a treat.
