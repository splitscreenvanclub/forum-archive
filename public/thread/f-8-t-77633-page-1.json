I'm hoping someone might be able to shed some light on its previous life as it looks like it may have had a EZ Camper/Sundial conversion in the past. Its the three cut out windows on the nearside that worry me the most I have no idea how to deal with these I guess I 'll have fun finding out thou.",

It works a treat. Slow work but does the least damage, imo. I have an air fed grinding mask so the dust isn't a problem for me at all.\n<br>\n<br>Don't ever be tempted to use a heat gun, it is possible if your nor careful to distort a panel.\n<br>\n<br>Frank",
