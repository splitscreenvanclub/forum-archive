I’m finding I’m using it less and less what with work commitments and the fact that I also have another splitscreen bus.\n<br>The whole of last year, I only did 1300 miles in it.\n<br>So that’s why it’s up for sale now.\n<br>\n<br>Price is firm so no lowballers/chancers. I’m not desperate to sell. If I don’t get what I want for it, it stays in my garage. Simple.\n<br>\n<br>Full specification listed below.\n<br>\n<br>Year: 1959\n<br>Type: Volkswagen Transporter Microbus\n<br>Body Style: 15 Window Deluxe\n<br>Colour: Metallic Grey (Lower), White (Upper)\n<br>Engine Capacity: 2332cc\n<br>\n<br>Description\n<br>Manufactured on 26th July 1959 and originally sold in Los Angeles USA. Imported into the UK around June/July 2003. This type of vehicle is commonly known as a 15 window deluxe. The 15 window was a factory option variant of the 23 window deluxe, I.E. it was specially ordered from the VW factory (M Code 130) without roof skylights or sunroof fitted.\n<br>In terms of scarcity, the 15 window deluxe is much rarer than the 23 window deluxe.\n<br>Being a 59, it has bullet indicators at the front end and round rear tail/brake/indicator lights at the rear end.\n<br>\n<br>The vehicle has been restored to a high specification. All rusty body panels have been replaced with the correct aftermarket repair panels. The bodywork, chassis and floor pan are all straight and virtually rust free.\n<br>The paintwork is in very good condition.\n<br>The drive train and braking system has been updated using modern technology and superior aftermarket parts.\n<br>The interior retains its original 1959 middle seat. All the interior seating has been retrimmed in matching grey velour. The door cards/panels have been retrimmed in quality grey vinyl.\n<br>\n<br>Full Specification:\n<br>Engine\n<br>The engine was custom built to my specification in November 2006 at a cost of £5200. \n<br>Dyno’ed at 162bhp maximum power and 166lbft maximum torque.\n<br>The engine has done approximately 6000 miles with no mechanical problems at all.\n<br>Specification as follows:\n<br>• Bugpack Aluminium Highroof case (Shuffle pinned/Filled in behind #3/Drilled, tapped oil galleys /hand ported interior/deep #3 stud).\n<br>• C.B.
