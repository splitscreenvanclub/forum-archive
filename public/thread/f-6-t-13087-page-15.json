You can use early bay springplates (or creative adjustable) and brakes, hubs, backing plates etc (which I already have) with them but you need to use the supplied a-arms along with the brackets. Price is £545 for the full kit or £50 less without the springplates...saves cutting off the frame horns too\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Steve",
