We've made a test set up that have been fitted to a bus (I'll try and get Sean to post some before and after pics shortly), but they will be laser cut to follow the profile ot the A arms, and fit between the spring plate and A arm, and are machined down to suit the bus/ride height.\n  <br> \n  <br> Not got final costs yet, but would imagine they will be somewhere in the region of £50 per pair\n  <br> \n  <br> Just wanting to judge if there is any interest?\n  <br> \n  <br> Cheers\n  <br> \n  <br> Neil\n </div>\n</blockquote> Be interested mate, just about to replace the rear tyres as worn too much on the inner edge due to camber.",

As the body rolls during cornering it increases tyre contact with road surface. If you start with zero camber you will lose contact with body roll.\n<br> No IRS setup is meant to have zero camber. Even stock bays have a bit of neg camber unlike a stock split.\n<br> \n<br> Remember they're SPRING plates....they're meant to twist and flex.",
