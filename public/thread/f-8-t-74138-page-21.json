    "content" : "Cheers son...\n<br>Was really nice to see the northern continegent of the clan...\n<br>The boys behaved......well......like boys..\n<br>Some super photos of them in their kilts..\n<br>\n<br>Tyres pressures now set at 31psi in the fronts and 37psi in the rears.\n<br>I have increaed the fronts slightly to see if the turning effort is any different..\n<br>When I was loaded up moving stuff and people seemed really quite stable...\n<br>\n<br>Has what I wanted grunt for the hills and reasonable speed at low revs for the Motorway...withut too discernable a gap.\n<br>3200 turning just under 60 m.p.h.\n<br>Oil pressure good and oil temperature quite OK without a cooler.\n<br>\n<br>Looking now to see if the CHT is calibrated..or if we are just using as a \"comparator\".\n<br>\n<br>Found the instructions on line..\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.dakotadigital.com/pdf/odyr-11.pdf\">http://www.dakotadigital.com/pdf/odyr-11.pdf</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>We have it set for degrees F like the vdo Oil temperature gauge......So German/ continental/ VW/ vdo would be Fahrenheit anyway..\n<br>in order to give a like wise scale I asked for the CHT to be in Fahrenheit..\n<br>You cannot calibrate the gauge per se...You can change the scale and set the warning level.\n<br>The gauge is not accurate at low levels but the internal cirucitry raises the reading to 90-150F and the readings show above 150F. When ticking over or travelling at 30mph in 3rd is below 150 so that sounds OK.\n<br>Our warning is set at the minimum which I have now established was 300F.\n<br>\n<br>The highest I saw all week end when I was driving was top end of the 230s maybe we are running fine then!\n<br>On coming off the motorway after a trial of 60 for around 10 miles it rose to 247...sounds fine..\n<br>\n<br>There were comments on here about head temparture readings..Will have to read..\n<br>\n<br>Dad",
