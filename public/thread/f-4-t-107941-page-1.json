    "content" : "Had hold of this little lot for a while now. I'd initially planned to configure it somehow to fit in my 1960 LHD walkthru samba but to be honest think it could be more hassle than it's worth. I also have the table top although the melamine doesn't match the cookers top. The back seat and cupboard is reproduction by a guy in Doncaster. The rare devon bread bin and over buddy seat cupboard is og as is the cooker unit. The cushion set is unused (one is at my trimmers still so is a complete set however you decide to fit it). I also have the correct profile lengths of oak to fit on the back of the rear seat section. Not sure how many RHD walkthru buses are out there but this would fill the back up nicely. Easycool is in good condition and includes the drip tray and walkthru pull out section. Not 100% sure how it would all work in a bus but a good start for a nice looking interior. I'd like £1850 ono for it all. One buddy seat bottom and your nearly done. Collection from East Yorkshire.\n<br>\n<br>Pictures can be seen at: \n<a href=\"http://s1219.photobucket.com/user/BusjunkieUK/library/Devon%20Interior\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://s1219.photobucket.com/user/BusjunkieUK/library/Devon%20Interior</a>",
