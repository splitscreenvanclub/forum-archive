Our bus just scrapes into the criteria for what can go on show, its a '67 Kombi that will be shiney by then. So we are planning on registering it for the show and getting the tickets for all the evening entertainment etc. Our good friends are joining us but none of their vehicle can get in (vehicle are too new or Rat Look) and they also have kids. There is no mention on the website about costs for kids and can people get tickets for the evening entertainment etc that you get if you register a vehicle for the show if they don't have a registered show vehicle?",
