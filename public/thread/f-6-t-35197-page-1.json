    "content" : "There never was a connection from the HEs Jon. The VW Heritage part is a repro of the original hot air spout that fits below the second large hole in the tinware on the RHS of the engine. Assuming you have a second hole that is. The OG spouts are insulated with a grey jacket (probably made of asbestos!).\n<br> \n<br> You can buy these secondhand from Volksheaven and Megabus or from fleabay. Be careful though because the 1200 ones have different brackets to the 1300/1500/1600 spouts. \n<br> \n<br> Do they work - YES! I have seen lots of iced up carbs in winter due to lack of proper air filters and no spout.\n<br> \n<br> The spout works by drawing hot air from the RHS cylinders into the OG air filter before the carb has a chance to ice up. If the old JK forum ever recovers from the server crash, there is a good explanation of how the whole system works in a thread called \"original air filter\"",

    "content" : "Some engines did have a pre-heat from a heat exchanger into the air filter. My old '67 for one. Though the pipe is only about 20-25mm rather than the larger one that would fit that 'scoop'.\n<br> \n<br> The style of the one in the picture works well on one of our cars.",
