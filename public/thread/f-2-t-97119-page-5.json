No idea how expensive it is, but that way you could plan into your bookings a colour change honouring existing pink bookings and planning date to 'Reveal' the new colour by taking future bookings stating the bus is being refurbished and will be ivory (for example). \n<br> \n<br> From a not that girly girl point of view I wouldn't go for pink. \n<br> For a wedding, white, ivory or even black, pastel blues/greens.",

They said he'd had it too long, when he had it for 3 weeks whilst the garage fixed his and he'd used my car for two weeks before that! Anyway, we refused to pay for it and they threatened court, to which we said OK. They backed out and paid all fees the day before court. \n<br> \n<br> If you've got strong evidence, like we did, do not settle and say you'll see them in court. They tend to be put off by the fact they'll have to pay the fees if they lose.",

My police report said, came over hill , saw car, swore, woke up on road. The police found it was his fault and offered a fine or re-education but the insurance after 3 years of fighting and turning down offers the most I got it up to 80/20. Their insurance eventually made a part 34 offer( I think it was a while back) which meant that unless I won significantly more than they were offering in court I would be responsible for costs from the day of the offer so I settled. I do hope you get it sorted but unfortunately life isn't fair.",
