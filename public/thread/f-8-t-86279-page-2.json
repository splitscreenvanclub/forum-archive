    "content" : "Started laying out the chassis today. Thankfully the 996 suspension mounting points are only 18mm further out from the original vw chassis rails so will not require too much additional metal work either side of the originals. Front of gearbox will require its own little cut out in the cab floor but looking good so far. The great bonus is that i have a shed load of space between the engine lid and the engine fan as i am not hostage to having to use the original torsion tube. \n<br>\n<br>Next stage is to cut the chassis rails and start tack welding the sub frame together. May even get it square and true! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7693131238_69b43250dc_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>(sack cart not included!)",

The front will be 964 pure and simple. I am building a new chassis front to back and bolting the 964 sub frame with wish bones straight on. The same will be done at the back with the 996 sub frame. I will have to get a bespoke torque tube/drive shaft made and the drive shafts will be one off's. \n<br>\n<br>Oh the engine conundrum, i purchased the engine when i was going down the 944t torsion tube/swing arms rear wheel drive only option and when it would have been a great engine for the project. Now, after a certain amount of mission creep, its going to be 4x4 i am not sure. I would need to be able to sell the motor and purchase a 3.6 for the money i make as the piggy bank is showing Empty.",

Sounds confusing but kinda opposite of my build.\n<br>\n<br>Are you going to run the torque tube in a hump in the floor or keep it below stock bus centerline?\n<br>\n<br>My build has alot of the same design problems but different solutions.\n<br>\n<br>Would love to see you start a thread at Pelican Parts in the vw/porsche conversion forum, as you are going to spend a bunch of time there!
