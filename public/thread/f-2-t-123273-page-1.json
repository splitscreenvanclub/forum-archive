The VW Engine Company 130-132 Verdant Lane is not that far from me, so I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience of using them either good or bad. Any advice would be much appreciated. \n<br> \n<br> I also need to have a few touch ups on the paint work, if anyone could recommend anyone in SE london that would be great. \n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Helen",

Not a good choice for a big heavy bus as they run hot. 1776 is much better - loads more power and torque and they run cool.",
