    "content" : "Yes, as I understood that VWJim recommended you remove 5mm off the top of the studs, which is a great idea. To be sure, measure this and make sure that this leaves you with the right amount of stud for your nuts to tighten around the lug holes. You can use a couple of washers I suppose, but trimming the bolts as suggested would be the better option, especially when you consider that a lot of shops use impact wrenches to put wheels on these days \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">",

    "content" : "i would like to try the washers first and see how that works. the studs that i bought have a hex hole in the end for tightening them up, so if i trim the end of the stud then its limiting how far i can get the hex key in to tighten them up. unless theres another way of tightening them up without the hex key?\n<br>will try it with one stud and let you know how i get on.\n<br>\n<br>one other thing, does anyone know the torque setting for the studs in the rotors?",
