    "content" : "Earlier this year a van owners worst nightmare happened and the engine caught fire. Thankfully the fire brigade were very quick and after some haggling with the insurers I got the van back and it's well on the way to recovery. \n<br>Following the fire the existing original headlining was stripped out and i now need some good pictures showing this, so that the very good headlining man i knows how to replace it.\n<br>\n<br>The van is 1961 with a Devon interior if that makes any difference. Any good picture particularly the front bit around the vent would be much appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>Kevin",
