More pebbles than sand to be fair but stunning place to camp none the less!\n<br>\n<br>Can get reviews on it from \n<a href=\"http://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/wales/snowdonia/gwynedd/cae-du\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.coolcamping.co.uk/campsites/uk/wales/snowdonia/gwynedd/cae-du</a>\n<br>\n<br>Its a wee bit remote but take your own entertainment and its a great spot, the farmer drives round on a night selling bags of wood to burn - extremely rare these days!\n<br>\n<br>Would highly recommend it!\n<br>\n<br>P",
