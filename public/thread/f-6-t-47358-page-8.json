    "content" : "Keeping the centre pin does have some advantages. ie the steering geometry from centre pin to wheels is retained. So if all the parts are new from pin to wheels, then there's nothing wrong with that design. Though going either route should give good responsive steering if built well. £500 all in for a steering upgrade isn't a bad price compared to the cost of the parts for a steering box rebuild.",
