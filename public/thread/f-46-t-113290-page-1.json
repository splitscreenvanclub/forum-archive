    "content" : "Whilst having a little look on ebay this weekend I noticed a little red formica table listed as less than 5 miles away. A few measurements by the seller and I drove round to have a look...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/3500F612-E529-4C73-A866-06094A7A1FF0_zpsltqwaouz.png.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/3500F612-E529-4C73-A866-06094A7A1FF0_zpsltqwaouz.png\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I couldn't believe that it was an exact match for my existing red interior! It was 4mm longer and about 5mm narrower than original but I figured it'd be a great place to start. I got it home, unscrewed the legs and (as it was getting dark and I'm impatient) thought I'd try and see how it fits....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/6680CBB8-44D3-4A34-ACF5-6419CD28154E_zpssqakzqp3.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/6680CBB8-44D3-4A34-ACF5-6419CD28154E_zpssqakzqp3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s747.photobucket.com/user/scottyn/media/A5C280D9-A26B-4A44-837B-7B4FD65F3E9B_zpshgmwkrho.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i747.photobucket.com/albums/xx118/scottyn/A5C280D9-A26B-4A44-837B-7B4FD65F3E9B_zpshgmwkrho.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>I figured it's a great place to start and for a bargain thirty quid got to be better than the piece of mdf in there at the mo. \n<br>\n<br>The plan is to remove the existing table brackets and fit the devon ones for now. \n<br>\n<br>The bus is going in for new panels, flooring, curtains and cushions in a few weeks so i'll be sure to add some ones when the tartan has gone!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Scott",

    "content" : "Both of the above could work, but you'd have to be very skilled. A \"Router\" or a \"Spindle Moulder\" is probably the best tool for cutting it, or a \"Table Saw\" with a very fine and sharp blade. If using a saw, I'd cut a tad bigger and use a sharp plane to finish it. Make sure they bond the extra ply on first. But like you say, I'm sure they'd know all this.\n<br>\n<br>Good Luck",
