My shifter came in bubble rap with no instructions or other parts.\n<br> Thanks Lee.",

    "content" : "the 1st one I got with the CSP shifter looked very similar, but it bent after driving the van for a short while, making it almost impossible to get reverse. CSP replaced it with a different one which was much thicker and now everything seems ok. Another problem I had was that the ball would not reach the socket properly so every time I went for reverse it would slip out. CSP do two different shifters where the length between the shift plate and the socket varies however neither fitted my bus properly. I ended up cutting the ball off and welding in an extension piece then welding the ball back on. Now the shifter works great. Not sure if anybody else had this problem could just be a slight difference with the linkage on mine.",

    "content" : "Hi dsbus.\n<br> Thanks for the reply,i'm now thinking that i have been supplied the wrong year shifter as csp do 3/4 different models for the various years of bus. My van was built in 1957 but the standard shifter seems to have a larger ball on the end than the csp one. When fitted the csp was very sloppy and hard to find a gears. The csp shifter does'nt seem to have any model number on it to track year/years specific.\n<br> Looks like i'm going to have to stick with the standard shifter or buy a new one,as it was purchased 18 month ago.\n<br> Cheers Lee.",
