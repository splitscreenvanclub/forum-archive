    "content" : "Hi there -- we'll be travelling up to Busfest (only the second trip in our van !!!) and looking for campsites/wildcamping suggestions. Starting off in Paris, visiting friends in Bath, then across Severn Bridge, along Wye Valley on A466 or minor roads through Chepstow, Monmouth, Ross on wye, Hereford, Ledbury area. Any ideas for camping sites/places to visit along Bath to Malvern route in the few days prior to Busfest? Thanks and hope to meet many members there \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">",
