Also if you do want to polish later, you can't polish over varnish as the varnish coats the wood rather than permeating it.\n<br>\n<br>Varnish also blocks the bleaching effect of the sun and so allows the oak to darken over time - when you see buses with almost mahogany coloured units that started off as yellow oak, they've either been varnished or kept in the dark for 30 years.\n<br>\n<br>Shellac / French polish is what was used originally and can be touched up, blended in and added to over time. It isn't waterproof which is why we all have nice stains and patina all over our old interiors. It doesn't block the light, which is why our wardrobes have got the authentic 'light patch' on the side.\n<br>\n<br>If you ARE looking to darken / stain for any reason then I was also told that making up a reduction with teabags is the way to go. The tannins in tea are the same as in the oak which is what darkens it (when the bleaching of the sun isn't reversing that process). So if you're wanting to age a restored unit to match the colour of the rest of your interior or to darken your white bits, then a really strong cup of tea really will help \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>All passed on knowledge from wiser heads...",

Don't worry about french polishing. The Devon factory used very basic techniques - a Devon interior doesn't need a finish like a grand piano! The great thing about french polish is that it partly dissolves the original polish and blends in perfectly. Just make up a 'rubber' using a piece of lint free cotton cloth wrapped around a wodge of cotton waste or coarse cotton wool. You need one around 2\" in diameter. Thoroughly 'wet' it with the polish, then squeeze some out, then apply with a circular motion, overlapping as you go. You might have to use overlapping straight line application for some areas. If can, practice first on some old bits of furniture. You'll soon getthe hang of it. Keep the rubber moving at all times or it will stick to your nice restored surface. Lots of vids on YouTube. \n<br>Brian",
