    "content" : "Ex Catholic School Bus 'Quasimodo' \n<br> \n<br> It comes with a heavy heart that I am having to sell my patina monster American school bus. \n<br> \n<br> As featured in Hayburner 17 and Bus Junkies Website \n<br> \n<br> This is a unique opportunity to own a true VW one off, an instantly recognisable bus that is known world wide and in my opinion one the coolest busses on the current scene. \n<br> \n<br> I imported it back in 2014 from Utah and most of 2015 was spent bringing this bus up to MOT standard for the uk. \n<br> All metal work that needed replacing was replaced , but as much of the original metal was also saved where possible. \n<br> Cargo floor replaced as were, \n<br> Cab floor \n<br> Inner and outer cills \n<br> Battery tray \n<br> All work carried out at VeeDubs in Welling,Kent \n<br> \n<br> The bus passed its MOT first time no problems \n<br> \n<br> The main brief was to keep it as close to as it was found, inside and out. \n<br> \n<br> The school bus was a working vehicle that was based at the Notre Dame High School in Price,Utah. \n<br> \n<br> The original logos are still present on the bus more clearly on the passenger side. \n<br> \n<br> It was used to take student two and from campus plus secondly used a general dogs body moving equipment etc as and when the school or church needed it. \n<br> I found it it was used roughly between 1969-73. This was all confirmed by a local newspaper in Utah that ran a story for me when I imported it. \n<br> \n<br> After its working life it was abandoned in a field hidden by a barn and bushes, it was last registered in 1973. \n<br> \n<br> Around 2010 it was rescued and some work was done to the suspension , engine etc it then changed hands that's when I bought it and imported it to the u.k. \n<br> \n<br> The interior has been left so the original two rows are present, the folding seat was broken in transit but I have the frame still, this along with the original steels (two are crows) will come with the bus as will the matching cooler. \n<br> \n<br> Outer cills have been airbrushed to match the amazing patina \n<br> \n<br> Engine is a 1776 single carb \n<br> Wheels - 356 chrome reps \n<br> Body work is treated with ankor wax \n<br> Safaris front and rear \n<br> Narrow beam / suspension was all fitted in USA, I have pictures of all this work being done also. \n<br> Original bus tickets and paperwork found in the bus , plus news paper article run in Utah will come with any receipts I have. \n<br> Condition of bus is as seen, believe me it's extremely solid even though it may not look it ! \n<br> All pop outs work both side \n<br> It even has the original rest seat belts.. \n<br> \n<br> This is a iconic one off bus since completion it has only been to two shows and is ready to be shown off. \n<br> \n<br> I have hundreds of pictures if you need anything else or go to the busses Instagram page @schoolbus63 \n<br> \n<br> Anyone that knows me knows what this bus means to me, please don't waste my time, serious buyers only, if my personal circumstances hadn't have changed so drastically this bus would be staying put. \n<br> \n<br> As mentioned above a full feature can be seen in Hayburner 17 - if you are a serious buyer call for a chat I'll be happy to answer any questions. \n<br> \n<br> Contact number is DOWN , PLEASE EMAIL \n<br> Email - \n<a href=\"mailto:dankevporter@hotmail.co.uk\">dankevporter@hotmail.co.uk</a> \n<br> \n<br> Price is Â£22k Ono \n<br> I will listen to good honest offers as the sale is needed to fund future plans \n<br> \n<br> The Bus has 8 months MOT \n<br> \n<br> I can help with shipping if needs be.\n<br> \n<br> Click link for pictures \n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/detail.php?id=1987172\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/ ... id=1987172</a>",
