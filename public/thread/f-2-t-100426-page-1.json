    "content" : "Hello everyone - just a new member / owner saying hello.\n<br> \n<br> Bought my first splitty (of ebay \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> ), a 66 back in November and have been enjoying her a weather permitting. At some point It has been imported from Austria and had a restoration of sorts as well I think. Have been lurking for a while and joined the club in the new year...\n<br> \n<br> Had been looking for about 8 months until the right bus, in the right place, right location and the right price turned up. And eventually mine turned up 10 miles from home \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> It is what you would call an 'honest' bus, no a show one, and it is the realising of a family dream after hiring one a few years back which we enjoyed. It was better investment that the cash sitting in a bank on zero interest is what I tell myself. So far the only thing I have done is have had rear belts fitted in the back by Richard at Voodoo VW.\n<br> \n<br> It complements my other garage vehicle a Caterham fitted with a powerful motor bike engine that I use for hillclimbs and sprints \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/caterhamhayabusa\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.youtube.com/caterhamhayabusa</a> and although road legal is no fun on the road and not really family friendly, but does mean the garage is rather crowded, and we had some anxious moments getting everything in when I took it home for the first time \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> So after using it for a while I have tons of questions, which I am sure are in the archives but I find it hard to get definitive answers...\n<br> \n<br> 1. the lights are shocking, is it a case of they are all like that, or can anything be done to improve the front lights, also the lenses are for the continent and will fail the MOT and I realise I can just put some tape on, I was also wondering if I can buy lenses that are appropriate for driving on the left \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n<br> 2. although the side mirrors are I think genuine they are also close to useless, especially on the motorway, what are the options for improving rear visibility \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n<br> 3. am going to invest in an awning and have been looking at the inflatable ones, anyone have any experience\n<br> 4. besides using photobucket can I use any other document sharing sites. Typically I use skydrive/onedrive and can embed images using an &lt;iframe&gt; tag but I don't think that is supported on here...\n<br> \n<br> cheers\n<br> \n<br> rob",

    "content" : "Hi Rob,\n<br> \n<br> 1. I'm guessing you may have the sealed beam headlights still in which case you can upgrade to halogen lights. The pattern will be on the headlight and you have clear lenses on the front. \n<br> 2. I assume you have the small round mirrors then. You can get bigger mirrors if you so wish. Have a look at a couple of different buses and you'll soon come across different styles.\n<br> 3.

(and several water leaks) \n<br> \n<br> Our solutions: \n<br> 1: Try to reach all destinations by nightfall, if not pull up and get cosy for the night or guess where you're going. \n<br> 2: Set both mirrors before you go out and then just forget about the passenger one and keep trying to adjust the drivers one whilst driving and as required or open the window and look out. Buses are not that big and handily cuboid. \n<br> 3: We have retro metal pole awning and a khyam motordome quick errect an hour to peg down model which is ok \n<br> 4: I just put photos on from my iPad which I've minimised to upload requirements but they don't archive well. \n<br> \n<br> 1 and 2 are part of the fun I think (plus many other foibles) we don't worry any more \n<br> \n<br> Happy motoring",
