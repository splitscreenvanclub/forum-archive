So I have no guide to work from.\n<br>\n<br>Could someone with 10 minutes (and preferably an original fitted roof) please take some pics and some measurements for me? I need to understand the correct position of the front hinge and back hinge. You can use any datum points for the measurements, as long as you take pictures to support / explain it.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for your help on this one. It's really important that I get it right.",
