I will refund item cost but not the postage costs ....... Cant be fairer than that ..... \n<br>People that bought the first 5 sets are ...... \n<br> \n<br>1) Chaser`s down for a pair ............ \n<br>2) lambretta ................ \n<br>3)kilgore ........... \n<br>4)wilgartw ............ \n<br>5) utting30.............. \n<br> \n<br>So if the feedback is encouraging , i will buy in more of it , if not then i will look for other alternatives ....",

They would then be a rockin`set of rubbers, subject to water test. \n<br> \n<br>I did as an afterthought apply some silicon (black instant gasket) between the outer lip and the window aperture to stop water getting under the seal and rotting out the panel or creeping over the flange and getting inside.",
