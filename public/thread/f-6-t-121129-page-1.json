    "content" : "Hi,\n<br> \n<br> Struggling with getting my upper passenger door hinge pin out, rented the tool which seems to be doing the rounds on FB to see if this would help. But after spending a couple of hours trying to budge the pin, even with my old man as an assistant &amp; a 4ft extension on the spanner, this thing has not moved at all.. I reckon 50 years of wear &amp; tear has corroded this to the inside of the hinge.\n<br> \n<br> I think I have two options, 1). Take it to someone who can drill it out or 2). find a replacement hinge, which doesn't have a pin and swap it over with mine. I've not seen anyone that sells hinges. So if someone knows anyone selling a hinge, drop me a PM or if you can advise of an alternative method to remove the pin, then that would be appreciated. I thought this tool would have been my answer, but the pin is being stubborn... I'm really writing this due to frustration more than anything else..\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=26080&amp;sid=ee931be00c23616a07155da7ad1fb43b&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=26080&amp;t=1&amp;sid=ee931be00c23616a07155da7ad1fb43b\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"HingeTool.JPG\" title=\"HingeTool.JPG (115.64 KiB) Viewed 765 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n The attachment \n <strong>HingeTool.JPG</strong> is no longer available\n</div> Ta,\n<br> SW",

    "content" : "Not sure how long you've rented the tool for, but I'd recommend leaving it on the hinge under pressure. Add heat and lubricate daily. Keep tightening the tool to keep pressure on the pin.\n<br> \n<br> I think it took about a week under pressure before my lower hinge pin broke free and a couple more days before it came out completely.\n<br> \n<br> I was only using a modified g-cramp though. I didn't have that tool.",
