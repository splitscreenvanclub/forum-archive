There are 6 side curtains, 1, I think is the rear window curtain and 2, longer curtains which each have a curtain line with eye and hook on each. How do these go in the van. Are they for the front , if so how do they hook on. I have the tie backs ,only 1 is incomplete. How many should I have. I also have what appears to be the og mounting plastic pieces that are fixed to the curtains. How do these fix to a curtain rail.",

The curtain has 5 small holes, close to the bottom, where I think poppers have been. There was some slight tape marks on the same area, perhaps in substitute for fixing.The curtain bottom will need some slight attention just to tidy it up. I think a curtain person could put some poppers back in The 2 long curtains ,I have a small tinfull of the plastic pieces which I think will be enough for them both. You called the rail/plastic bits, slideminto. Can I get the rail etc. As for the tie baccks ,I have 7 tie backs . They even have the og screw still in them.

But Devon also made complete campers that went into VW dealerships to be sold - those are the vans that had 'standard' curtain colours matched with the paint colour, so green curtains etc with Velvet Green paintwork, red with red/white vans and blue with Sea Blue/white vans.\n<br>Similar matches were made to the bay vans - Sierra Yellow/Pastel White bays almost always had yellow striped curtains. \n<br>I know this from conversations with ex-employees. I have seen very OG Devons with all sorts of curtain colours. Our Sea Blue/Blue White 1967 Spaceway was taken back to Sidmouth in 1972 to have new red curtains (bay striped) fitted because the owner didn't like the OG blue checked curtains.\n<br>\n<br>BTW - the set the Saint has are completely original and in awesome condition, possibly because they were ordered as a spare set, apparently it was common for people to buy a spare set with the van. We have a spare set in our 72 bay - and no, I'm not selling them! The sliders in the pic were indeed for the Devon curtains and, as Maddy says, go into Silentgliss rail, but the curtain hooks were chromed metal not plastic. They are NLA but I might know where there is a stash of NOS \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> Be warned though - they go rusty after a few years.",

    "content" : "Hi BJ1, thanks for that info. The curtains apparently were in dry storage for over 20 years. They arrived at my place last Sunday and still have the musty smell, and will need a very gentle clean. I also bought the complete interoir, to go into another bus when I can afford to buy another. The cushions had been recovered, and the og material in vgc is underneath it, so they have been kept in good order. I am trying to get my Torvette Spaceway rhd bus back to og as much as I can. I have nearly everything, including coooker which bolts onto passenger seat. To have some og hooks would be fantastic. The only other thing which is missing are the 2 front seats. There both more than a struggle to find, but I am waiting for 2 walkthrough seats to arrive from US. I will try to adapt. I know the D. seat is wider than normal, but if all fails at least I will have an og pair of walkthroughs to sit on, looking better than other seats. If you could try and find the nos hooks, I would be extremely grateful. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks for helping me.",
