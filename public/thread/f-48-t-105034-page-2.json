Can you remember the sink unit and what the fold out draining board was like? Also what's the piece that goes across the middle from side to side? Looks like it's got some sort of arm/support on it that I've never seen. I'm really intrigued by this and the bus it came out of. Do you have any pics of the bus at all and the interior layout? Also what was the cooker unit and cooker like please and was it a pop-top? Is there any chance it was a Pitt-Moto made before the collaboration with Canterbury Sidecars in Ockendon? \n<br> Cheers, Lee.",

I'm trying to source the right length measured from pivot to pivot. I've recently taken over Camper Interiors (Caravan Supplies) from Stan and Jennifer and we have a supply of the shorter 8\" brackets, but there is also a 10\" and a 10 1/2\" version, both hard to come by and we'd like to stock some for CP owners, but it would be useful to get the right ones! cheers Kevin",

The distance, centre to centre, between the outer pivots is 9 1/2”. As I've previously searched for a suitable bracket myself and if useful, you can find a pic of an original support bracket compared to a 10” Stanley one in the 'Canterbury Pitt table restoration' thread in the CP section (not sure how to add a reference number).\n<br> Kind regards,\n<br> Peter",

As you'll see it's pretty much the same, just a bit narrower and I think the mounting holes don't quite match the originals due to the slightly different mounting bracket shape. If you have a look on ebay they are often listed as drop leaf table supports or something similar. When I got mine I double checked with the seller what the actual length was before ordering as quoted lengths can be confusing. I've just had a look and you might like to check out item number 262569262072.\n<br> Kind regards,\n<br> Peter",
