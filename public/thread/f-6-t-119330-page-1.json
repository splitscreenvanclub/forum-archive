    "content" : "Hi guys.\n<br> \n<br> I'll shortly be having my gearbox out and,after speaking to Paul from Bears, I'm wanting to replace all the bushes.\n<br> \n<br> It seems that there's 2 types of gear linkage set ups - see diagram - mine is the one on the bottom.\n<br> \n<br> I'm going to need the 19 I think.\n<br> \n<br> What's the part number and where can I get it from? Gfs doesn't seem to stock them.\n<br> \n<br> Also I'm pretty sure I've lost the little pin that goes through the ball at the o\n<br> Bottom of the gear stick, any idea where I could get one ?\n<br> \n<br> Apart from a couple of the shuttlecock bushes for three rods, is there anything else I need to make changing gear smoother. \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Jason\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1104589.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">[/quote]",
