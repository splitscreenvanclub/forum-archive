    "content" : "Here's the story of our clone Devon interior... I hope it's of interest to some of you.\n<br>\n<br>Well, Devon interiors are hard to come by in Australia, and particularly in Western Australia (though i know of one, and a canterbury pitt)... so we decided to make our own. Having owned an awesome '73 Devon in the UK and then living in a '75 Aussie Campmobile for 6 months we had a pretty clear idea on what would suit our mode of camping and the climate over here. Not really following one model of Devon but collating different ideas from over the many different years\n<br>\n<br>Still, this was a difficult process to do in isolation given that all we had to go on was this website, Dave Eccles' excellent camper interiors book, and our memories of our UK bus (plus measurements supplied by the subsequent owner - thanks Bill!). Oh, plus the poor availability of parts - this has been our labour of love.\n<br>\n<br>This is what we started with... a junk back seat, basically.... a blank canvas\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3647/3485993592_4f959cb330.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We mocked up various different cardboard interiors to see what might work best... here's one that didnt make it:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3651/3485495591_e94a7a8a9a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Floor vinyl goes down over ply and foam (for sound-deadening)\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3485994096_e76253b142.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">ROCK AND ROLL BED</span>\n<br>Rear seat 3/4width rock n roll bed carcass\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3397/3485179471_4d8b588566.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I worked out the mechanism geometry on graph paper to give us the correct height bed (level with the engine bay roof) and then Pasha welded up the frame for us:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3485179615_2bedf7b96e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The finished bed with boards and latching hinges (the only part of the previous interior re-used)\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3349/3486003204_6ca7a77483.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">COOKER CABINET</span>\n<br>Have always loved the idea of swing-out cookers, and didnt want to put the cooker next to the RnR bed because it makes the seat cushions smell of food (not cool when thats where your head lies when you sleep!)\n<br>\n<br>Took a LOT of work and measuring to get to this basic stage:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3367/3485179831_720cb46f19.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Cooker and gas bottle location:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3598/3485180013_82ffbe3a94.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Mock-up with hinge post - a very difficult piece to make (thanks Dad!):\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3485995010_770b142232.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Et Voila!

I have no idea if this is the 'correct' way to make a cabinet because i'd never attempted anything like this before but it seemed to work (and allowed for disassembly and reassembly easily):\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3646/3485996558_40dbaca9b2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I'm using a combination of 12mm and 15mm exterior grade (waterproof) ply by the way ('A' face outwards, 'C' face inwards)\n<br>\n<br>The (almost) finished product, complete with bluebird customs buddy seat (again brought over on a plane in a suitcase, thanks Mum this time!!).

My original Devon interior is coming back from the cabinet maker this weekend who has been refinishing it (i.e replacing all the chipped and split wood), so this has got me all excited. You should post this on dsk, as I'm sure some of the Aussie boys would be interested in your overhead locker. \n<br>\n<br>Do you have any plans or drawings for your interior? \n<br>\n<br>Finally, I didn't realise you converted your bus from a panel van to a windowed bus.
