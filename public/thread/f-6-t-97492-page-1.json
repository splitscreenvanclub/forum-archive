Two spoon handles or similar proper tools levered into the recess between the inner and outer window seals gradually widening the gap and pushing firmly and evenly on the glass until it gives. Didn't cut any seals (or beeak any glass) but not necessarily for the feint hearted. Taped windows too air raid style for a bit of grip/safety). \n<br> Sure they will be a more technical and proper answer but that's what us cowboys did.",
