    "content" : "Good project for sale, it is nice strait bus with good no rust cargo doors, front doors, rear hatch. Roof in excellent condition. Both battery trays are original and don't need any welding. Front windshield surounds are good also. Original belly pans. I think it is a realistic couple moths work project and you can have a nice super early dd bus with some features from barndoor. I don't think there is much choice for sale of dd 1956 panels.\n<br> I can weld the bus for you but not strait away, if that helps.\n<br> Price 14k or best offer\n<br> 07411663386 George",
