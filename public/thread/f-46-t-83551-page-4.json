    "content" : "ATM my cooker is fixed but I'm working on making it a swing job. I have remade the roller by freeing up the fibre rollers, turning them down a bit and sleeving them inside an alloy tube, but you could easily use a vinyl roller. I will be putting it back at the correct angle for the lhd bus. The hinge will be a bit different because I want to retain the check strap. The whole unit is about 35mm further towards the back of the bus to allow the bowl flap to clear the B post. \n<br>\n<br>Pleased you like the interior - it was a lot of work but looks great in the old bus. I've tried to keep as much of the patina as I can, inspired by A67MAN's Mk 3 interior. \n<br>\n<br>Just the upholstery to sort now and a few small jobs like putting in the curtain wire along the window bases.",

Make sure you wash it well though. \n<br>\n<br>The upholstery has now been done in my 64 using Ross Fabrics \"Broadway\" in blue, which is quite close to Duracour.

(I figure when screwed to the bulkhead it will be perfectly strong enough!)I then re-veneered the top panel and stuck it all back together- Easy!! \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/973539.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>It has since been varnished but I haven't had a chance to install it in the van due to the rain!!!",

    "content" : "Hi Seth\n<br>The cooker unit looks great \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Never use PVA for veneering - as you found, it distorts the veneer and causes all kinds of grief. Titebond is just right - I use it for most woodworking jobs. You are right about the durability of french polish. It wears quite quickly and doesn't like water or hot tea on it but for appearance you can't beat it. \n<br>\n<br>Don't put the gas bottle in the closed side of your cooker. IMO it's dangerous to do so as you can't get to the bottle quickly and you must turn it off at night. \n<br>\n<br>You seem to have turned the buddy seat at 90 degrees from the original position. That's fine but check that it all works when you make up the bed - you may find the space between the rear seat face and the buddy seat is too wide for the drop down flap. Let us know how you sort it. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks for the reminder - I'll take some pics of the new interior when this effing storm wends its way up country. Had a lively night in Devon - mucho wind and rain \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>\n<br>Brian",
