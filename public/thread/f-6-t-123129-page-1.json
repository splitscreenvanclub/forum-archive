I don't want to run another brake light in the rear window, but would prefer to turn the running lights into brake lights also.\n<br> \n<br> Are there any dual filament bulb holders for barndoors or wolfsburg busses or some sort of conversion?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks.\n<br> \n<br> - jacin\n<br> \n<br> P.S. I am in California and I'm sorry about our President.",

    "content" : "Hey Jim. I'm am going to install the kit this weekend.. but had a couple of questions.\n<br> \n<br> 1) What type of connectors do people typically use when installing the box? Splice connectors? Or is there just a typical spade type connector with a 3-way adapter?\n<br> \n<br> 2) Is there a higher res diagram available? I'm using the one off of the order link (\n<a href=\"http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/prod_1205060-Semaphore-Control-Box-Kit.html\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/prod_120 ... x-Kit.html</a>) but its does not print well obviously.\n<br> \n<br> 3) Where do most mount the control box? I presume near the fuse block in the nose.\n<br> \n<br> 4) For the Left Side Tail light, do most run that down the same path as the main harness?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks super excited!\n<br> \n<br> If anybody wants to see the BD I'm installing on you can find it on my instagram @hoss_vw",
