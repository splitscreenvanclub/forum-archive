    "content" : "Jen bought a similar compressor from an auto jumble where the guy swore blind it was perfect working order.\n<br>\n<br>Got it home, and it would barely create pressure and the motor would continue to run. So I took off that control unit with the four bolts and underneath there's a rubber seal. Jen's had a large hole in it.\n<br>\n<br>Sealey do a repair kit, that has ALL the gaskets and seals in it, but its £30 or something like that. They can't / won't sell it on its own. So we made a seal from a tractor inner tube. Works perfectly now.",
