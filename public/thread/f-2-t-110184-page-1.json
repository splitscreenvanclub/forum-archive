    "content" : "Really appreciate you taking the time to go and look Tony, thanks. Thanks Joe for alerting our resident detective! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The peg/lead was not 'lost' as such, it was pegged in the ground behind our friend's Airstream and we know where it was to within a few feet.\n<br>\n<br>It was still in the ground when our friends left the site at 10AM and had gone by the time we got back from Stanford Hall around 4.30PM. Given where the peg/lead was left, I truly believe that anyone seeing it would have rightly considered it abandoned - and Eddy would probably have appreciated not having to untangle it from his mower the next time he cuts the grass! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Just to reiterate, we'd really appreciate being reunited with this vintage peg (don't care about the lead) - the peg is 50+ years old and is part of the set originally shipped with our Airstream's vintage awning.\n<br>\n<br>I wonder, are there folks here reading this who know others who would have been at Eddy's between those hours who may have innocently picked it up? I appreciate that not everyone reads these forums. We can't make Hangout but if it re-appears, perhaps Eddy could babysit it for us. Failing that, just leave it outside the big shiny Airstream thing - it gets to most south/midlands shows!",
