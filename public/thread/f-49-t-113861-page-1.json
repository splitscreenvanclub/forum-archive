It also has a danburry badge on the boot lid which is original. It was a panel van converted to a camper I was told it was supplied as a flat pack interior and the the van was shipped out to south Africa. Does this make any sense? I have restored the van to a very high standard and would love to know if this is a proper Danbury interior. I have everything curtains,cushions, table,bed it's a complete interior.",
