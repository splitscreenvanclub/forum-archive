    "content" : "Afternoon all,\n<br> \n<br> Trying to help someone out of a tight spot. A contact overseas bought a bus and shipped it over to uk for restoration. All the documentation was sent with the vehicle so the restorer could sort everything out and then ship back overseas when completed.\n<br> \n<br> Trouble is the restorer has gone bust and disappeared, along with all the paperwork. I've got possession of the bus but that's it. I have a VIN number and the M Plate.\n<br> \n<br> Can any of you guys who import regularly give me a step by step as to how I can sort out this mess?\n<br> \n<br> This is not a scam to legitimise a hot vehicle and the story of the resto so far can be seen here :-\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=97088&amp;hilit=cayman+islands&amp;start=135\" class=\"postlink\">https://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic ... &amp;start=135</a>\n<br> \n<br> Any help and guidance gratefully received.",
