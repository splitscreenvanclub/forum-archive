Two slave cylinders per drum should provide more powerful braking than one, right?\n<br>\n<br>Anyone done this?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Mike",

    "content" : "I have no idea BUT on modern cars they fit brake limiters...a ball bearing rolling up a slope caused by deceleration to cut the flow of brake fluid to the rear brakes and prevent them locking up. The brakes are designed to have more stoping power at the front and less at the rear. Hence modern cars with disc brakes at the front and drums at the rear..\n<br>From a personal point of view I upgraded brakes all round on a drum mini but fitting AH sprite bigger bore cyliders in the place of mini ones and that did improve the overall stopping, but i did not change the overall balance..\n<br>\n<br>I do not think it will be possible to do what you want because of the requirement for the hand brake mechanism anyway..\n<br>There may be bigger cylinders on other models to substitute.",

    "content" : "I just want to add my 2 pennies worth to this thread, hopefully in an attempt to prevent someone totalling their bus or even killing themselves.\n<br>\n<br>I've owned my 1960 bus for 6 years and in this time I've resisted the urge to go to dual circuit....preferring to stay stock where possible...BIG MISTAKE!!! Last week, coming down a very steep hill in a residencial area I had total break failure....hit the pedal and nothing, gaining speed I tried the hand brake (adjusted properly), also nothing.....dropped down to first, big screech of the tyres but still unable to stop.....Beeping my horn frantically at the woman doing a 3 point turn 50m ahead of me, she got out of the way just in time....my 19 yr old son had the passenger door open ready to bail. Fortunately the road levelled out and amazingly we eventually came to a stop without hitting anything. It was only after that it dawned on me how lucky we were......2 minutes later we would have been on a main road and maybe even a high speed carriageway. So needless to say we are in the process of fitting a dual circuit M/C.\n<br>\n<br>What is interesting is how this happened and I wonder if anyone has had a similar experience. The rear brakes are less than 4k miles old and on inspection the linings on one of the rears had separated from the shoes, creating a gap big enough for the wheel cylinder to expand beyond it's limits and leak fluid - hence why the hand brake did bugger all. The linings have plenty of meat on them but they were glued in place by 5 or 6 dots of glue. We cleaned everything up and they are now riveted in place. All parts came from VW Heritage.\n<br>\n<br>M/C is going on today plus spacer etc etc.\n<br>\n<br>Has anyone experienced similar problems with nearly new shoes and is there a particular brand that we should be buying, that are either riveted on or secured with a decent quantity of glue? And finally if you are still running a single circuit M/C, change it before you drive your bus again otherwise it's only a question of time before your sharing a similar story and likely with far more severe consequences.\n<br>\n<br>BTW....1960 bus with IRS rear end and Bay 68/69 rear brakes.",
