    "content" : "Many thanks for all that good info. I thought there was some bits missing! I don't suppose I'll find those shaped edging strips. Will end up making those but I don't really want to strip the wood on the case as I prefer the original finish but I'll do my best to match it on the side strips.\n<br>I'm also looking for any pics of what they installed into a walk-through behind the driver seat on a RHD. I know I'll never be able to have an original look bearing in mind that I have a full width bed. I'm trying to get a table and an opposing seat arrangement and making it all work if you see what I mean but I'll have a better Idea when I fit the floor!",

    "content" : "The bar at the bottom of your cooker is the same as I have on mine. If you have the original cargo floor have a look underneath and about 10\" back from,the front bulkhead and 6\" in from the cargo doors is there a square section about the size of a cigarette packet cut out or repaired? This would have been the top up for the under floor water tank on a Pitt. Also check on the M-plate to,see what it came with as most vans for conversion would have been supplied as a Kombi (van with windows) and nothing in the back. Also rhd headlamps and quite probably no battery (something to do with shipping?) \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
