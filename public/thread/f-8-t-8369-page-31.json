But not sure where they would fit into our design. Also, I'd need them now \n  <img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink\"> And we have been kindly gifted an old 50's door that is basically a Crittall pattern but in wood. It should be good for letting loads of light into the workshop area as well. \n  <br>\n  <br>Also, there are obviously security issues with using old door and windows, but the garage is in our back garden, and only accessible from locked 8ft gates between me and our neighbours houses.\n  <br>\n  <br>Current doodles ...\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/rjfuX8\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8660/16615445085_3342d3d883_b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/rjfuX8\" class=\"postlink\">Garage layout ideas</a> by \n  <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/people/29051501@N08/\" class=\"postlink\">zombikombi1959</a>, on Flickr\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Loving the 'doodles' Mike, good luck with the project.\n<br>\n<br>As said above, it would be very handy if you could reverse the bus into the garage and gain good clear access to the engine bay, especially in winter when you are able to close the doors and keep the weather out. Its also a lot easier if you start something and then are able to leave the bus etc in position till the next time you are able to carry on, saves having to clear away each time. \n<br>\n<br>Failing that, some sort of entrance canopy may be good so at least you can roll the van forward enough to be able to work in and around the engine bay under cover, perhaps something that can be added at a later date and not look out of place?",
