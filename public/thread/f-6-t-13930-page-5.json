Its coupled to a pair of wagenswest dropped BJ spindles. \n<br> \n<br>As stated above, they do add track to the front, so the inset isn't as much as youd expect on a 4\" narrowed beam, however its enough to stop the dog legs getting hammered. Here's a pic that kind of shows the inset: \n<br> \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.muchos.co.uk\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://muchos.co.uk/members/monkeybus/20012007110.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a> \n<br> \n<br>Compare it to my mates K&amp;L beam which is also narrowed by 4\"'s and fitted with dropped spindles. \n<br> \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.muchos.co.uk\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://muchos.co.uk/members/monkeybus/RIMG0318.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a> \n<br> \n<br>You can see the difference, although the offset of the raders may not be helping my case. \n<br> \n<br>The combination of spindles and adjustersis the way to go. It always has been. Most will tell you that adjusters alone can make the ride too harsh. \n<br> \n<br>My issue is that at the moment, the adjusters don't need to be wound up too high, so the shift rod fouls the bottom adjuster nut. I'm SA-ing the bus this month, so I'll be able to drop the front a bit more which should lift the nut out of the way. Hopefully this will cure the problem.",
