    "content" : "Hi there,\n<br>\n<br>I have just joined this week after years of looking for the right splitty bus!! Saw your mail and thought I might respond. I have a Bay-Split, we did the conversion about 8 years ago now, and it took an absolute age to get the look right. The Bay-Split kits were fantastic but when you are fitting to a curved window of the bay it does not fit correctly. The wiper motors are located in the top of the screens and I ended up putting two motors in to cure the strain issue that you get. There is also a pretty large overhang on the front end by approx 3 inches over the original front and as a result you cannot drop the front end as you will scrape the front on any high speedbumps!! I am now looking at a a gas system to get me another 3/4 inches, now that sounds rude!\n<br>\n<br>Other than that!!!!!!! It is different and rare but I have had a lot of scorn to what I did to my 73 Bay!! Having said that she is a devon and has much more space than a splitty which is good for our family when camping. I could post some pics of mine if others dont mind? \n<br>\n<br>To get it right it is not a cheap option.\n<br>\n<br>Gaz",
