    "content" : "This 1954 RHD Standard Microbus was imported on 8th April 1954 into VW Motors in London. \n<br>\n<br>It was ordered without seats for a Mr John Garden of Inverurie Scotland. John Garden fabricated the camping interior, the quality of the interior is evident by the fact it still functions perfectly today. The factory installed wool headliner looks as fresh as it did in 1954. \n<br>\n<br>The bus remained in John's ownership until 1975 when it was sold to a market gardener called Mr D.Simpson who used it daily until 1981 when it was purchased by VW enthusiast Brian Coupland, it has passed on a number of times until my ownership in Feb 2013 and I have full documented history of every owner and letters of history and stories from each of them. \n<br>\n<br>The bus underwent a major strip down of the underside in winter 2013 by Ben Lewis (AKA Evil Ben), the metal work was blasted, every original Kamax bolt was acid dipped and black plated. The tranaxle and front beam were fully overhauled and a month correct 1954 barndoor motor was rebuilt and installed, the only non-stock addition being the Speedwell supercharger to help with the hills. \n<br>\n<br>The bus comes complete with its 5 original date matched stock wheels and every piece of glass is the original Sekurit logoed type. Someone has fitted safari windows, but I have both pieces of original Sekurit front glass. \n<br>\n<br>This is an amazing timewarp bus, with full documented history and ready to drive anywhere. It goes without saying that these buses in this condition and steeped in this level of history rarely hit the open market. In fact I drove it only today to take these pictures and I love it, but unfortunately another project means I have to pass this on to the next custodian. \n<br>\n<br>Price is Â£59,000 ovno\n<br>\n<br>Additional photos \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s659.photobucket.com/user/ianmac2009/library/Bus%20for%20sale/54%20Barndoor%20additional%20pictures\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://s659.photobucket.com/user/ianmac2009/library/Bus%20for%20sale/54%20Barndoor%20additional%20pictures</a>\n<br>\n<br>For serious enquiries please call Ian 07748924444",
