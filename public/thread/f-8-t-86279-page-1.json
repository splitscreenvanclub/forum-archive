    "content" : "This started off 4 years ago by buying a 1966 bus with no engine and some shoody running gear and then convincing my wife that spending £3500 importing a 1966 2.0L 911 engine and 501 box from the US (thanks Paul P911GUY on Pelican parts forum). Since then a baby and building a garage to do the project in has taken priority but its now back on the drawing board. The worst part of having that time away was that the mind does wander and now i am toying with the 964 running gear idea. Obviously there is going to be a fair amount of fabrication to get round and not least on the front chassis/suspension, as rightly pointed out by Bobley, but why the hell not. It will only add about £15 to the build (if you look at my log in name you will understand why this has gone in!)\n<br> \n<br> So post one of..........................................................",

As well as the 964 running gear and drive train i could also use the 993 variant as a donor as most parts are interchangeable. \n<br> \n<br> All i need to do now is fine the donor parts from a source that doesn't add a premium onto some rusty parts because it has porsche written on it!
