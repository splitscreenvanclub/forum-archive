    "content" : "Anyone out there getting a bit to prescious with there Buses? I,ve got an unrestored Westy that I,ve had for I think 7 years when I first bought it it was pricey but far cheaper than anything around today and I quite happily used to use it a lot through winter when it rained through summer etc. One of the reasons i bought it was the condition of the under carriage and particularly the under arches which have lovely shiney original paint gleaming out which are far to nice to be covered in waxoyle or any other treatment but there in lies the problem you start to get far to picky about when the Bus comes out to play and then theres the genuine early Fuches I,ve put on which as much as I love them do take some lookin after and these days I,m far less inclined to spend hours minting my Bus up. So heres the dilemna I think I,d rather have a shabby but solid bus which I could take out every day rather than the Bus I own now which only comes out when it,s dry but I find myself unable to let go of my bus because I won,t find better of course if I lived in California it wouldn,t be an issue it,d be driven every day",
