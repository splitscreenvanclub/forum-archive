Propane/butane is heavy so flows along the floor and in theory through the hole to escape.\n<br> My Devon had the bottle there in 1964 I have just added the Heater and cut off valves etc.\n<br> Works great for me. Most Devon Caravettes after 1963 have the gas bottle inside.\n<br> Early RHD Devons had the gas bottle in the engine compartment on the passenger side on the bottle tray..\n<br> Needs to be secured and strapped as well. Some use a hard foot to keep bottle in place plus a strap.\n<br> G",

I drew round the bottom collar of the gas bottom onto a piece of 18mm MDF. I then drew a larger circle round that approx 30mm away from the inner circle. Cut along both lines with a jig saw making a \"hoop\". The hoop was then drilled through and bolted to the left hand tray. All waterproofed underneath and away you go. The hoop secures it in one spot perfectly. Then attach a strap to the \"hoop\" which goes over your gas bottle. \n<br> \n<br> Hth",
