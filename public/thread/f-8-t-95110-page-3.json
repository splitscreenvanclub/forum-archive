Your A-post repairs are a lot neater than mine! \n<br>\n<br>I have noticed Schofield's being out in a few places and I'm starting to lean towards Autocraft. The best panel I had from Schofield's was in the inner valance, but that come with Autocraft stickers on it - reselling I guess.\n<br>\n<br>I'm confused when you say the lower panel wraps round the headlights - you don't seem to have gone that far up?\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n <div>\n  <cite>jonthebuilder wrote:</cite>Also my lower font panel will also sit higher than the bottom of the inner valence when fitted.. Don't know why but I'm going to blend the step with a skim of filler so it won't be seen..\n  <br>\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Looking at some of the builds I think this is common.
