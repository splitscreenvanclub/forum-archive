    "content" : "After a baron spell with nothing air cooled I thought it was time to buy something to tinker with at the weekend! I set myself a budget to buy an Oval, had always wanted one and whilst I have owned 3 Beetles they were all later cars! I set my friend Dave (Bally) a task of finding a good car (he seems to always find things that I can't \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> ) After looking at a number of nice cars on a number of forums, Dave sent me an email to say that he had found a car on the Samba. I sent an e mail and held my breath....I never get responses from the Samba. I got a response and organised to drive to Bath to see the 1956 (57 Model) Oval. I drove to Bath expecting the worse.....and was pleasantly surprised when I was greeted by a very 'honest' Oval that was 90% original and had the benefit of a rag top and black with red interior (the combination I was looking for)\n<br>\n<br>I agreed a price with the owner and had to wait over a week to organise collection. During this time I must of questionned myself 100 times as to whether it was as nice as I had originally seen. I enlisted the help of a member of my team, thanks Johnny the Trailer, and we set off to Bath to collect Oscar.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures008-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures002-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures004-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>What a good looking chap! And also proof that contrary to popular belief I dont just push a pen! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>Some of you may know that I am lucky enough to have a big workshop and MOT testing facilities at my disposal......so the first thing to do was book Oscar in for an MOT. He failed! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> Hardly surprising as he hadnt been on the road in the UK for 3 years almost and was still sporting the shipping writing on the windscreen. The failure was headlamps out of alignment, play in the steering box, osr foot brake and handbrake inefficient and horn not working.......not bad for a car thats 53 years old! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures032-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures033-2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures022-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures023-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>A hitch hiker! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_clown.gif\" alt=\":clown:\" title=\"clown\"> \n<br>\n<br>Today I rolled up my sleeves and got to work on the remedial works needed for the MOT. I adjusted the rear brakes, adjusted the steering box, fixed the horn (bad connection) and adjusted the headlamps.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i33.photobucket.com/albums/d96/g4rfy/Pictures034-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>The best bit and now the worst bit! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br>A Porsche 912 engine......hidden under the deck lid!\n<br>\n<br>I reversed Oscar out of the brake rollers and was happy that he had passed his retest and was just about to receive his MOT certificate. I heard a funny noise from the engine and quickly shut it off. I then checked there was oil still in the engine and made sure all was tight. It was, so I tried to start him again.......he was flat......or was he seized! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>I turned the alternator to see if that was seized.....all free.....so closed my eyes and prayed and turned the engine over with an enormous spanner......it turned through 355 degrees and then stopped.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> After a major dose of tourettes.......I came to the conclusion that hopefully \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> there has been some sort of failure with the valve gear......all ideas and advice gratefully recieved \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>I have plans for Oscar and I will keep you updated with progress.......first job to see why hes seized!\n<br>\n<br>I will keep you updated!\n<br>\n<br>G4",
