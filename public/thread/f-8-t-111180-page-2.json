Really looking forward to see it installed on the bus.\n<br>\n<br>Also, my 6 months secondment abroad are almost over - 3 weeks to go \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">\n<br>Once I'm back I will be sure to post some pictures of the progress. I haven't heard any news from my dad, but then again I've been pretty busy with work lately.\n<br>\n<br>One question for you guys. \n<br>I would like to know where I can perhaps find out the original manufacture date/ details for my bus... a certificate of sorts perhaps? I know she is a pre-October 58 bus, but nothing more specific. What/ where can I get it? (Really appreciate any help I get)\n<br>\n<br>I will keep you all updated once I'm back home in Malta and can give out regular updates \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Take care.\n<br>\n<br>James",
