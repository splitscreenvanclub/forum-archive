    "content" : "I have recently installed a 123ignition tune+ and I would love to know what maps others are using for a 1600 dual port with the vacuum connected to a PICT 34. Here’s what I’m using, and here’s an image of the dashboard when cruising. I’m finding tick-over super smooth and I feel much more able to adjust the carb, but while it’s much better overall than the £50 009 I ditched, I’m still down on power compared to how the engine has been at its best. Compression test ok, Valve clearances checked, carb serviced, new coil, leads and plugs on the way to trying to improve performance.\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=36364&amp;sid=7ebcb27080387b075c00f0cfac181750&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=36364&amp;t=1&amp;sid=7ebcb27080387b075c00f0cfac181750\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"226CFC75-A17C-47D9-B755-50BDD363666D.png\" title=\"226CFC75-A17C-47D9-B755-50BDD363666D.png (258.41 KiB) Viewed 2699 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=36363&amp;sid=7ebcb27080387b075c00f0cfac181750&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=36363&amp;t=1&amp;sid=7ebcb27080387b075c00f0cfac181750\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"147B3B6E-B4AC-4EC0-855B-08B4681AA178.png\" title=\"147B3B6E-B4AC-4EC0-855B-08B4681AA178.png (112.48 KiB) Viewed 2699 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",

The App makes it possible to adjust the ignition curve and shows an electronic dashboard. Main features: REV-counter, Anti-theft system, Bluetooth 4.0, Real time tuning, Vacuum advance, Boost retard, Soft REV-limiter, etc.\n<br> \n<br> Ideally suited to high performance VW aircooled engines replaces 009 or 031 distributors with vacuum, with high performance ignition system with adjustable advance curve and bluetooth technology. These VW performance distributor are the top of the range distributors being used today by most VW performance engine builders. Great for VW Beetle, Bus, Buggy, Porsche. simple to install adjustable advance curves.“\n<br> \n<br> It’s a great bit of kit and all the mechanical advance and vacuum are performed electronically so the only moving part is the rotor shaft. It times absolutely perfect.\n<br> It even measures the oil temperature which can be monitored on the phone.\n<br> Simon",
