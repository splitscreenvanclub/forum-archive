The front line is fitted to one of the rear ports. There are 2 brake light switches one in the front port and one in the rear\n </div>\n</blockquote> For the US-spec setup with two brake switches, two Tees are needed. One Tee goes at the rear and bolts to the transmission horns to split the long line from one of the front ports that serves the rear circuit. A brake switch is fitted in the other front port. A second Tee is used to split the front circuit from one of the rear ports because the other front circuit (rear) port is occupied by a second brake switch. I mounted that second Tee to the rear of the front crossmember when I converted mine.\n<br> \n<br> I didn't know there was any difference between US and Euro spec, but Heritage's page says there was. The Euro-spec version only used one brake switch on on the front ports serving the rear circuit, so both rear ports serving the front circuit are free and plumb direct to each wheel and an extra Tee is not needed.",
