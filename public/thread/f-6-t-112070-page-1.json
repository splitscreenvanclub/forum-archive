    "content" : "Hi\n<br>\n<br>Out and about today the truck started diving hard to the right under braking - enough to pull the steering wheel out of my hand as I braked. Came straight home and noticed that the right hand front drum was a lot warmer than the left, so I put the truck in the garage (huge f***-up - see below) and checked the brakes. The right brakes seemed to be rubbing, so I backed the adjusters off, but the rubbing wouldn't stop, so I pulled the front drums and again, nothing obviously wrong. On reassembly, however, the left hand drum spins freely, while the right hand doesn't and the rubbing sound persists even with the brake adjusters backed fully off. I put chalk on the friction surface and rotated the drum, but there's no evidence that the shoes are contacting the drum, so I don't think the noise is the brakes rubbing.\n<br>\n<br>Does that sound like bearings? There isn't any of the usual play I'd expect with bearings, nor any grumbling sounds, just the sandy rubbing sound and that the drum doesn't spin freely. The bearings look pristine (no scoring on the outer taper bearings etc), but the inner bearing does seems quite loose. Is that normal?\n<br>\n<br>If it's bearings, JK do a kit, which looks to be the simplest option, but does that contain everything I need? The bearings look like they sit in polished bushes. Do I need those as well? I can't find anywhere that lists them?\n<br>\n<br>And the f***-up? I screwed up badly - I'd unloaded the truck and was so distracted by the pulling problem, I forgot to shut the treasure chest door before pulling in to the garage. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I've torn the rearmost hinge mostly out.

    "content" : "Bolted everything back up in the week and adjusted the shoes as I'd received a new carb and needed to test run it.\n<br>\n<br>I pressed the brakes once and it pulled hard to the left (opposite of before), but then settled down and was stopping dead straight, even under hard braking. Everything was running fine, so I carried on using the truck. After about 10 miles of local driving and frequent braking however, the pull to the right started to come back. I might have been imagining it, but it felt like it pulled more noticeably under gentle braking than under heavy. When I got home, there was a smell of hot brakes (like the smell you get if you leave the handbrake on \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> ) and the right hand front wheel was noticeably warmer than the left, which felt normal. Rears both felt normal too.\n<br>\n<br>I'm becoming more convinced this is a brake issue. Does that fit with the symptoms? What diagnosis can I do next? I've pulled the drum and everything looks fine inside. The shoes open and retract as I'd expect when the pedal is pumped. The hard and soft brake lines were all new over the winter, as was the master cylinder (I converted to dual circuit) and the left front and right-rear cylinders (the former were seized and the latter I damaged replacing the hub seal).\n<br>\n<br>The issue only seems to affect the right-hand front. \n<br>\n<br>I thought when I installed the RH front hard line that one of the bends was a bit tight, but having had another look at the weekend and going back over the pictures that I took, I can't see anything that looks wrong. I couldn't identify which bend I might have been concerned about at the time.\n<br>\n<br>Any ideas?",

I had to replace the left front over the winter as they'd seized, but the right front seemed fine.

So everything of the brake system seems ok now. Went for a long drive and problem didn't seem to appear but the same wheel is slightly warmer than the near side one. There is no binding as far as I can tell and no rubbing of any parts. Will have a longer drive this weekend to see how the heat build up is within the drum. I suppose if there is still build up of heat it might be the bearings which generate the heat.\n<br>\n<br>Hope this will give you something to work with as well. \n<br>Let us know how you get on with changing the cylinders.\n<br>\n<br>Gertjan",
