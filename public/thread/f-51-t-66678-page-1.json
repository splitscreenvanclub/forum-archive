    "content" : "We are likely to have to sell on our Split project and as the Bristol show is nearly here and we are not toooo far from there this is a 'possibly for sale' thread.\n<br>\n<br>The resto is started and we have spent a fair bit of money having the welding done. There is still some welding to do and it will require a fair bit of time and effort to then get roadworthy, but it is RHD!\n<br>\n<br>check out the resto thread ... \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=57679&amp;p=510333#p510333\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=57679&amp;p=510333#p510333</a> \n<br>\n<br>and if you would like any further info or to come and see it please let me know.\n<br>\n<br>In order to meet requirements of putting values on for sale threads I'm going to say Â£10k ono ... but emphasis on 'ono'!\n<br>\n<br>I do have most parts and plenty of extra bits to finish the project. This would be ideal if you can do the work yourself.\n<br>\n<br>The van is garaged near Gloucester (just off J11 of the M5).\n<br>\n<br>...\n<br>The resto thread should tell most of the story, but\n<br>\n<br>1966 RHD ... believed to be a Canterbury Pitt, although the only evidence of this now is the roof aperture!\n<br>\n<br>Work done so far:\n<br>\n<br>Front roof section replaced with a donor section off a South African bus.\n<br>Passengerside A pillar replaced with a NOS part\n<br>Passenger front step/arch replaced (although not fully welded yet) with a new repro full arch (Schofields I think)\n<br>Passenger B pillar replaced with a new repro Klassic Fab part (the good old green stuff!)\n<br>Lower bulkhead repaired repro inner arch closers and fabricated lower bulkhead section\n<br>Tophat sections and sills (both sides) replaced with new repro parts\n<br>Full cargo floors replaced with new/repro panels (Cool Air / Schofield??)\n<br>Shortside panel and lower C pillar and strengtheners replaced with NOS panel (can't beat NOS!!)\n<br>Gutter section above side cargo doors replaced with donor section\n<br>\n<br>To do:\n<br>Front panel / valance / screen pillars - repair or replace depending on your preference / skills.\n<br>For this I have a new repro front panel (JK), inner and outer valance panels (Schofields) and a donor dash and windscreen pillar section. (Dash is LHD so pillars will need to be unpicked) The LHD dash is very good so could be sold on. Radio section is uncut I think!\n<br>\n<br>Rear corner (passengerside) - lots of filler here so needs replacing to do the NOS shortside some justice! I have a donor section from an early bay. This is complete from top to bottom. The lower skin has been cut off so the remainder can be sold on. \n<br>\n<br>The other rear corner has some filler so could be replaced at a later date.\n<br>\n<br>The cargo doors need repairs to the bottom section but are definitely worth saving. Also included is another set of cargo doors - never been welded but do need it!\n<br>\n<br>Wiring loom needs replacing, but a new Rocket loom is included.\n<br>\n<br>Also included is a Dormie roof from a bay complete with supports and canvas (original so may be a little tired!) and 2 sets of bunks!\n<br>\n<br>Front seats (1+2) are tatty but structurally sound. There is another '2' seat and half of a '1' seat! both tatty but sound.\n<br>\n<br>There is no furniture for the rear so a blank canvas for fitting out however you want.\n<br>\n<br>Also included is a 1776 engine from a beetle. Not yet fitted to the bus. Turns over by hand ok. This is a 12v set up.\n<br>I also have a 1200cc engine and various 6v parts.\n<br>\n<br>There is a 12v starter.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is on stock running gear so RBs. The van moves freely. There is a spare gearbox complete with RBs.\n<br>\n<br>All glass is present but not fitted. The original pop out frames (2 only) are probably shot, but I have 2 complete original popouts in excellent condition and 1 other in above average condition.\n<br>\n<br>The van is sitting on 15inch wheels but I also have 2 sets of 14 inch wheels (4 x wide 5 and 4 x late bay)\n<br>2 sets of front RHD lights (1 standard and 1 American spec)\n<br>\n<br>As said I believe there is pretty much everything needed to get the van on the road and you can have all parts that I have.\n<br>\n<br>Time to move on\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">\n<br>Regards\n<br>Martin",
