In my defence, the rear wheel was sat in a rain gutter in our work car park. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://www.limejam.co.uk/images/bus/xzorst.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Next jobs, make the interior sleepable in and fit the remaining seatbelt (driver's side) before Stanford. \n<br> \n<br> I'm changing the front wheel bearings this week as they're a bit noisy. I don't know why I didn't do it first time as everything else is new! Then I have to see why it's over-heating. I suspect the timing is still out, although I could do with finding a rolling road to make sure it's all running well and the carbs are set up properly.\n<br> \n<br> Then we're off to Devon on OCD! Can't wait, that's what it's all been about, stuff like that!",
