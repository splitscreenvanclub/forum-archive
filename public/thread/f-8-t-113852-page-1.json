    "content" : "Some of you may have seen this on Facebook , but I reckon here is a much better place to keep the resto thread.\n<br>About six years ago I found about about this bus &amp; it took 6 months to get the owner to agree for me to view it, I took along Bigbulli, as its not something you see everyday, so knew he would be interested. I wanted to buy it then , however the owner didn't want to part with it, as he knew, if he let it go, the chances of getting another were very unlikely. Throughout the years that followed I kept in contact with the owner &amp; finally he was up for a deal, typically the time wasn't quite right for me to buy it alone, but my good mate Dick Hindle , who works along side me at Resto Haus, was as keen as I was to take custody, so we decided to buy it as a shared project. We borrowed an old Jeep from one mate &amp; a trailer from another, got the cash together &amp; set off early one morning to pick up our prize.\n<br>Its a 1963 Container bus, which was built in Australia for only their market, according to David Eccles only 123 were ever built &amp; its believed only 17 still survive world wide &amp; just 4 in the UK. One was originally used as \"Chilli gone barmy\", selling Mexican food, which now lives about an hour from us. Another is selling coffee &amp; trades as \"The Camper Coffee Co\", again based in the west country in Exeter, the 3rd only arrived in this country in March of this year &amp; like ours is in need of restoration &amp; based in Norfolk. Then lastly ours which you'll see in the pictures, is in need of a little tlc, which we will display on here for all to see, though don't expect speedy progress as fitting our own projects in between customers is never easy.\n<br>Here is a picture I found from when it was in Oz\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s265.photobucket.com/user/BO-JANGLES_photos/media/Container%20bus/C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved%20Images_imagesEP261E07_zpsmxlnewfy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii207/BO-JANGLES_photos/Container%20bus/C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved%20Images_imagesEP261E07_zpsmxlnewfy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
