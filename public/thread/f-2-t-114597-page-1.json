    "content" : "if you are interested in joining us on the 7th Oldtimers Cruize Devon, \"THE HOT ONE\" please read below.....\n<br> \n<br> as normal this is for pre 67 style vw splitscreen busses ONLY......and yet again cause of the style of event it needs to be from START TO FINISH... . i am aiming this event at all types of us...... single, couples and families etc... so what i have been trying to do is get us all catered for. the cruize will include some good pubs that do good food, clean campsite (showers etc..) a good view, hopefully some dry weather, maybe another good pub, maybe a sea view, all with good likeminded people that enjoy their own and other split busses and all in devon..... can you just imagine 30 busses cruizin around and through the devon hills and villages.... im sure you can!!!\n<br> \n<br> criteria.... it would be wise to have your bus all serviced up ( there are some entertaining roads, narrow with no place to stop, steep hills up and down..), all of which i am more than happy driving my bus up and down . mums and dads are responsible for their own children and the dogs... the cruize is all about start to finish, so you would need to be able to participate from start to finish (thurs 26th may @ 2.26pm till monday 30th may).\n<br> \n<br> what is Oldtimers Cruize Devon XVI all about....\n<br> \n<br> meet junction 27 on m5 at 2.26pm \n<br> thursday 26th (with a full tank of fuel) we will leave junction 27 M5 then cruize to a campsite , where we will pitch up for one night (some elec available) bar and restaurant near site. so after a long day on the road you can let your hair down..(remember we are back on the road in the morning).\n<br> \n<br> fri morning aim to leave site 10.00am we all will then cruize some more, taking in some great views and some interesting lanes (very picturesque). we will spend a long part of the day at on the road with a few stops and quite picturesque....then head to our second campsite, basic with showers, this site has a pub near by....\n<br> sat morning aim to leave 10.30am , a steady drive onto the next site (all together) via a supermarket and a fuel stop... this site we will stay here for 2 nights. (good campsite facilities, hot shower etc.). once we have all pitched up, the way i see it is you do your own thing, there are a few good pubs and restaurants around . \n<br> \n<br> sunday morning, well this year is gona be a little different.... it'll be a surprise for me as well as you!! after which we will head back to site for maybe a tasty beverage.. or 2.... and just remember you will have to dive home come monday...\n<br> \n<br> hope you understand and like all the above......\n<br> \n<br> i still enjoy doing this event, as i feel this is what our vehicles were designed for but it would not be half as much fun if the rest of you were not also there, so yet again i have been haggling to keep the price real!!! as things are still tight for all of us.\n<br> \n<br> now for the not so exciting bit..... i know funds are tight, and with an event like this we all have fuel, food, beer and general expenses on top of ticket price. so i have tried to keep it down to a minimum ( considering it's a bank hol weekend), the price is per split screen bus, ( 2 adults and up to 3 children) for 4 nights camping . £98.00 same as last year...\n<br> \n<br> NOTE...now im not into disclaimers or t's and c's.... but need to say that this event is all paid up front for all your sites etc...this way i get the deal with them as i do, and that allows me to enjoy it as much as you!!! so if you do not make it for one reason or another... there will NOT be any refund....\n<br> \n<br> PLEASE READ.....\n<br> make sure you can do the WHOLE event before you register please...\n<br> if you are still interested and want to be a part of the O.C.D XVI and if you have friends with a split that you wish to join us, you and them need to email me with a subject heading “OCD XVI im in” to register.....inc your details ( how many in your bus, names, bus year, reg, ssvc aka and whether you would like electric if available). there are only 30 spaces available (including mine). once you have registered, and if your one of the first 30, you will get an email to tell you how to pay and this will also confirm you are on-board!!\n<br> \n<br> as last year i was able to sort participants T shirts.... so if you would like one or more, these need to be paid for with your entrance fee... you need to tell me what size and gender you would like when you register. these are £9 each\n<br> \n<br> info needed in the registration is..\n<br> \n<br> 1 names of all participants (adults and children)\n<br> 2 reg of vehicle and year (as normal pre 67 splitscreen only)\n<br> 3 whether you would like elec if its available\n<br> 4 your ssvc aka ( user name)\n<br> 5 t shirts size and gender (if you want one?)\n<br> \n<br> registration email \n<a href=\"mailto:buzz54@btinternet.com\">buzz54@btinternet.com</a> \n<br> \n<br> this event is first come first on board!!! so if you want to get on board, get registered!!!..i will go through the emails in order they come in..\n<br> \n<br> cheers buzz and maz look forward to seeing you all soon.",
