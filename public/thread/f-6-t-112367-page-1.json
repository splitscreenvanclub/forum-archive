    "content" : "So I've narrowed down this rattle that's been bugging me for a few days.\n<br>It starts when I take my foot off the accelerator and goes when I accelerate.\n<br>It doesn't always rattle, more so when it's been out for a run.\n<br>But I got back home and it was ticking away more than usual.\n<br>When I pull on the fan shroud it seems to stop.\n<br>If I push the alternator it seems to stop.\n<br>When I let go again it starts.\n<br>So my guess is that the fan is catching inside the shroud?\n<br>(Engine has been out recently)\n<br>Any suggestions or confirmations greatly appreciated \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raBqxKXmttw\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raBqxKXmttw</a>\n<!-- m -->",

    "content" : "Remove the fanbelt and slacken the screws holding the fan shroud at the sides and the alternator strap and move the fan shroud around a bit - when totally removing the fan shroud it can be a bit of a bugger to get it sitting right again and not catch anywhere. I found sometimes they sit too low, so lift one end up a touch and retighten the screws again. - Its best to spin the fan using the alternator pulley wheel until it doesn't catch.\n<br>\n<br>You'll get it perfect, retighten the alternator strap and it will catch again - LOL it can be a bit of a frustrating job!\n<br>\n<br>You've probably moved it manhandling the engine around/in/out.",
