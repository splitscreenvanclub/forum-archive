Can I run at full stock height with this set up or will I end up with negative camber and will the CV's cope with the angles of the drive shafts? Also I hear that the Creative cradle weld in parts are excellent but if I could help it I'd like to keep the bus as stock as possible so I'm trying to avoid too much cutting. Could I use the boxwagen bolt in kit ( with the early bay stuff) and keep the OG gearbox mounts? Also where to source the boxwagen kit.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers John",
