Lots of surfing if you're in to that.\n<br>We then drove South down the coast of Portugal. Viana do Castelo, Espinho and Aveiro were all quite memorable places.\n<br>Avoid the Algave in peak season. It's absolutely heaving and overpriced compared to other places. \n<br>We drove up through the middle of Spain. Burgos and Pamplona are a must even if you're not into bull torture. Sitting in a Spanish bar during the day with a glass of wine and some Serrano ham and I was in heaven. \n<br>We found that Spain was nice in the cities but there wasn't much to see in between like you would find in small french villages.\n<br>Never saw the south of Spain so cant help there. \n<br>Great trip. Hope you have a great time.",
