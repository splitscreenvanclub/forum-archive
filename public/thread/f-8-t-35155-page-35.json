    "content" : "Im sorry Clinton, i will ring you this week - im so wrapped up in this deadline and trying to get this damn thing done, alot of things have slipped. Poor i know but i will contact you \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br>\n<br>Thanks Ben, Tim.\n<br>\n<br>The bank holiday was a bit of a non event for me as i spent nearly 30 hours working on the van, its like Terminator this van - it never stops. Im nearly 2 weeks to Mot and getting my life back \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> but what seems like an impossible amount of stuff to do.....\n<br>\n<br>The list of small but time consuming jobs continued over the 3 days and i finally got all the cab with the exception of the bulkhead finished. All the beam and steering is now mostly connected, even down to split pins,new grease nipples etc. One set of front brakes in and finished,just the other side to install. Rear brake lines went in too etc etc.....\n<br>Finally got the small welding pieces finished on the drivers wheel arch and that is now ready for top coat (i ran out of paint). I modified up some bolts to match the 3 bolts original bolts for the front bumper and got that bolted on although its fairly twisted still(i will sort later on)\n<br>\n<br>The original front drums had to have some major derusting work as the spare set i had had issues with the rear bearing so i was quicker to sort the originals. That now means i used original everything except the front shocks that the van had when i got it.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway the list went on and on.....\n<br>\n<br>Other wheel arch awaiting paint, centre shift rod to cut to length etc but nearly done. Burnt the paint a little in the corners finally fixing the seal holder channel by the lower door hinge i had forgotton.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC06177.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Pass arch nearly done...\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC06181.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC06182.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>Last thing Monday -Started to try out the repaired controls bits and bobs, seemed to all fit, should get that finished tonight\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/DSC06191_edited.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Wiring Loom will be ready later this week hopefully and will be installed this sunday. Just the Bulkhead panel which fingers crossed will be with me shortly .The engine/clutch will hopefully go in next week as well as the brake flexies, master cycl and the final brake lines up front.\n<br>\n<br>More tonight im afraid \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Mark",
