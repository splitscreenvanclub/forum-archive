It will creep into any gap much better than waxoyl and is very easy to apply being an aerosol with a long cavity tube supplied. I'd paint the underside of the bus rather than coat everything with under seal and then just spray some S50 into the nooks and crannies. Obviously blast all the cavities with the stuff.",
