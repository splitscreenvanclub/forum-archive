Being in Northern Ireland we often get hit with crazy postage inflation (by certain companies - Heritage now started treating us as UK and including NI in free postage for orders over Â£60 - yippee) despite royal mail covering us as UK.\n<br>\n<br>Get an email today from Shelley at Cool Flo to say they noticed my two orders and have put them into one order and refunded the second postage charge. Even asked for me to send them pics of my bug and splittie.\n<br>\n<br>V impressed and would recommend these guys.",

One of the CoolFlo guys noticed our dog was struggling with the heat a little and came over with a bottle of chilled mineral water for him. As above, it wasn't going to earn them any money, it was simply a really nice and decent thing to do, hats off to them.",

Support these guys and buy some kit!!\n<br>\n<br>Other companies over the years who have went out of their way to get me the best postage price include - Stan at caravan-supplies, MadMats, machine7, broomsgrove autotrimers, should include Heritage for including NI as UK in their free postage. Should start a : something positive to say about a vw company thread!!",
