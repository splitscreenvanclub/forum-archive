Just some way of checking and topping up the boxes would be ideal. ...or lazy if you prefer!! \n<br> \n<br> Any tips would be welcome as the alternative seems a long way round for a simple top up.",

    "content" : "I thought this might be the answer...! I suppose given that the gearbox and reduction boxes are linked then it would make sense to jack each side up before draining the reduction boxes. This way there is a chance of reducing the wastage that comes down the axles. Oh well, unless there is a super new idea that comes along, that has confirmed the way forward. Any last wonderful ideas....?",

    "content" : "Just fill the reduction boxes with 0.4 pints each, then the main box up to the filler hole (should be 4.4pints to refill it) and it will equalise with the reduction boxes as they all share the same oil.\n<br> \n<br> If you jack one side up and fill it, it'll just keep taking oil until the main box is completely full of oil (I.e. Too much)\n<br> \n<br> I must admit that when I did mine, after draining all of the oil, I measured the correct amount into each reduction box and the main box for piece of mind.\n<br> \n<br> I found that attaching a length of garden hose to the cap of a 1 litre gearbox oil container.\n<br> , the type with the spout on, then putting the hose end into the filler hole on the main box, which isn't the most accessible place granted, squeeze the bottle to inject it into the trans case, then refill with a measured amount each time and repeat until it's all in.\n<br> \n<br> Warming the oil helps it flow too as the vacuum in the bottle doesn't help matters.\n<br> \n<br> Hope this helps.\n<br> \n<br> Nik. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
