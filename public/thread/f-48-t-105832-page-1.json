I was trying to organise one for Action but little Empi made an appearance in May and it all kinda fell by the wayside (along with sleep, sanity and an easy life \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> ). I'm pretty sure that Brian would be quite amenable to giving space on the show field at Action as he was up for it this year and maybe we could blag Rikki into letting us nudge onto the edge of the ssvc lineup he usually organises at Action \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>In the meantime I will fire up my Spectrum ZX81 and Commodore 64 and see if I can get the hang of this faceache thingy \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee. \n<br>\n<br>Ps, Joop if you're reading this I posted the stickers and stuff off for you on Monday.",
