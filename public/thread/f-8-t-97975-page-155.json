A couple more packages arrived , but more on those in a future update. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2947_zpshlbf7zpv.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2947_zpshlbf7zpv.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>It's Beavers night………. which means I get to have a ……………………..beer \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> ( I know what you were all thinking \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> )\n<br>\n<br>but earlier I did a bit of snagging……. I've been struggling with the rear indicators. I've checked my wiring and that's all correct. The S/H rear units are in good order but a bit corroded, so I spent some time sorting out and cleaning the terminals and making sure there's a good earth. Still nothing at the rear \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> It was looking like the switch might be goosed. I could redirect the power from the main terminal to HR and HL on the switch and it worked. So switch internals………Yesterday I'd come to the decision that I wouldn't bother with using all five wires but would use the power from VR and VL. Today though, I thought I'd have a more \"in depth\" look at the switch \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> There had been a bit of \"chattering\" from the relay now and again so I reasoned that perhaps the switch was dirty rather than broken. I squirted lots of electrical cleaner into it and used the airline to blow it out. Every now and then a rear light lit up \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>So, in order to get at the internals a bit better, I removed a spring (didn't want to bugger it at this stage though. These switches are expensive and I knew I could use it just using the front outputs) Sorry about focus…..\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2948_zpsevxfkfqt.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2948_zpsevxfkfqt.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and then, in for a penny etc. I removed the two smaller springs \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> This meant that all the little levers were more accessible and I was able to get inside with bits of sandpaper to clean the contacts. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2949_zpscxa5kv0e.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2949_zpscxa5kv0e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>An hour or two later and after lots of air and spray and I got it working perfectly \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I put the hazard wires back on and, bingo, they all work \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>Taillights are also working, main beam warning light now works…..on low beam…….. as the new fuse box lacks a terminal where it's needed (on the high beam fuse way) but annoyingly has extra terminals on the low beam fuse ways \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> I'l swop those around…….\n<br>\n<br>I've now got only two faults to rectify………..\n<br>\n<br>The hazards still only work with ignition….I thought I'd sussed that but no………and \n<br>\n<br>the warning light for the indicators only works if it's grounded….and there's no ground on the speedo for the indictor warning light \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> It works by having an ignition switch live to one side and live from the flasher unit to the other. Hence….12v both side…….no current flows and it's not until the indicators are switched on that the bulb loses it's 12v from the flasher unit and lights up, flashing asynchronously with the indicator bulbs……..I think………I'l get my anorak…. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Anyway…….happy with how it's looking.

Can I just take a moment to thank Simon at Red 9 Design? His Company's customer service has been outstanding. I bought a secondhand R9 front end off this forum a couple of years ago. It was still on the pallet and never fitted but there have been changes over time to improve the product. Simon has sent me all the parts to bring it right up to date \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> I have bought a rear unit off him but nevertheless, great customer service \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> So this is a brand new steering column and linkages to replace the previous one….and this one is chromed \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2952_zpsd3bqzj8w.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2952_zpsd3bqzj8w.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So another step backwards to fit the new column and linkage but it was good in the end \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2954_zpsxu7vlfxx.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2954_zpsxu7vlfxx.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and the new column doesn't have a hole for the horn wire so I'll have to go the wireless route with a dash button backup. While I was underneath the bus, I sorted out a post for the Butty's Bits throttle linkage return spring. I think it looks neater than the stainless steel tie clip supplied \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty2/IMAG2953_zpskbn9pf72.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty2/IMAG2953_zpskbn9pf72.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Another day dawned and I seemed to have been awake most of last night thinking about the indicator problem \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sleepy1.gif\" alt=\":sleepy1:\" title=\"sleepy1\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sleepy2.gif\" alt=\":sleepy2:\" title=\"sleepy2\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/sleepy3.gif\" alt=\":sleepy3:\" title=\"sleepy3\"> but this morning I awoke with a new thought.
