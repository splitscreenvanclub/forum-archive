Its battleship grey, no way pearl white!\n<br> \n<br> Thankfully the place I bought it off, accept it was there mistake ( after some hesitations of course ) and agreed to do another lot. They said they made it exactly how the paint code suggested and couldnt work out why it come out this colour. Although I have kind of lost faith in them now, but hope the new lot is more like what I should have had originally. !!! Anyone else had this problem with a paint shop?\n<br> \n<br> Resto been going to smooth, so was bound to have a hidcup sooner or later!!",
