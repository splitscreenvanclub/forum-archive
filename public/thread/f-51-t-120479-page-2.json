It's an open market and it's global, it has naff all to do with London, UK, EU or anything else, simple as that.\n<br> \n<br> Many years ago in the 80s I bought my first bus for £350, I was shocked a year later when a basket case came up for £750, then it eventually went to £1k per window and I thought the world had gone mad. I literally laughed at a £38k price tag on a very similar RHD 23 Window with a Devon interior at Vanfest around 2005/6.\n<br> \n<br> If money is what you are concerned about, then look around for other 56 23 window RHDs. \n<br> \n<br> This is a stunning bus and a bargain in today's current market\n<br> \n<br> Good luck with the sale!",
