The idea was that apart from the rear linkage on the box itself, we wanted standard parts throughout rather than having custom cables, custom lever and assembly etc. One because the cost is crazy, the cables alone would have been the best part of £350 and the lever quotes were around the £400 mark!! The Boxster cables and front mech can be picked up really easily so if anything needs replacing its off the shelf bits. The brass bits and stainless all thread will never break so it should be a fairly easy to maintain system. Plus the whole thing cost about £100 with materials \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
