Extra adults are £40.00 and kids are £26.00.\n<br>\n<br>The Campsite is available for four nights from Thursday 27 May although the event officially starts on Friday 28 May. \n<br>\n<br>For those who have been before, unfortunately the campsite at Cronk Aashen won’t be ready in time for us this year because of drainage work and reseeding to the fields over the winter, but we have found another great location just up the road in the heart of Kirk Michael village, with lovely views over the mountains, close to the beach, shops and not least, the pub!!!\n<br>\n<br>The best option would be to travel to the Island from Belfast, Liverpool or Heysham on Thursday 27th, or from Liverpool/Heysham on Friday 28th. Return dates start from Sunday 30th to all three ports, but please phone the Steam Packet Holidays Team for all the details. You are welcome to extend your stay, add passengers, dogs etc to your booking. If you want to stay a little longer you will just need to arrange your own accommodation.\n<br>\n<br>To book and for further info on travel etc. call the Steampacket Holidays team on \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">+448457585833</span>\n<br>\n<br>If you would like to contact someone in the club please email \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">secretary@iomvdubclub.com</span>\n<br>\n<br>Some other useful links:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.cyw-iom.co.uk/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.cyw-iom.co.uk/</a> to keep you updated\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.steam-packet.com/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.steam-packet.com/</a> for timetables only\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.visitisleofman.com/\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.visitisleofman.com/</a>for touristy stuff\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/?filter=app_2361831622#/group.php?gid=48257556903\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.facebook.com/?filter=app_2361831622#/group.php?gid=48257556903</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;\">Fancy dress theme </span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Vikings</span></span>",
