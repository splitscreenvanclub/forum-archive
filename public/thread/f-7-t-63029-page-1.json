    "content" : "Good afternoon, \n<br>\n<br>Our 1967 crewcab pickup was stolen this week from our holiday home in Brittany, France.\n<br>\n<br>It has recently undergone a full restoration although was not quite finished. At the time of the theft it needed rear lights and front indicators, as well as the VW badge on the front to complete.\n<br>\n<br>Please let me know if anyone gets offered this anywhere in the world for sale as there is a reward leading to the recovery of the vehicle.At the time of writing the UK and French national police have been informed, as have Interpol.\n<br>\n<br>Itâ€™s a distinctive and unusual vehicle, so should be very recognisable for anyone who is looking for, or has been offered one of these.\n<br>\n<br>I would love to lay my hands on the thieving cowardly ******* who took it but a good kicking would be too good for them, so I will let them deal with the relevant authorities.\n<br>\n<br>I will supply more details via PM as it has some distinctive features that can identify it.\n<br>\n<br>Pics can be found here : \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/Tim.Harrington73/1967CrewCabPickup?feat=directlink\">http://picasaweb.google.com/Tim.Harring ... directlink</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for all your help\n<br>\n<br>Cheers",
