    "content" : "Ok after all the aggro i had getting the drum back on, everything is all reassembled . All seemed fine, but went for a 10 mile run, and on return the nearside rear wheel is decidedly warmer than the offside. I have tried the adjusters and got them back as far as they will go. Don't think its the handbrake , had that slackened right off, and have checked it for applying and releasing.\n<br>Given that I had a real job getting the shoes to fit, is it likely to be them just bedding in? How hot is too hot? I can hold my hand on the wheel and keep it on . The fronts though are cold by comparison, but I haven't done anything to those. Nearside seems harder to turn by hand than the offside, but I don't seem to have any adjustment left!\n<br>Your thoughts please",
