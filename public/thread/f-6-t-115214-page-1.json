    "content" : "I know I should know this, but I get a mental block every time I come to do this as it always seems counter intuitive ! If the clutch is biting in the middle of the pedal travel how do I adjust it. Which way do I turn the nut on the cable by the box (tighten or slacken) if I want it to bite lower to the floor or higher up. \n<br>In my case the clutch is engaging / dis engaging close to the floor and I want it to bite higher in its travel. It's a new clutch but is not adjusted correctly. I could do trial and error I realise, but it's a faff to do it so would rather grovel under the bus just the once!",

If you carry a spare cable, always a good idea to carry a spare wingnut as well because Sod's law says when the cable breaks (rare I know) you'll never be able to find the end bit with the nut still on it. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
