    "content" : "Very sad sale of this one simply through lack of time. This one was going to be a \"keeper\" as part of a life long collection of a few very fine early Split buses,the type which almost never come up for sale, but times change and I could now use the funds to put into other things.\n<br>\n<br>So brief description... \n<br>\n<br>As many know I only ever offer totally rust free buses and over the 40 plus buses i`ve owned over the last 15 years this ones the nicest by far \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> Condition wise It` s like you`d expect to find a 3 year old car.\n<br>\n<br>1 owner from new!\n<br>Unrestored California \"black plate\" bus \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>Totally original throughout \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>Always garaged from new in Southern California!\n<br>NO RUST ANYWHERE, not a pin prick. NO accident damage anywhere ever. Zero filler. Arrow straight sides.\n<br>Very very rare \"Gardena Gypsy\" camper conversion. Super practical interior in VGC.\n<br>etc etc.\n<br>\n<br>It`s totally un F`uked, un hacked, un messed in every way. Just lovely.\n<br>\n<br>There are NO issues with this bus.\n<br>\n<br>I`ve restored the bumpers and a few other items since these pics were taken. I took apart the pop outs and front door windows to replace the perished rubbers. All pop out/front door frame metalwork is in mint condition. These need reassembly with the new rubbers (included in sale) and then the bus just needs to be greased up/serviced mot`d etc etc.\n<br>\n<br>All the paperwork is in order. Runs/Drives sweet as a nut.\n<br>\n<br>I simply just don`t have the time do get this done at the mo and it`s been in dry storage for over two years now and so really feel it just needs to start being enjoyed.\n<br>\n<br>I am offering this up for sale at £16500 \"as is\" or \"18995\" fully done. This price difference does not reflect the work needed (which is some very basic reassembly of the windows with new rubbers, basic service/ tune up etc etc) but simply reflects the lack of time i have available to do it and would rather give someone a really good deal and let them do the final finishing off etc.\n<br>\n<br>At £16500 there is not a bus for sale that`ll match this almost unique opportunity to purchase a time warp early bus of tha I am confident. NO BS - Check feedback on previous for sale threads etc - speaks for itself. cheers.\n<br>\n<br>NO offers. Price is firm. thanks.\n<br>\n<br>All enquies please call, i don`t have time to answer loads of PM`s etc.\n<br>\n<br>07789 168869\n<br>\n<br>cheers \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>These are the only pics i have, taken a few year back in California. The bus is in exactly the same condition now (as has not driven a mile since) but at the mo bus it`s located right at the back of my dry storage lock up, and it`s difficult to get more pics whilst it`s in its current location.\n<br>\n<br>enjoy :\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j195/Steelrhino/grey1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j195/Steelrhino/grey3.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i80.photobucket.com/albums/j195/Steelrhino/grey4.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",

Yep, at £16.5K it`s not a cheap bus by any means, but it is absolutely undoubtably the nicest bus you`ll get for that money. Whether you by a bus outright or by a project and add resto costs a better deal will not be had on this side of the pond or the other, of that I am confident.\n<br>\n<br>I would normally not consider selling this under £18995, but lack of time to do the fine finishing details etc has mad eme decide to give someone a really sweet deal on this bus.\n<br>\n<br>I`ve seen over 1000 buses for sale in the last 15 years around the globe, of them i`ve bought only the very very cleanest examples, and over that period of time two exapmles stood out in a league of their own - this bus and the Mango microbus, so I kept them for myself as part of a \"dream split bus collection\"...\n<br>\n<br>As times moved on and other bigger commitments (house...lol) have taken over, a \"collection\" of split buses simply isn`t viable and I`m grateful now just to be able to hold onto one. The funny thing is is that the one I`m holding onto isn`t anywhere as near as nice condition wise as the two that I`m selling but it`s the only one that I`ve used extensively and so has all the great memories associated with it which would be irreplaceable.\n<br>\n<br>I hope this simlply amazingly well preserved \"unique\" camper can find a really great home \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
