Are you really out there..\n<br>Started my build..\n<br>Promise I will add pictures..\n<br>Initial TM10 spec 1776cc picture he sent as an example of a Bus unit.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1776cc%20engine/DSC02718_zpsb3d2831b.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1776cc%20engine/DSC02718_zpsb3d2831b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
