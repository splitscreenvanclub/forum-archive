I especially like the Bluetooth bit on it too.\n<br> Only thing missing IMHO is a DAB element but you can get AUX input DAB units separately from a range of suppliers.\n<br> Anyway, looks good, sounds good. What's not to like?\n<br> Wasn't cheap though but certainly looks retro enough (pun intended)\n<br> Hope that helps ya\n<br> DD",
