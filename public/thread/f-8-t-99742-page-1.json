Thought it was about time i started a thread on here, after i bought my first bus in august this year.\n<br>\n<br>I recognise a few names from over on the SBS forum so some of you may have seen my build thread already, if not, here it is……….\n<br>\n<br>So a few months ago, i decided i needed a replacement for my lowlight i sold 2 years ago (actually only sold it to pay towards the renovation of my house)\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/P7190142.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>I also dabble with watercooled VW's too, mk1's and a couple of mk2's, so my mk2 golf has kept me occupied until now.\n<br>\n<br>I was pretty specific with what i wanted, either a panel or 11 window, preferably dove blue or mango, small rear hatch, lights etc, bonus if i could find a pressed bumper van but not fussed if not.\n<br>\n<br>After a few months of searching the samba i found pretty solid looking 11 window mango (sort of) Its been painted at some point and has started to be stripped back to OG, but all the door shuts, engine bay, interior, dash is all still mango. So after a few emails a deal was done and it was on its way to the port……. this was back in september.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, heres a few of the pics that helped me decide to buy it...….\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3195_zps141b22bc.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3196_zpsd9d6d0ef.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3197_zps0c9cdddb.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3190_zpsdee87483.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3165_zps0ea8d1d1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3224_zps904924af.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3205_zpsb5923899.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3217_zpsec0ce30b.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3234_zpsb955e765.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3228_zpsa7709fd7.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3181_zpse98bd960.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3177_zpsdfaf4d5f.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m72/slammedveedub/IMG_3186_zps5b077af3.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>And some bits I picked up from busfest.....\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1175225_10153183560160109_1502791699_n.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Plans are\n<br>Steering box Raise\n<br>4.5\" Narrowed beam\n<br>Dropped spindles\n<br>Tubbed arches\n<br>Strip the paint back (hopefully) to OG Mango \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>1500 type3 gearbox and SA set up\n<br>Decent stereo as i love my tunes.....
