Sometimes it records about the right revs, sometimes zero, sometimes no where near the right reading.\n<br> \n<br> I have a Lucas coil, Accuspark electronic ignition, new plugs and leads, new dizzy cap and a SVDA dizzy.\n<br> \n<br> I've read that resistance on tachos can be an issue but thought I'd plug into the wisdom of the forum first.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Jonny",
