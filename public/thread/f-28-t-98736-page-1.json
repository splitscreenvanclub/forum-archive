Just want to optimize grip so wondered what you guys and gals were all running",

    "content" : "Cheers mate I'm running a irs rear so with lowest amount of hassle looks like a 6 will be me then. Image wheels are actually making me a 3 piece split wheel so hoping I can push the limits a little. Biggest problem would be the spring plate and bodywork of arch. On measuring it did look possible to run a 7 tho?",

    "content" : "I'm currently playing with some big rims, on a SA converted bus.\n<br>\n<br>11\" rims wouldn't go inside the arch to spring plate gap, so if you really wanted that width, then a narrowed rear torsion housing would be needed, but then on a SA bus there's limited commercially available axle lengths with the correct spline lengths for big brakes.\n<br>\n<br>First set of 9\" fitted in the arch, but sat on the spring plate, so that would need a small spacer, though that would have put the tyre very close to the bodywork.\n<br>\n<br>Then got a set of modified 11\" rims, that are narrowed down to 9\" but have a better offset than the stock 9\". Result is the rim sits bang in the middle of the arch / spring plate gap. No tubbing required. So there will be a 235/35x19\" tyre which is way more than is needed really.\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=1861&amp;sid=667e74a99e11d96fc4d6d4c4385f56a5&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=1861&amp;t=1&amp;sid=667e74a99e11d96fc4d6d4c4385f56a5\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"tyre.jpg\" title=\"tyre.jpg (49.37 KiB) Viewed 1689 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>\n<br>Then at the front, its going to need a narrowed beam, to get the tyre inside the arch.\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=1862&amp;sid=667e74a99e11d96fc4d6d4c4385f56a5&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=1862&amp;t=1&amp;sid=667e74a99e11d96fc4d6d4c4385f56a5\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"rim.jpg\" title=\"rim.jpg (65.02 KiB) Viewed 1689 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
