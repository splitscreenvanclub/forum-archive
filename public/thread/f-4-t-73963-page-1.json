    "content" : "Ive just made a bench seat for my bus so the seats that were in my bus are no longer needed. They were put in long before i bought my bus,originally were from a honda crx. I had the crx logos covered with a better slogan \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> They are both in really good condition,comfy on long journeys,come with the runners which bolted straight through the cab floor. Ideal if you wanna customise your bus etc\n<br>looking for Â£100 for the pair,collection preferred or you arrange courier,maybe be able to take to a show.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/SAM_0205.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/SAM_0203.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v216/kevsplitty/SAM_0204.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
