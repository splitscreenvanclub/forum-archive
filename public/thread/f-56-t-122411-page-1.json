    "content" : "I know there's another thread somewhere on here relating to Chassis numbers on Brazilian buses, however I've lost it and don't quite remember seeing the info I need!\n<br> \n<br> I have a 1961 11 window Brazilian Kombi that I've just imported, and am now going through the delightful process of getting it registered. I have a question relating to the chassis number location. Mine has it's 5 digit number stamped in the area to the right of the engine, which in itself is fine, however there doesn't appear to be any other vin plate or number anywhere else on the vehicle (apart from the engine number).\n<br> \n<br> As this is a very early Brazilian bus, I'm aware that records kept back then (and subsequently) were not nearly as good as the Germans, however could this be correct that I only have the number stamped in the engine bay or should there be a vin plate somewhere else too?? Any insight from those more experienced with Brazilian Kombi history most welcome!",
