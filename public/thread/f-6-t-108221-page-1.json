    "content" : "Trying to correct a cock up either by restoration company or the previous owner. The master cylinder is fowling on the anti roll bar and was hoping someone could list my available options;\n<br> \n<br> I have a 67 bus, not sure if this is the original dual circuit MC or a later bay version. I read on Creative Engineering in their 'shocks' section that once lowered anti roll bar is not necessary unless you are driving to the 'extremes' whatever that may be, I have 1600 twin port so I assume I would fall out with that category.\n<br> \n<br> Attached a couple of pictures.\n<br> \n<br> I have adjustable front beam and was going to raise it a few notches as there is some occasional rubbing when going over pot holes etc but not sure if that would resolve this.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance\n<br> Chris",

    "content" : "The roll bar will come up with no weight on the wheels.\n<br> During driving it will be miles away as in the other photos. But check with the bus on the ground using a torch to see etc.\n<br> \n<br> Personally a roll bar I think is good for all ride heights. if the bus is so low and not tubbed that the wheels are within a cm or 2 of the arches then yes a roll bar is largely pointless as any roll will result in the wheel just rubbing on the arches. But properly set up with the right shocks etc, then i think a roll bar is good even in the heavily dropped buses.\n<br> \n<br> Depending on the choice of beam adjusters dropping a bus normally involves rotating both sets of leaves, so no stiffness is added/lost. if its a single adjuster type then rotating only one set of leaves will mean the other set is wound up and therefore stiffer (same can be achieved but rotating each different amounts). But it does not act as an anti-roll bar, it only stiffens it all up.",
