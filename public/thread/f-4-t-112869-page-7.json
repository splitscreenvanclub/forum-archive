Wound the nut up until it was around level with the top of where the spacer plate would be then wound it in a couple of threads to allow for the angle and to ensure it didn't bottom out. Removed and fitted it to the shifter. \n<br>Spacer goes in the recess on the floor (early bay, cannot remember if my Split had the same recess, but I assume so), shifter on top of that. You can still see the ball in the coupler from above, so if the depths doesn't look quite right now is the time to adjust up or down. Easy peasy really, not like you have a slot to adjust on the shifter.",
