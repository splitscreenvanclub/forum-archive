I haven't pumped any grease into the spindles yet, but thing they have been used for about 4000 miles since being flipped, so wouldn't have thought they were dry?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",

I put the bolts back in as they came out - nut on the top, but guess I should have turned them round so the bolt goes in from the top with the nut on the botom, doh!\n<br>\n<br>reckon they should be ok with standard bolts, but otherwise will have to find some shallow headed bolts.\n<br>\n<br>thanks again buddy !",
