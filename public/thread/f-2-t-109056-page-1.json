Want something like that sounds good, looks cool and will run from an android phone. I have seen a cool looking skull shaped one by Jarre but don't know if it will work. Think it would look neat on the dash next to my tacho. Thought and pictures please.",

Is it loud enough as I don't thing the Bose mini one is quite loud enough on the motorway with road noise, wind noise etc. also can you connect things via a 3.5mm jack/aux lead as well (I have a rather old iPod classic \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> )\n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
