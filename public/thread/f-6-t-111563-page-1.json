I currently have a black steering wheel but much prefer the White. \n<br> \n<br> I have a 1965 Kombi who was originally velvet green but I want to go 2 tone with the white colour on top and an undecided colour for below the swage line. \n<br> \n<br> Any help would be appreciated. \n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> \n<br> Duncan",
