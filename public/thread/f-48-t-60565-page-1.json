It shows some of the different options available and the different layouts possible by folding the bench seats in different ways. If anyone wants a copy I can run some off and bring them along to Slough. Only payment required will be a pound to be given to the first collector you see for the Poppy Appeal. If you wat one text me on 07966 106336 and I will contact you once I'm at Slough.\n<br>Cheers, Lee",

We have owned it for 10 years and the one thing that has always caused confusion is the over cab bed. The brackets are already there, two in the front, one behind the curtain above the table in the back and what appears to be a locating plate on the floor in front of the cooker housing it appears to make a double bed. We are looking for any details of how the originals looked and are hoping that the sales brochure may have some information, perhaps as an optional extra. We seem to be unable to locate anybody who has this bed and so are looking to recreate one for our son. Ours is not a pop top so there is only the double bed which is not really big enough for two adults and a 5 year old!!\n<br>\n<br>We would really appreciate a copy of your brochure even if it does not contain details of the bed we are sure it will make interesting reading.",
