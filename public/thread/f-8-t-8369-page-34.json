    "content" : "Work starts, several weeks (months!) later, on the panelling ... \n<br>\n<br>This was my dpeartment, so the cock ups starting coming in thick and fast on this one. I ran out of t&amp;g twice. Yes, twice ... \n<br>\n<br>And despite measuring twice, and cutting once, I managed to get the t&amp;g half a plank out on the second door, so they did not line up. It bugged me a little, as I had tried so hard to get this right, but I'll be honest, I struggled to visualise the doors together and in place. (Had I room to lay both doors down together in situ it would have helped me) \n<br>I ended up being 180 out, or something ... There was a strong argument for going back and lifting all the nailed in planks on one of the doors, and recutting them properly. In the end I decided I could live with it. I am NOT a perfect person, and this is me accepting that. It was hard enough getting this far!\n<br>\n<br>Then I had to work out how to do the window frames. I winged it here. They turned out pretty good actually, I'm hoping when Susie gets around to doing the leaded lights using recycled 1930's glass it'll work out how I planned ...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/wGcND4\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/543/20145666005_596524a65b_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Spot the schoolboy error\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/vKk51a\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/438/19524676193_79d97da79a_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Working out what size to make the window and where to position it in the door ...\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/wDT8XL\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/397/20119390886_5724085423_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Proped up in place. yep, those windows are exactly how I'd hoped they'd look!\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/wFusvs\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/290/20137598692_fd3b4ec2ae_c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
