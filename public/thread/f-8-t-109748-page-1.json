    "content" : "Something else I've been tinkering with. These are rails for a slide-out container to go in the treasure chest.\n<br>\n<br>The treasure chest is great for storage, but stuff slides around and anything weighty will just knock dents in to the side panels Also, anything at the back is hard to get to, so a few guys in the states have rigged pull-out containers. All the ones that I've seen rest on the treasure chest floor, but I don't want to trap moisture that might encourage rot to set in, so I'm suspending mine with a decent air gap all round and underneath.\n<br>\n<br>Haven't made the container yet, but I bolted up some steel channel the other day. Again, I'm trying to avoid doing anything that can't be simply reversed without damage, so the channel is suspended from the 'spine' beams that support the load bed using threaded bar and plates from a trailer u-bolt. The plan is to fit some spring loaded door bolts to the box that will engage with holes in the channel to stop it sliding out too far and to lock it in place when it's stowed, so it doesn't slide back and forth and smash in to the bodywork.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_0998_zpszn2nehax.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1001_zpstvuaill4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The black stuff is more of that damned spray on bedliner. I've been experimenting with ways to get it off, and I've found that a hot air paint stripper gun works well. It softens the liner before it attacks the paint, so the liner scrapes off. I'm going to have a go on the beams and the thick cargo floor, but I may have to leave it on the larger, thinner body panels, for fear of warping them.",
