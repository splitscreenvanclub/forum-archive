    "content" : "Status VW were broken into last week and have had plenty of things stolen including alot of Barclays personal NOS bug bits ive just received this email from him and would like to share it.\n<br>\n<br>Hi all, in response to the stuff on the forums about our break-in, we'd like to issue some kind of statement and as I'm not registered on the forums, would be grateful if you could post on our behalf.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br> \n<br>Dear VW Friends,\n<br> \n<br>Following our break-in last week, we wanted to write a note to everyone who has been helping and supporting us so much over the last few days, so thought a reply to the forum posts would be the quickest and easiest way to reach so many people.\n<br> \n<br>The scene that greeted us a week ago was one of utter devastation. When realisation quickly came and we worked out we had been robbed, the emotions were understandably running high. Our New Beetle Cabriolet was the large obvious item that was taken and it was clear that stock had also been taken. After the Police and Forensics had been in, we started the clear-up and have been working on the stock lists to ascertain exactly what items have gone. Upto now, we have accounted for over £60,000 worth of stock and my collection of rare NOS vintage parts worth over £10,000 has also gone.\n<br> \n<br>As news spread quickly over the internet and forums, we have been inundated with emails and calls from people offering their help and support to us in any way they can and we have really been touched by the generosity of the VW scene and the speed in which so many people have helped us. Its you, the VW scene that make this industry what it is and we really wanted to say a huge 'THANK YOU' to everyone who has offered their help and support and those of you who are avidly watching Ebay and the Samba for our things to appear. \n<br> \n<br>Our suppliers are also being very helpful in getting orders to us from Germany within 2 days and from America within 3 days. We are still open for business, but if you have orders that you need quickly, please order as much in advance as possible so we can replenish stock of anything that we are now missing. \n<br> \n<br>On a positive note, we are also now starting the construction of our new showroom and museum and hope to have this opened early in the New Year. We really look foward to welcoming you to our showroom but you can still call to collect items even now before the showroom is opened - check out our website for our address details in Warwickshire.\n<br> \n<br>We would be really grateful if you could copy this post onto other forums that you may be members of on our behalf. Thank you once again and we look forward to seeing many of you at the shows in 2010 or here in our showroom.\n<br> \n<br>Best wishes,\n<br> \n<br>Barclay &amp; Julie Stainton\n<br>STATUS VW PARTS",
