So I have stuck with the known and trusted format of 3.5mm jack plug/socket, which apple still use on all their docks even for the iPhone 6 (although its at the back).It also does give the phone incredible stability in the dock.\n<br>\n<br>thanks for sending the comment through I'm always open to new ideas and pointers as it easy to be so close to something you design that you can miss the obvious!\n<br>\n<br>Mark",
