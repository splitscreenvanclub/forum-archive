    "content" : "Next year will mark the 25th Anniversary of the Split Screen Van Club and there will be many ways in which this will be celebrated. \n<br>What we're really missing on the site is a history of the club, so to try and fill this gap I've had an idea.... \n<br> \n<br>How about a photographic history? \n<br> \n<br>It would be great to have some photos (with a little bit of text) from each of the years covering such things as: \n<br>\n<ul>\n Club line ups at shows\n <br>Club camping weekends\n <br>Seedlings activities\n <br>Key milestones\n <br>Vans of the year\n <br>Founder members (and founder members buses)\n <br>Anything relevant to the history of the club\n</ul> \n<br> \n<br>Each year will have it's own thread, I've made a sample here for 2005...... \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=259842\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=259842</a> \n<br> \n<br>Some of the early years may be difficult as digital images are a recent thing so we'll have to rely on scanned photos. \n<br> \n<br>If you can post your name, some description, a not too large image (800x600), ideally with a link to a full size picture that would be great. (see the link above for a very poor example) \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>Once (if) we get enough photos I'll start pulling them together into a site. \n<br> \n<br>As a little project/idea it may not work but I think it will be cool if it does. If we get a really good response it may even be possible to pull them together into a book. \n<br> \n<br>Feel free to share any ideas you have on this.",
