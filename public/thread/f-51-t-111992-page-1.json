    "content" : "Hi Ron,\n<br>\n<br>the 15w is very original. OG Paint. All original seats and door panels. Mohair Roof. It will new sills on both sides and maybe a small part of a new front floor (there some small holes in the front floor). I have most of the metal. It will go with the bus. You can do the repairs, blend the paint and you have a really nice 15w deluxe bus.\n<br>\n<br>For his age the bus is in very good conditions. I brought the bus from a good friend in the U.S. He lives in CA and later in NV. He had the bus for over 20 year. The engine is runing strong and the bus shifts well. I don't know why the bus has 5 keys \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>Are you interested?\n<br>\n<br>cheers",
