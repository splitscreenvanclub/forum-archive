There's another thread somewhere on here where all the parts of the CE kit were identified.\n<br> The discussion was around Dave Palmer (CE) talking 'bout patenting his design, and someone identified all of the parts used ie T25 bevel box and Bedford Rascal rack and therefor CE would not be able to patent which might be why DP to date claims his kit as the 'intellectual' propety of CE.\n<br> Not really a proper rack and pinion conversion in my humble opinion as it still uses lots of original bits, and only replaces the steering box and drag link, everything else remains.\n<br> Plenty of people have used them tho' and seem to like them.\n<br> I also don't like the fact that you have to relocate the horn push as it has a solid column and and you can't therefor feed the horn push wire up the middle like stock.

I'm happy with the kit on my van and don't feel i need power steering, If i wanted a really modern driving van then I'd buy a new T5 \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
