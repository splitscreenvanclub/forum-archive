Besides, my left hand didn't work properly after a couple of hours going at the wheelarch and floor! I've got to get the underside of the cab looking as new and clean as the cargo floor!\n<br> \n<br> Oh, and I've got a new solid roof to weld on at some point. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
