I would be after something Which was as close to fit and set up and forget if there is such a thing, the engine currently has a old CB efi with dials in the cab which are glued in place any recommendations greatly revived.",

    "content" : "I recommend you fine your nearest rolling road that you trust, and ask them. \n<br> \n<br> Mappers can be funny about what systems they will touch, and you need one they'll help you with. \n<br> \n<br> At the end of the day, most ECU's will do the job, but it's better you don't have to travel 100's miles to get it on the rollers.\n<br> \n<br> I've used DTA / OMEX / CB numerous times. I own DTA and OMEX ECU's. Jen's has DTA.\n<br> \n<br> The newer CB are better at self learning than the old system. \n<br> \n<br> Most systems run in closed loop if you set them up that way, but need setting up first",
