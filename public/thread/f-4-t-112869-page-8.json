Took ablut 5 miles to get used you it then was smooooooth as you like \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>It does feel a. It stiff (ooeerr missus) but seems to be loosening up the more I'm driving it. There is no play in the gearstick whatsoever and it requires minimal movement to change gear. It feels almost like the gearshift was on my old MGB-GT which has a gearstick that was about 2\" long. Reverse is easy to find and I've not missed a gear since it was fitted but I have been taking it easy whilst I get used to it. \n<br>Only thing is that it doesn't come with a rubber boot so you get a bit of a draught coming up and it looks a bit odd seeing the road as you're driving along \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> I'm in the process of sourcing a rubber boot to fit but no luck as of yet. Is it worth the money? Oh yes, most definitely \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> along with my Red9'front end it's probably one of my favorite things I've bought for the bus.\n<br>Pics will be on my build thread shortly \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee",
