    "content" : "Had a post in the Devon interiors forum but this has turned into a project so will be adding the details here.\n<br>\n<br>I have owned my RHD split for 5 years, it was a Devon in a previous life but when I bought it there was a home made Devon-ish interior in it which has served me well. The original Devon interior was rotten and thrown out before I got my hands on her. The bus has been great and we have enjoyed all the trips we have been on. However since the birth of my son on trips in camping mode we found we were looking for a bit more space and storage.\n<br>\n<br>So after lurking around here , reading, watching , visiting the shows a wish list started in my head and plans were scribbled down.\n<br>\n<br>Here is my bus with interior before:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/IMG_0445mollyandgreenhousever2800x600.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/camperinterior.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/rearhatch.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>It was decided to begin the interior resto and the inside was stripped out. Anyway I always wanted to see the state of the floor.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/floor.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Once the floor was cleaned up the next step was to add some roof space so a trip on the ferry from Jersey was done and it was booked in with Dormobile.\n<br>\n<br>Tin top :\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2309Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2309Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Hole in top : \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2312Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2312Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I know some people will think its sacrilegious cutting a perfectly good tin top. I was a long thought out decision. My son grows bigger everyday, 3 of us sleeping inside on the bed was no fun. We plan to camp in this bus for at least 10 years and I can now put on my jeans in the morning without falling out the cargo doors.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2315Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2315Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2339Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2339Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2340Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2340Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2341Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2341Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2332Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2332Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So got to say the guys at Dormobile were excellent, good to deal with, pleased with their work and how it turned out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2328Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2328Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Once back home, floor went down. 9mm marine ply.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Devon%20Stuff/2014-11-30%2013.59.19.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/2014-11-30%2013.59.19.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Devon%20Stuff/IMG_3938.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/IMG_3938.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Devon%20Stuff/1b0429a5-0016-4d01-8b09-6cc4d8f03cdf.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/1b0429a5-0016-4d01-8b09-6cc4d8f03cdf.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and tiles\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Devon%20Stuff/2014-11-30%2015.56.17.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Devon%20Stuff/2014-11-30%2015.56.17.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",

So still a problem. Dormobile don't have anything better anymore and they have tried to make pieces or have pieces made that don't work well. Planning to finish that bit off in a nice bit of oak. I did tell them if they had something better they would sell them.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s828.photobucket.com/user/jaysk/media/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2341Copy.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i828.photobucket.com/albums/zz201/jaysk/Dormobile%20Fitting/IMG_2341Copy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
