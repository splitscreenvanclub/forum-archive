The trans was not happy going in to 1st or 2nd, so out it came again!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/D5A5FC98-C181-4BDA-AA3E-EDBB0446068E-2852-0000043715D45E74.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>As luck would have it I was moving a bus to a paint shop for a good friend of mine last Saturday, and as he has gone straight axle, his big nut trans was spare! Thanks for being a lifesaver Al! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> So, more rib grinding and trans prepping and axle gaiter fitting and nosecone swapping later, I popped this one in! Lucky for me one side had new parts throughout, so less bits to buy! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/902F5DCC-A9E8-458D-816D-120A0A873479-2852-000004370A622EA8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>As the bus was 6V, the bell housing needed to be ground out to take the 12V flywheel as well, so in with the flap disc yet again, and finally we have an engine in the massive hole at the back!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_compress.gif\" alt=\":compress:\" title=\"compress\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/74FF611C-EC38-45F5-9BB3-E8D115A55B48-2852-00000437120E508F.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>(Yes, I know its not a 30hp)\n<br>\n<br>So, shake the can and dunked the axle tubes in black, bolted up the torsion bar end caps, tightened everything holding the trans in, including that adaptor at the front - I discovered that its easier to put the trans in if the adaptor is already fitted to the bus, just mate the nosecone up to it and do the 2 bolts, much easier!! \n<br>\n<br>So now I have an engine that turns without grinding, but I still need a set of brakes for the offside drum. I'm going to rip the old trans apart and see if I can use the handbrake bars from it later, they will probably be different lengths but as long as I use both of them I will be fine.....",

    "content" : "So, we have some more progress! My friend has been very busy with the weaving of the wires, and the loom is almost ready to be sent off to be wrapped! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> The only problem is that the only company in the UK that do the cloth weave over the loom have a 4 week lead time.. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> Looking good so far though!! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/EA8DACEF-1B5B-4E78-A62F-33171AD1CE5A-8758-00000CB540E1E04C.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Also dug out the spare wheel tray, really nice paint on this!! \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/B6A78EBB-976D-43D7-9C7C-F6C3D08457DC-8758-00000CB546C56FE5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So, started bolting front end bits up and hit a problem. During its front end battering in the past, the steering box shaft had gotten bent, which Mr H did a great job of sorting, however I did not realise that the column was also bent at the bottom to compensate for the bent steering box! Check out the pics:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/8218AE32-5E60-4FD5-9EA9-4637F9AAE2E3-8758-00000CB513CCF8D8.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i195/streetwagens/1950/A6B77405-F7B3-48B9-AD05-6A484C965BB4-8758-00000CB50DB27330.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I'm going to have a go at it tonight with a bit of heat and BIG HAMMERS, but as I'm up in Bristol I don't have a big bench with a big vice to make the job easier! Might have to park the T5 on the column so I can hold it down properly to work on it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Also found that all the front 22mm wheel cylinders I have are seized solid, and after some maths decided that the 22mm x 22.2mm rears on the big nut trans would not make for a happy braking system, so I have to fork out on a set of cylinders to fit my 59 brakes, and also buy a bigger master cylinder to throw the anchors down. Expensive times as I have been let down by one supplier already, I could do without spending out on parts twice at the moment! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>I also need some tinware for the engine, as it is missing all but the essentials! No flaps, no thermostat, no bottom tin, and as it came out of an early bay, I also need a front piece for doghouse bug and a rear piece too!",
