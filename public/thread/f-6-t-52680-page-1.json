    "content" : "Hello,\n<br>\n<br>I am looking to rebuild the 5 year non starter 1.3 I have in my 64 bug now to as best a performing 1.6 twin port as I can. I am pretty early on in my research of looking for parts etc and wondered if anyone could recommend any set ups/parts to me. Any recommendations or ideas would be alot of help and much appreciated.\n<br>\n<br>Also, I have been looking into the CSP super competition exhaust. I have rang a couple of people about these, with not a lot of help to be honest. Basically what I want to know is would it actually be worth putting one of these on my bug, taking into account the price and what effect/performance boost it would give on my 1.6. I understand it gives you good clearance when lowering the car but I presume it is for engines that are larger than 1.6? Would it be worth doing?\n<br>\n<br>Like I said, any advice, recommendations or info would be fantastic,\n<br>\n<br>John",
