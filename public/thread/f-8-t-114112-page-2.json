Jasper asked for recommendations for people to help, so apart from loving his bus, if i could help him in anyway, if he didn't live 300 miles away, then I'm happy to help &amp; of course, even if we are too far away, advise costs nothing, so happy like you, to help that way to. We're based in North Devon, we currently have a '59 vert from the midlands, a '66 11 window from Reading, so sensible distance isn't to much of a problem either \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
