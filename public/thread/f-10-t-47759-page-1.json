The cruise will start at 2pm so please try arrive on time.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/IMG_0116.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>This is the route the cruise will take\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/BristolChristmascruise2008\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://tinyurl.com/BristolChristmascruise2008</a>\n<br>\n<br>Much more detailed instructions for the route can be found here:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://krazydubclub.co.uk/crimbocruise/Cruiseroute2008.pdf\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://krazydubclub.co.uk/crimbocruise/Cruiseroute2008.pdf</a> - if possible PLEASE PRINT THESE DETAILS SO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING. The aim is to also have small signs by the roadside at all the major junctions, marked with a VW logo or similar.\n<br>\n<br>The route has been modified since last year due to a few traffic flow issues.\n<br>\n<br>The cruise will end up at the Golden Heart pub, Winterbourne. This is just off the Bristol ring road, with easy access to the M4 and M5.\n<br>Some hot food will be availiable at the pub - details will be posted nearer the time. \n<br>\n<br>A suggested minimum of £1 per person contribution is asked for - the proceeds will be split between Brads Cancer Foundation (\n<a href=\"http://www.brads.org.uk/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.brads.org.uk/</a>) and Props (Providing Opportunities and Support for those with special needs) (\n<a href=\"http://www.props4ward.org/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.props4ward.org/</a>). This will be collected from the same table as the hot drinks at the start of the cruise. A limited number of special edition 'Bristol Christmas Cruise' stickers will be availiable for the first people to donate \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Hot food will also be available at the downs before the cruise from Steve of Cookin' Camper (\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://cookincamper.co.uk/index.htm\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\">http://cookincamper.co.uk/index.htm</a>\n<!-- m -->) as well as free hot drinks provided by Danbury motorcaravans (Again, donations for charity would be appreciated)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Last year lots of cars were decorated for the event with lights, tinsel etc which was brilliant and really made people stop and stare even more - So this year, the more tinsel, fairy lights and other Christmassy tat the better! \n<br>\n<br>There will be chocolate PRIZES! For the best decorated vehicle and the furthest travelled!\n<br>\n<br>All old VWs are welcome - that includes T25s, new beetles, mk1/2 golfs etc. I'm not gonna say someone can't come!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>If you have any problems or questions before the event, then email \n<a href=\"mailto:bristolchristmascruise@googlemail.com\">bristolchristmascruise@googlemail.com</a>. If you would like to email me on the above address, I can email you a reminder or any up-to-date information regarding the event. \n<br>\n<br>If you have any problems (break-downs etc) on the day or during the cruise, you can ring me on O7528 572763. \n<br>Please also feel free to bring walkie talkies on the cruise – we used them last year with some success.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Finally, if you are arriving from the North of Bristol on the M5, or on the M4, this map should help you arrive at the cruise start point.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ChristmascruiseM4\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://tinyurl.com/ChristmascruiseM4</a>\n<br>\n<br>And here are some more detailed instructions with photos.\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://krazydubclub.co.uk/crimbocruise/FromM4.pdf\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://krazydubclub.co.uk/crimbocruise/FromM4.pdf</a>\n<br>\n<br>If you arriving from Anywhere else, use this link\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ChristmascruiseM4\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\">http://tinyurl.com/ChristmascruiseM4</a>\n<br>and then change the start point 'A' on the LHS to your postcode/start point. Google maps should then provide you with a route to the cruise start point on the Bristol Downs/overlooking the suspension bridge. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/DSCN1628.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/DSC_1450.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/DSC_1493.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/DSC_1473.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/IMG_0050.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/IMG_0067-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Danny Lord, who won the prize last year for 'furthest travelled' - travelling over 400 miles round trip to attend.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/DSC_1461.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>And the winner of the best decorated car last year...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y11/tofufi/Bristol%20Christmas%20Cruise%202007/IMG_0198.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Huge thanks to all those who have helped with the organising - Shamrockez, Dagg's, The CCR Beaver, Rob75, Kank, Flying Split (for hosting the files on the Krazy Dub Club website).
