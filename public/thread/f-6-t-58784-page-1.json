Working on all the hand built cars for around 40 years he certainly knew his metal!!!!\n<br>\n<br> After an hour of unchargeable work I still couldn't convince hime to leave his current job but we may have come to a cool agreement! This being he'd be happy to come and tutor a group of us for a one off days in my workshop. \n<br>\n<br> So as a starting point he's what i'm thinking....Correct me if i'm off the mark...\n<br>\n<br>Most people would want to do this on a saturday?\n<br>5-6 people tops in a group?\n<br>£40-£60 per person (he wont do it for free and will have to hire some equipment)\n<br>Location - Milton Keynes area\n<br>\n<br>If your interested either reply or pm me, this is a suck it and see idea so that we can all do more cost effective repairs etc.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers Al",

As well as dollies galore etc. This guy makes aston parts from scratch so he can roll a wing, form a bonnet, whatever, and remember that astons all had to be metal finished usually only having a filler primer coat before the serious paint!\n<br>\n<br> We'll get 8 hrs of tuition on old metal, new metal, removing dints, bumps and forming new panels, he'll probably divide the day into 4 specialist areas!\n<br>\n<br> My reason for doing this is to bring proper craftsmanship back to our vehicles, most uk bodyshops dont use the time served traditions now and literally either load the car with filler and leave an area like the surface of the moon behind it or gash a new panel!! As mentioned i'm self taught - my experience is racing engines, gearboxes and hydraulics (design, test and build) but i hate to see vehicles with poor bodywork so I took on a unit to finish my four splitties, a KG and a T25 16 inch! I'm half way through this collection and i'm happy with my work but I know there's more to learn. Its also my turn to put something back after 20 years in the vw scene.\n<br>\n<br> A second spin off to this if all was successful would be a lead loading course if anyone would fancy it. Please remember these guys that worked on these vehicles are in there 50-60's and have done this all their lives.\n<br>\n<br> I will provide work benches and also stud welders and tecna spot welders so we can also use these on blind panels. My unit is heated, finished out with toilets, basins etc so your not coming to the bronx. As mentioned its a suck it and see idea! Thats why the price is as is and not £100+",
