President will no doubt give a full and correct answer but AFAIK...the drive away idea was that on the best solution, there is an .....umbilical piece which is attached to the van awning rail and this then zips to the awning...\n  <br> \n  <br> So \n  <br> Method 1) You put the awning up with the vertical side pointing to where you want to put the van and you attach the umbilical bit to the awning rail and then you manoeuvre the van to a pposition where you can zip up..\n  <br> Method 2) You park the van where you want, you put the umbilical bit in the awning rail and then you zip the awning to it and put the poles up and tension the umbilical entry.\n  <br> \n  <br> So when you want to drive away....you unzip...drive forwards and you can then take the umbilical bit off \n  <br> and as it says in the Haynes manual assembly is the reverse of disassembly...\n </div>\n</blockquote> \n<br> That makes sense. I suppose the question is what does this piece look like and where can I get a hold of it....",
