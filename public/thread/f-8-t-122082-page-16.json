    "content" : "For the handbrake cable issue - I'm guessing you've fitted a big-nut (fully synchromesh) transmission? If so, your options are\n<br> \n<br> 1/. Extend the stock cables (shortest ones) with a length of threaded bar the same thread as the ends of the handbrake cable and a pair of matching threaded bar connecting nuts (Screwfix sell both), plus a couple of ordinary nuts to use as lock-nuts. Cut the threaded bar long enough to make up the shortfall and use the connecting nuts to join it to the end of the handbrake cable. Double-nut the connecting nuts with normal nuts to stop them unwinding\n<br> 2/. Cut the later too-long cables at the handbrake end. Overlap the cut ends to take out the slack and use wire rope clamps to secure, or loop the cables to take up the slack and secure with the wire rope clamps.\n<br> 3/. Cut the later too-long cables to length at the handbrake end, discard the off-cut threaded ends and fit wire rope fittings with threaded ends.\n<br> \n<br> Option 1 is quickest and easiest. Option 3 looks best, but is hardest to get right. I've been running with option 3, but have this evening pulled the cables out to replace with stock cables as per option 1 above as I couldn't get the cable lengths even, so had uneven handbrake effect.\n<br> \n<br> The previous owner of my truck avoided the problem by doing away with a handbrake altogether when they fitted a big nut tranny. They even ditched the mechanism in the drums (lever, spreader bar etc). They just looped the disconnected cable ends at the wheel end around the torsion bar. The previous owner ran a VW garage. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\">",

Passenger side F tight and split pin fitted, over to the drivers side, get it F tight but the hole doesn’t quite line up, so give it a little more and boom, my new breaker bar is broke and the split pin isn’t fitted \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> \n<br> \n<br> No pictures as the pub was calling and a broken breaker bar is pretty uninspiring. \n<br> \n<br> Saturday 2nd March is rugby day, Leicester Tigers at home, train at 10am, pub by 12 and we won!
