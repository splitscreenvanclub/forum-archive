We originally went economy with the TDi but quickly realised that performance TDi's arent that much better than petrol. When Vicky said she really wanted to go aircooled, we went Type IV and I added a turbo to the mix for the extra go. Its evolved!\n<br>\n<br>Interior wise, we are trying to make it look quaint and based on original colours and materials wise. The front seat will be a custom job, it will turn into a bed, and face backwards or forwards to provide seating for camping etc. The rear bench will be fixed upright and have Isofix points. There will be a little cupboard in there too. So fairly normal, if thats possible.",
