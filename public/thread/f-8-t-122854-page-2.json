    "content" : "We wanted to get the body sitting over the restored chassis so we could make a start to the repairs on the body. We removed the remains of the original inner valance so the body would sit at the correct height on the new inner valance on the restored chassis. Also removed the remains of the front bulkhead that had previously been hacked out, and the patched up lower B posts so we could see how the new bulkhead from BBT fit. \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1938951.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1938952.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1938953.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Body sits nice on the chassis and everything seems to line up as expected, but the new bulkhead isnt as good as we had hoped. Id never fitted one before and every other panel from BBT has been good, but the shape at the top of the panel where it meets the B post isnt right and will need some work. I know the bulkhead is the wrong one but my customer isnt bothered. I would be if it was my bus, but its not, so this one is going to be fitted - overall its not bad at all.\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, we had a good look at the rear section of the van, and luckily the area where the fuel tank sits and the surrounding metal that we need to re use dont look too bad. The inner framework under the bed looks pretty good too. Will know more when its stripped down... but its pretty grim under there:\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1938949.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

Seems to fit really nice, just need to get the seat mounts spot welded onto the panel before its ready to be fitted:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1939525.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Hoping to get everything blasted next week.",

There were a couple of holes on the dash that had been drilled below the fuel gauge, apparently one was for a switch for a sump heater for the cold climates, and another was a warning light to show when a trailer was attached. Pretty cool, but here they are welded up:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1939827.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The rear seat mounts were welded in.

    "content" : "More recent work on the Crew cab...\n<br> \n<br> I repaired the panel above the gearbox that was rotten where both engine side trays meet it. Did the same repair both sides:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946357.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946358.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Then, the repair panel we made was welded in and clamped in place while we trial fitted the other new panels:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946350.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br> The new top hats and side supports were clamped in place to check everything was good before any welding:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946351.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The side panels and rear corners fitted quite nice. The rear engine lid hinge panel needed a bit of work, and the sides supports still need lengthening at this point, but now we were happy with the top hats etc they were welded in place. The engine lid hinge panel was twisted, with the corners and engine lid fitted the gaps were awful. After some work they are a little better but still need more work:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946341.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> We trial fitted the gates at this point to see where the captive nuts needed fitting into the side panels of the bed framework, and to check the mounting area on the BBT engine lid hinge panel and rear corners. None of them lined up \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> But they will be OK with a bit of work... Looks a bit like a finished bus:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946348.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I spot welded both side panels to the smaller side panel at the back of the cab that meets the bulkhead:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946344.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946343.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The lower hinge section of the post was repaired with a Klassic Fab panel.

Pretty pleased with this:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946346.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> There was so much work in all the above. Working with a mixture of panels from Klassic Fab, Autocraft, and the new BBT panels in weld through primer... All pretty good but all need work. The rear corners are not great. The holes for the gate hinges are in the wrong place, and the shape isnt perfect, but they are good enough overall. Just to show how much modification these panels need - here is the original battery tray, with the new Autocraft panel on top of it. Completely different shape where it meets the corner... And, neither of those panels fit the new corner. No big deal, we will just reshape the new panel when its fitted to fit the new corner:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946340.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br> A little repair I forgot to mention - The radio holes were slightly damaged, so they were repaired and are now have the correct size hole. Before:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946336.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> After:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946337.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> And the other side:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946338.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> RHS inner B post panel tacked in place, and side panel pinned in place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946562.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> New bulkhead trial fit with new B post:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946563.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Side panels and corners lined up and pinned in place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946564.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1946565.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> As far as I know no one makes rear tubs for a truck so we modified a pair of tubs from Autocraft to clear the vents as the originals. We mocked them up with the side panel, marked where they needed to be re shaped, cut them then got them in the stretcher and worked the edge until they were fairly straight:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948492.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948493.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The shape along the lower curve at the end of the sill wasnt the same profile as the rear side panel:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948494.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> If we would have left the tubs like this, the side panel would have been a mess after welding them together so we reshaped them. The rear closing panel had a nice curve that matched the side panel, so that was used as a template:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948495.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> You can see the difference with the template over the tub:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948496.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> After a bit of reshaping just using a hammer and dolly:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948498.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948497.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Much better fit with the side panel:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948499.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> The side panel and tub were fitted and pinned together, then removed to finish welding the tubs:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948501.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948500.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> We welded the top cuts in the tubs and spot welded the new side supports:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948513.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948504.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948512.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> We spent ages getting the door gaps nice and making sure the body was in the right position over the chassis forwards/backwards and left/right. Once happy we pinned everything into place:\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948506.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948507.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948508.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"https://www.thesamba.com/vw/gallery/pix/1948509.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Thats where we are at the moment.\n<br> \n<br> Cheers",
