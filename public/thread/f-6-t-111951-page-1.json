    "content" : "So I went for fish and chips while the family waited on the sea front in the bus. We've been driving around North Norfolk all week and all that day.\n<br>When I got back to the bus I noticed I'd left the lights on. But I hadn't been long.\n<br>I went to start the engine, but nothing happened. Red and green light on, turn, nowt, not even a cough.\n<br>Perhaps I'd forgotten to turn the immobiliser off (that has the same effect) but no, the immobiliser is off.\n<br>So then I turn the lights off and try again and she starts.\n<br>\n<br>Awesome. Think nothing more of it.\n<br>\n<br>The next morning we all pile in the bus again for a day trip.\n<br>And she wouldn't start.\n<br>Same as the night before.\n<br>I have the red and green lights on, I even have power to the main lights and interior lights.\n<br>\n<br>So I go to the back and check all the wires.\n<br>Everything seems fine. I wiggle everything on the dizzy and coil, one of the wires on the coil seems loose, I close the spade up a bit and it fits snugly back on the coil.\n<br>All battery connections seem fine.\n<br>\n<br>I go and try the ignition again and she starts.\n<br>\n<br>awesome. \n<br>Must be a loose wire. Think nothing more of it.\n<br>Drive all day stopping and starting fine.\n<br>Drive all next day all good.\n<br>Drive home today (150 miles) all good.\n<br>Parked for 3 or 4 hours and I go to move her and guess what? \n<br>Nothing.\n<br>Not a sausage.\n<br>Still have lights as before but she won't turn over.\n<br>I can hear the solenoid clicking as I turn the ignition.\n<br>I check all the wires.\n<br>And I go and get my jumper battery pack.\n<br>I hook that up and she starts first time!\n<br>\n<br>Awesome.\n<br>Now I'm not going to think nothing of it.\n<br>I want to know what's up.\n<br>I'm off to Dorset tomorrow morning.\n<br>I've left the battery charging. The dial on the charger was quite low when I connected it. \"Charging current 5amps\"\n<br>I don't have a multimeter (but I'll get one tomorrow).\n<br>\n<br>The only other thing that was odd while we were away was that the bus was parked next to creepy church while we were in Norfolk and as I came out to finish packing the bus this morning there was an injured pigeon flapping behind it, blood all over the road and the tailgate.\n<br>\n<br>So what could be up?\n<br>Is it that the alternator hasn't been charging the battery? \n<br>And not enough juice to start the engine? (It's a new Bosch silver battery)\n<br>But if so, why is it ok on some days and not on others?\n<br>If the battery was flat would the lights still work?\n<br>Why would it not charge the battery? What could I check?\n<br>The red light doesn't come on when I'm driving.\n<br>\n<br>Could it be a loose connection?\n<br>Where would I look? (The 2 wires on the alternator seem fine)\n<br>\n<br>Could it be supernatural? Or the Norfolk locals trying to drive us out?\n<br>\n<br>Sorry for the over elaborate post \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>Any pointers appreciated!\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

    "content" : "Don't know if I really have an answer but I had a similar issue (and never once parked near a spooky church or encountered blooded pigeons)\n<br>\n<br>I first changed starter motor - seemed to fix it but still refused to start occasionally. Next to go was the ignition switch (this was definitely faulty as manipulating it could get it going). All was then fine for months until stopping off at services and it refused to start - tried it a couple more times and it started. \n<br>\n<br>No problems since at all but have recently had engine and gearbox out and changed starter motor bush at same time....although this was not the main culprit for all the issues I suspect it was contributing to some of the random non start moments similar to what you describe.\n<br>\n<br>Just been camping in North Norfolk myself over past 10 days... locals seemed friendly enough \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/biggrin.gif\" alt=\":-D\" title=\"Very Happy\">",
