    "content" : "Hi all, \n<br> \n<br> Iv just negotiated the sale of one of my buses, to a fantastic chap in the USA, Minneapolis. I have said that I will help arrange shipping of the bus to his nearest port. The bus is fully restored and driving. \n<br> \n<br> Truth is, neither of us have experience of shipping a car, so its pretty new for us. I was wondering if any of you guys would mind pointing me in the right direction. \n<br> \n<br> - Is there any companies that you would recommend? \n<br> - From what I have researched, there is indeed a port in Minneapolis, however not many, if not any, actually ship there. Therefore, where would you recommend in regards to the nearest port? \n<br> - In terms of the transfer of funds, how would you go about it? Obviously we both want to be protected, and if the truth be known, I dont want to let that bus go out of my control until I have the full funds. That said, also from the buyers point of view, he may also want some security. So how does one go about coming to a compromise in these situations? Or is there a set way of doing it? He is a great chap, but you can never be too cautious with these types of things. \n<br> I will personally deliver the bus to any UK port that is required. \n<br> \n<br> Sorry for the lack of knowledge here , but looking forward to any advice you have. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers, \n<br> \n<br> John",
