The drivers side was practically bald on the inner edge before the Red9 and I've had so much different stuff done to the front trying to sort it out that the front tyres had started to scrub back in October last year. \n<br>Hopefully it's all sorted now and I know the alignment is spot on and I've got new tyres so I shall be keeping a beady eye on them.",

    "content" : "So back to my gunk encrusted front wheels......\n<br>The first one was a bit of an experiment really as I wasn't sure what to use to get all the crud off. It had set literally rock solid. First attempt was paint thinners on wire wool. All that did was give me a headache and dissolve the gloves I was wearing and dry my hand out \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> Next up was alloy wheel cleaner and wire wool. That was slightly better but I had to keep wiping over the bits I'd cleaned more or less straight away or it just set solid again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> I did one wheel using a combination of the two then finished it off with some emery cloth just to smooth off the alloy after I'd finished. \n<br>On the second wheel I tried another approach and went for the wire wool without anything on it and found that this worked better but created a lot of dust. Cue the 3M mask and very sore fingertips after spending about 3 hours total cleaning up both wheels. Again I finished it off with some emery cloth to smooth the alloy. The biggest PiA was getting into the bits that are on the mounting face of the rim as it was a one finger wrapped in emery cloth job. \n<br>Anyway, I persevered and this was the end result, which if you compare it with what I started with I don't think is too shabby. Although as it's the back of the wheels I wonder who's ever going to see my efforts \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zps27fe6xsw.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i991.photobucket.com/albums/af40/empi1/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpsaiwqaedd.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I've had a look at the back of the rear wheels and thankfully they're just a bit grubby as they've never been on the front by the look of things \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>My spare on the other hand \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> But that's a job for another day.",

Must've weighed quite a bit as we has a couple of bits of tyre rub as we drove along the A127. \n<br>Mrs Empi drove the bus for the first time as well \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> But only in the queue and in 1st gear \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> because we got there and there was a massive queue to get in and I was busting for the loo \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> So I jumped out and she trundled it along for a few minutes. \n<br>Had a look at the tyre wear and it all seems pretty even at the moment but I'm keeping a beady eye on it. The ride quality is perfect and little Empi can happily snooze as we drive along now and we don't get thrown out of our seats on every bump. \n<br>\n<br>So, the burning question...........is the Red9Design worth 2 and a half grand?\n<br>I would say YES definitely as the ride quality is similar to a normal car, the steering is so much more precise and it's made the driving experience as a whole much more enjoyable and not as fatiguing on long runs. It also means mrs Empi doesn't mind going out for a drive in it now as it's not shaking her t*ts to the point where they're almost falling off \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> and little Empi doesn't run the risk of shaken baby syndrome. \n<br>I'm going to start playing about with the damper settings a bit more over the next few weeks so I can get datum points for driving with no load, just passengers, full load and full load with passengers. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
