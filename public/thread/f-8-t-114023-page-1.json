    "content" : "Well after ending up with a little cash left over after my 65 Standard Microbus was written off and then repaired by Matt Smith, I decided to buy this little project.\n<br>Its my favourite split, a early RHD Double cab. Its from South Africa and has had some \"African\" repairs done already. These included fitting the wrong front panel and cab doors, along with outer sills hand crafted from rusty thin sheet. Just about everything of any worth has been stripped off it as well, just to give me something to look out for.\n<br>Any way this is what it looked like when it was still in South Africa.

The roof is sunburnt but no serious rust. The drop gates are not too bad, definitely saveable. The pick up bed had the top panel missing but the supporting frame work not bad. Both rear arches have been cut, but the inner wheel arches only rusty on front edge. No interior fittings or seats. Cab doors have been replaced with later ones. Front panel replaced (but only tacked in place) with a slightly rusty later panel. Lower 6\" missing or very crudely repaired.\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11657&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11657&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1230.JPG\" title=\"IMG_1230.JPG (73.43 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>So I installed it in my garage and started stripping stuff off\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11658&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11658&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1231.JPG\" title=\"IMG_1231.JPG (72.79 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>The front panel was just tacked on so after the cab doors that was the first panel removed, so I could see what was left underneath.\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11659&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11659&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1233.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1233.jpg (68.88 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>There was nothing left of the front valance so decided to fit inner valance to put a bit of strength back in.

The doors I had weren't very rusty, but were the wrong age and both bottom hinges were missing. If they were the correct age (they are for later push bottom handles) they would be very easy to repair and use (if anyone wants them feel free to make an offer!) but I decided to find some rot free correct doors. I needed the early ice pick doors without indents where the handle fits , but there isn't a lot of them about and for sale. I eventually found a set on thesamba in California (from Cory \"Blackdog\") and got them shipped here in the back of a bus that Dean Jones of Classic Car Revivals had purchased from Cory. This worked very well as the shipping would have been more than the price of the doors and Dean only wanted very little for them to travel in his bus.\n<br>While waiting for these doors to arrive I had a go at the main chassis rails behind the front beam. I removed the beam, which naturally is the wrong one but will probably get used as it rust free even if its from a later bus! The chassis rails behind the beam \"sounded\" strangely solid but were covered in rust blisters.\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11663&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11663&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1235.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1235.jpg (65.67 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>When I cut out the rusty metal I found the whole inside of the boxed in part of the front chassis rails was full of South African soil!\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11664&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11664&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1236.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1236.jpg (61.74 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>So I dug it out\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11665&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11665&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1238.JPG\" title=\"IMG_1238.JPG (106.9 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>After my Wife had claimed the \"lovely red soil\" for planting something in, I welded up both sides of the chassis rails.\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11666&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11666&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1241.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1241.jpg (60.07 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11667&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11667&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1245.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1245.jpg (58.21 KiB) Viewed 930 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>The inner front arch above the chassis is rust free and when the under seal was scraped off looks ok.\n<br>I'll leave it there for now, but will post some more later.",

The original was quite rusty along the bottom edge and behind the inner front wheel arch.

When I got to where my sat nag said they were there was just a bungalow and a couple of barns. I looked about but couldn't see any sign of people or VWs. It was then I realised I only had Deans email address with me. Just as I was beginning to worry about finding him a roller shutter door on one of the barns started to open and there was Dean and a selection of VWs. Had a chat about buying stuff from the USA without seeing it and Dean told me he had met Cory who I had bought my doors from and he was a sound guy who he had bought various vans and bits from. Also said he regularly imported vans from America so if I had any more bits to ship to give him a call as it may well coincide with him shipping another bus. \n<br>Returned home and bolted doors on.\n<br>\n<br>I",

The bottom edge of the panel between the front wheel arches and under the seat was rusty, so cut this back and repaired with an off cut front the repair panel for the bulkhead.\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11914&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11914&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1378.jpg\" title=\"IMG_1378.jpg (77.45 KiB) Viewed 654 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>Before welding into place, I wanted to fit the front cross member ,outriggers and top hat section. When I tried to fit these, I couldn't work out why the top hat section was shorter than the combined length of the outriggers and centre cross member (I'd been working all day I was a little worst for wear!) Came in and asked advice on forum, but couldn't work it out. So I gave up and had a bath and went to bed instead.\n<br>The next day went back out to garage, and straight away saw what was wrong. Where I had repaired the front chassis without the front beam and no cross member, the chassis rails had twisted slightly and move apart slightly. So I realigned the chassis rails with some sash clamps and welded the cross member, outriggers and top hat section into place.\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=11917&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=11917&amp;t=1&amp;sid=96a5337eeb1dd034acd176162797609e\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_1384.JPG\" title=\"IMG_1384.JPG (67.97 KiB) Viewed 654 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>\n<br>To hold the bulkhead in place to weld I used a very special tool.
