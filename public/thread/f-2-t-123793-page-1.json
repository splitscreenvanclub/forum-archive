    "content" : "Is this a real question? \n<br> \n<br> Are prices going up or down \"a bit\"?? Do you mean trends overall for all buses, or specific models in specific conditions?? There are so many variables involved it is impossible to answer this. \n<br> \n<br> If money/price is your main concern, just look at other same spec/condition buses and what they are going for. Google makes it very easy.\n<br> \n<br> Do you want to maximise the profit on your bus or are you happy to sell it at a reasonable current market value??\n<br> \n<br> Perhaps you could sell it for what you paid and allow another family with young kids to know what it's like to experience the joy and pleasure of camping and touring around the UK and maybe Europe??? We are all just guardians of these amazing vehicles. It's a lifestyle, not a cash cow.\n<br> \n<br> Pass it on.",
