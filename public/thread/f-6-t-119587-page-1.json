    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br> \n<br> Apologies for my lack of knowledge regarding this job, but it's something I have never done.\n<br> \n<br> Can anyone provide me with some guidance (or a link to a tutorial) on how to adjust the steering box on my 64 split, and also how to change the oil?\n<br> \n<br> I realise that you have to adjust the locknut &amp; turn the screw, but by how much?\n<br> \n<br> Also, the fluid appears to have been leaking our for some time &amp; looks very gungy around the bottom of the steering box.\n<br> \n<br> How do I flush out the old oil &amp; what is the best stuff to replace it with.\n<br> \n<br> Think I have herd tractor grease is good stuff to use, but as it's grease, I assume it's not as easy to completely fill as something a bit more 'fluid'.\n<br> \n<br> Any help gratefully received.\n<br> thanks",

You must not leave the tight spot or it will damage the worm gear &amp; peg.",

The seal is dirt cheap and dead easy to fit. The only hard bit is if your pitman arm is stuck to the output shaft. I used a pitman arm puller and mine popped off easy. No leaks since.\n<br> \n<br> I was recommended a mixture of grease and oil before (DIY cornhead grease), but it didn't stop the leak. Changing the seal did.\n<br> \n<br> I didn't have any play in the bushes though. If the bushes are shot, changing the seal won't fix the problem for long.",
