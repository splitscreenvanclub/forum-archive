    "content" : "I have a set of NOS handbrake cables correct for my 57. There are a set of cables in place but they seem oddly short. See picture. At the top is where the gear shift rod starts and that's as far as the cables get.\n<br> \n<br> Anyone seen this before? There's nothing unique with a 57 is there that means the cables don't come up through the cab floor? \n<br> \n<br> The ones in place are way off the cable floor hole. There's no handbrake mechanism so maybe someone put 'new' cables on but they're the wrong ones?\n<br> \n<br> Just want to check before I go ahead and pull out the old cables.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"//images.tapatalk-cdn.com/16/01/21/886182a7094b61f3a5be68785df28c68.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

The fitting at the drum end is different to the fitting on the original split case (small nut) transmission brake drums, so they end up too short. Later cables are too long. You'll have to buy or fabricate custom cables.\n<br> \n<br> There are a few threads on here with options, but I used later cables and cut them down to length at the handbrake end. I fitted wire rope fittings to replace the original swaged-on fittings.",

Not sure if their cables are different lengths - it was just a theory in my head. That plate looks like what I think a 3/4 ton backing plate looks like, so that's that theory dead. My '56 truck has a later big nut rear end, so totally different backing plate, hence different cables.",
