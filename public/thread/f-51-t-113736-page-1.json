    "content" : "Hi there,\n<br>\n<br>Selling my 1952 Barndoor. I expect a few of the regulars here will recognise it, it was restored by Status VW, in fact there is a blog showing the restoration here:\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://statusvw1952van.blogspot.co.uk/\">http://statusvw1952van.blogspot.co.uk/</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>As far as I'm aware, please don't shoot me down in flames though, its the 3rd oldest surviving original van left. It has all matching numbers, and all the parts used are genuine NOS. Body off chassis restoration, its as perfect as you'll find a 52 van. Runs and drives perfectly, MOT exempt, and comes with the private plate 52 BD. All the parts are correct as per manufacture in October 52, I have an enormous list of each individual difference. Im just finishing off recommissioning it, as its been stored in various places since restoration, and a few parts needed finishing off (see my other post in technical)\n<br>\n<br>Its as good as you will find, and is as good underneath as on top.\n<br>\n<br>I'm rather illiterate with computers, so I have also included a link to the ebay advert here, so you can see the pictures.\n<br>\n<br>Ebay ad: \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=201481936688\">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll? ... 1481936688</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>My email address is \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:alfiebear1234@gmail.com\">alfiebear1234@gmail.com</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>My phone number is 07879812835\n<br>\n<br>Any questions I will answer quite happily. Van is located in the southwest of the UK.\n<br>\n<br>Price is 70,000 Or VERY VERY near offer, with plate included. It will on go up, and is only 8000 more expensive than a 1986 S1 RS turbo that sold recently. If you are interested, the van is probably worth double that in the US, and will only continue to appreciate.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for looking.\n<br>\n<br>Rich",

    "content" : "Hi Rich,\n<br>\n<br>Certainly not \"shooting you down\", but I was confused by your eBay add and wonder if maybe you've been misinformed when you bought the van? Maybe it's helpful to confirm a few things for you. If you'd rather I remove any comments then please let me know. Just trying to help.\n<br>\n<br>The van certainly isn't the third oldest original van in existence, in fact there are 3 older and more original vans parked in my garage alone! There are over 40 1950 vans known in the world, and over 80 from 1951. Some of these are massively original, unrestored vehicles, and others restored with minimal welding or panels replaced.\n<br>\n<br>The restoration, while apparently to a high standard, didn't use solely NOS parts, in fact many of the body panels were replaced using mainly reproduction KlassicFab panels. It s a nice looking bus but I think your ad is misleading. Perhaps it's worth amending the wording or having a chat with the guys who sold it to you?\n<br>\n<br>I wish you all the best with the sale, and please feel free to contact me if you want any more information about the bus as I've known it for years and am very familiar with it.",

    "content" : "Hi, thanks for the replies. I take any criticism well don't worry! Right, Ive added the pictures now, sorry, I have only worded the advert as the owner asked me too. I don't own it, I suspect a few people on here might know who does, but They are now in the south of France and not coming back to the UK. So They are in a bit of strife, so I offered to sell it for them. Why they told me this I don't know, but if busben knows the van, could you elaborate any more on whats correct and what is not. Its not my field, and I admitted that, so as for telling me its \"balloney\" Great, thats really helpful. I based the pricing, based on what they told me and what others seem to have sold for in the past.\n<br>\n<br>Any other interesting facts about the van let me know, or would someone be able to give me some sort of idea of a true value?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Rich",
