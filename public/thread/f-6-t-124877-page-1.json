From about 1975 onwards many replacement 1200 engines (D code) came built on universal cases that had cylinder openings that would take 1500/1600 pots. To make them 1200 VW fitted special 1200 pots with very thick walls. If you can find one of these cases they are usually in excellent condition as they had a very unstressed life! All you need for the bottom end is a 1600 crank and conrods plus some fresh bearings. Unless they have been cooked, they rarely need line boring. The legendary engine builder Laurie Pettit would buy up lots of these cases to build his engines and tipped me off about them. I may still have a few skulking around \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">",
