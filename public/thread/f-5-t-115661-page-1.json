    "content" : "Hi, Thanks for replying the tinware is for a fixed pedestal early 36hp engine up to 1959. I would buy brand new tin if i could find any one that sells any. It is a pretty undesirable engine as they dont make much power at 1200cc but i have no tinware for mine at all. I would also consider a knackered engine with all tinware but it would be a waste realy. The tin im after is above the barrels and below for the early heat exchangers. The fire wall panel and the rear valance tinware with the hole for a crank start handle. Thanks Neil",
