There is no other reason. The seller must know what they want for it as they will either accept, reject, or negotiate the offer.\n<br> \n<br> So say I see a front clip, its 'make me an offer as a price', I like it and want it to I go through all the hassle of contacting the seller, waiting for a reply, making an offer, lets just say I say, £200 and I then get an email saying, \"sorry thats too low\".... so then I send another back saying ok, £250. To which I get a response back saying \" I was looking for £300\".\n<br> \n<br> Why not just put £300 on the advert in the first place????\n<br> \n<br> I'll either think it's worth it, or an offer around that price.\n<br> \n<br> If your not sure of its value, do some research for ones past sold or put on EBay.\n<br> \n<br> It's now happened 4 times on two items. I ended up paying more for one of them as it was a BIN price and it was click to buy and post next morning.\n<br> \n<br> Or am I missing the entire point of 'Make me an offer'???\n<br> \n<br> (My front clip with prices was purely an example as i've never needed one)\n<br> \n<br> No animals were hurt in this rant....\n<br> \n<br> Thats it.",
