I would run a smear of sealant…personally, but doubt VW did\n<br>3. as above\n<br>4. look right\n<br>5. Forget about split screens….you have a T3 back end, everything you need will be for the T3 (except the nose cone)\n<br>6. you want a match pair of bearing covers\n<br>7. my handbrake cables entered at the top…not sure if thats flipped or not",

Do i flip the backing plates so the handbrake comes out of the top?\n <br>\n <br>\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>Will help were i can on my take or how i did mine.\n<br>\n<br>1. 6 gaskets does seem allot so would check everything is beaded correctly, think from memory mine was 1 or 2. it does need to be tight &amp; the axle tube drop slowly under its own weight. If to loose when on the bus under its weight can then show movemevnt.\n<br>\n<br>2. sealant for these areas hylomar or similar is enough. if you just use gasket the oil gradually impregnates it and it seals but easy to remove item &amp; re use if you wish. to seal both faces with sealant which impregnates gasket &amp; seals, good belt &amp; braces &amp; wont leak but destroys gasket on removal. no wrong or right but im belt &amp; braces.\n<br>\n<br>3. nose cone same sealant as hopefully not something you replace or service.\n<br>\n<br>4. Bearings seem right but at this stage use new &amp; good quality, Same size for SA &amp; easily available.\n<br>\n<br>5. Repalcement seals come in a kit for SA normally 2 gaskets, large &amp; small oring &amp; a split pin.\n<br>\n<br>6. Difference in this may just be outer size, so double check inner depths but not wise enough on differences in year changes of items.\n<br>\n<br>7. My backing plates &amp; drums are late T1 &amp; fitted so hand brake cable entry is at the bottom, right or wrong not sure but works fine sorry not sure on T3.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps a little",
