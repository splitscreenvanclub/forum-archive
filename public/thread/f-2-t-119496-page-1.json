    "content" : "I'm after a speedo solution, my vans original goes up to 80mph im presuming it works but is probably not very accurate anyway. At the moment doesn't even have a cable fitted. I have been looking for another type to fit, ideally in the original speedo pod in my bus. I know smiths do a 120mph digital one that seem to get good feedback but has anyone got a GPS speedo fitted and what sort? Can't seem to find one that will fit straight in without modification. There's loads of different types and sizes on the net but just wondered if anyone had any experience with this.",
