    "content" : "Hello there everyone I am going to introduce you to my first proper project. I found her in California when I went over to pick up my Singlecab with the 911 engine, which some of you may have seen for sale, and to chop up a couple of earlybays for parts.\n<br>\n<br>It was only through knowing the people I meet on my 1st trip that I came by her. I consider myself to be lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to have come across a van with a full original camping interior. Ok granted it all needs replacing but it's all.\n<br>\n<br>I did own a 59 double door which I made an interior from scratch. I took my time over it and did the best I could but I just felt like something wasn't right and I put it down to the rubber (t-bar) trim that finishes everything off, I just couldn't get it and after all my hard work it just didn't look done properly. \n<br>\n<br>Not so this time.\n<br>\n<br>All the original metal edging is still attached and there will be no need to measuer cut, measure cut, measure reashape etc as I'll have templates \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile\">\n<br>\n<br>I'll put some photo's up and tell you a it about the state she was in when I found her and work so far.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>SO, LADIES AND GENTLE MEN INTRODUCING........\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper011.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper005.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper005.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper019.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>She's seen better days.\n<br>\n<br>Before I tell you about the work so far, want to tell you about the state she was in and how I come across her.\n<br>\n<br>As I mentioned I found her in California whilst going to see a friend and collect some parts, it was this friend who put me onto her. I was told that a guy had left her on his driveway for 24 years without touching her. He had died and his widow wanted it gone and a chap had picked it up and it was him that I went to see, he lived about 20 miles from my friend.\n<br>\n<br>When I got there she was sitting on 2 flat tyres, a 2 seized wheels and generally looking sorry for herself, but I could see- now how do we say it - the potential in her \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>I didn't buy her straight away but had a think about it. At this point I would like to say that before I left England a friends father had asked me if I could find a splitty that didn't need too much welding, would be nice if it had an engine, and also a camping interior. I had flown to LA at my own expence to see a \"nearly rust free, just the floor needs repalcing\" and had found this monsterous piece of s**t. \n<br>\n<br>BEWARE OF CHEAP DEALS FROM THE U.S. THAT SOUND TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. THEY PROBABLY ARE !\n<br>\n<br>rear hing snapped \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>dent ( can't see it that well in the photo, but trust me .....)\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>door not aligning and not the screw for a hinge\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>front damaged and full of filler, headlight missing\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>bottom of door rusted through and if I remember did line up, in fact none of the doors lined up\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper011.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>cut dash\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper013.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Gapping rusty hole\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper016.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>another rusty hole , this time in the tailgate-with no glass\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper017.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>this one I liked, the lower hinge on the rear cargo door had at some point been bent back so that the hinge part conected to the c pillar was bent back into the body, and remember folks all you need is a new floor \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper020.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>front door when closed\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper021.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>the split pillar had quite a dent, no glass\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper022.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>rusty window frame, no indicator, and a bolt for a hinge.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/rustfree%20camper/rustfreecamper024.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The next day I called the guy and we agreed a price and I organised transport to take it back to Steve's place where I could have a go at doing something with it.\n<br>1st of all I had to get the wheels off but the brakes had siezed. Now I'm no mechainic, but Steve has only ever done VW stuff, I had to turn the wheels so I could gain access to the star wheels to loosen of the brakes.\n<br>\n<br>I ended up taking the wheel off putting 2 bolts back in and gtting a massive leaver bar and hanging off it. the wheel gave a little at first but was still stuck, after while I could move it about 2 inches quite freely by hand but only 2 inches. I though this a bit odd, even more odd was the mud coming out of the holes for the other 3 bolts, I put the screwdriver in and had a fiddle, there was something in there-mud, or rather the nests of these bugs out there. \n<br>\n<br>So the wheels weren't siezed after all, just the drums full of mud mud. Handy.\n<br>\n<br>Fortunately for me Steve had some wheels lying around he said I could have so later in the day I could move her about. the hand brake worked but not that well.\n<br>\n<br>The interior was all there, just ratted a bit. The last owner must have been a bit of a hippy as the whole thing was a bit of a 70's time capsual.

    "content" : "Excellent find! It's great to find a van with real history and one that has been enjoyed for decades. I love the tassels and the covers and the 8 track (yes I remember them but a tad too modern for me). The old girl looks pretty solid and straight. Are you sure it was mud in the rear hubs? One of my cali vans had the rear hubs full of insect (wasps?) nests built from a sandy substance - I think they were using the rear inspection holes as an entrance. My advice is to get her up and running, clean up the interior so she's liveable, get an MoT and registered ready for next summer, and take her camping. Then sort the interior and body next winter.",

    "content" : "thanks for the input BJ1.\n<br>\n<br>I have some more photo's to post and the include some more of the \"cali mud beast\" but I really don't think it was wasps, i'm sure Steve said it was a \"worm\" but I've found their nest at the top of the bulk head and under the windows etc.\n<br>\n<br>I've viewed other peoples post on their vans, lee - the young guy with a split- is really interesting but has just made me realise how much work is involved. If I had the skills and the place i would find the time but sadly I'm short on all three. \n<br>\n<br>i have put an ad out there for a welder needed in trade for parts in bristol and have had a responce from a guy who needs a rear 1/4 section for an early bay so hoping to trade parts for labour and some cash or more labour but he lives in St Austell and I think he has a family but there is an agreement in the making i'm sure.\n<br>\n<br>More pics to follow, of the front floor esspecially for the welder so he knows what to expect, basically it's shot with holes you can stick your feet through. I have a new front floor, so with the prep done he can weld the floor in and a few other bits and we'll all be happy. Failing that I'll be buying my own welder and this is going to take some time. I hope not. I'd like to have her out and about next spring. I did get a quote on having her welded up and sprayed-to a really high standard mind- but it was way out of my league. \n<br>\n<br>My ultimate plan is lowered with drop spindles and IRS. new brakes-to include discs at the front but not sure if porsche is worth the extra expense, I've got new pop out frames and seals + a set of steel wheels and will powder coat the same colour as the front and rear safari's I got from Wolfgang(STEVE) and then there's the engine and the elecs which there is a problem with at the moment but I might be able to fix that my self.\n<br>\n<br>Well there's the plan now it's just putting it into reality. \n<br>\n<br>And on top of everything else I'm training for the London Marathon next year and also want to do some Triathlons some more Marathon's which hopefully will include the New York Marathon next year and before 23rd May 2011 complete an Ironman, so i'm going to be busy.......",

Let me tell you that is a tall order most vans are stripped of the interior but he said if I could find one and get it back to the UK he had a budget for around £6K-£7K.\n<br>I had told him I had found this van and he wanted pics. but steve had dial up internet and, honestly, it would take about 8 mins to load 1 photo. after the computer crashing several times during the day I finally got to loading 5 at a time, do some work on the van, load another 5 etc. I think you'll agree she's pretty clean.\n<br>\n<br>straight gutters\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper018.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper017.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>little dent on the b pillar\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper016.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>bit of a problem with the cab floor !\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper015.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>ding in the wheel arch\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Straight front and surpizingly on rot around the front windows \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>seals under cargo door needs replacing\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i512.photobucket.com/albums/t326/jayvanman/white%20camper/camper004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>I managed to get everything done except 1 of the plugs, which I thought if I tried any harder to turn I would brake it so it stayed in there, and the starter motor. Now this thing had me stumped. For the life of me I could work out how to manage to fit it past the chasis and gear box etc. After some time trying I was considering taking out the engine, but it was all gravel and would have been a pain in the ass trying to balance an engine on a trolley jack on my own. Thankfully Steve got home shortly after and although I didn't like asking him for help, as he'd just finished work he was happy to oblige. \n<br>\n<br>\"can't get it in there eh, let me have a go I haven't had one beat me yet.......oh.......hmmmm..........hmmmmmm\" came the mummering from under the van \"ok now lets........huh......\" for a moment I didn't feel so dum as if steve couldn't do it ...\" ah there you go\".\n<br>\n<br>ok but it nearly had him.\n<br>\n<br>So now with everything in place I jumped into the drivers seat put the key in the ignition and after her sitting for 24 years I turned the key and..........nothing. Not a sausage. No click nothing. but there was a little yellow light ( if I recall correctly) \n<br>\n<br>OK so there was a wiring problem.\n<br>\n<br>\"Don't worry we'll try and bump her\" and with a bit of rope she was pulled around steve's drive area. I had her in second and lifted the clutch and with a cough and a splutter and some smoke the rope came off, but it did sound like she was trying. again we tried and again cough cough cough then a splutter. She was getting somewhere so we tried again. splutter splutter splutter cough she caught coughed and then after 24 years of sitting idle she spluttered and smoked her way back to life. \n<br>\n<br>I couldn't believe my luck. \n<br>\n<br>She was running , but definately needs some major attention, smoking and the plug I couldn't get out wasn't probably working but she lived again. \n<br>\n<br>Steve - you the man !\n<br>\n<br>That's all for now, I want to post this before I lose it like I did the last time, more again soon",

    "content" : "I had been driving here for maybe 2-3 weeks and the reason she was driving funny became apparent when I stopped to get directions. As I got back in I noticed that one of my front tyres seemed bald. It was, but only one side-alignment. The tyre was almost showing wire and the other side like new. The guy in the garage told me if alignment is out by 1/2 inch it's bad. my steering arm bar had been bent and my alignment was out 1 1/4 inches ! I shortly after bought my double door and drove her instead and put the singlecab into storeage.\n<br>\n<br>Both vans were shipped together and collected a really nice guy by the name of DAN, if you need a vehicle moved you should use him. very reasonable and takes good care of your prized possention.\n<br>\n<br>DAN CAR TRANSPORTER 07971 557 480.\n<br>\n<br>During the time it took for the container to arrive I had asked a farmer/B N B if I could store my 2 vans for a few months and they were delivered by Dan together where they sat for about a year.\n<br>\n<br>The single cab failed to sell at santa pod and I ended up selling her on ebay to a guy from Germany.\n<br>\n<br>But back to the sundial.\n<br>\n<br>At the begining of June I started work again and earning some money and decided it was about time I did something about the Sundial.

    "content" : "Hi Jason,\n<br>\n<br>Tassel-tastic!\n<br>\n<br>Seriously, that's a great interior. I've recently got more of my 65 EZ interior together (got a fridge and water/tap unit since you came over to the Dub Shop).\n<br>\n<br>My two pennorth on the welding-versus-cost thing. I know where you're coming from, but I'd say after being round buses a lot while mine was done, and having seen everything from home-brew bodge to .... to semi-pro work come in...you *do* mostly get what you pay for. I also thought about buying my own welder and having a go if I ever get another bus, but in reality it's not going to happen. It's obvious from what i've seen that good welding takes a lot of experience, and years of experience working on these buses, knowing the fabricating tricks, and all the little tricks and short-cuts, and pit-falls. What seems expensive at the time usually isn't in the long-run. Whether you choose to use Clive or someone else (you seem to have decided that already), I'd get the job done properly. Anyone can buy a cheap mig welder and some grinders, but I think it comes down to experience. Maybe I would say that - and I'm not tryign to promote anybody - but I just dont think a good job can be done cheaply. God knows we'd all liek to save a bit of money on these things \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Keep the updates coming....\n<br>\n<br>Ben",
