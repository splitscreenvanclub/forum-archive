    "content" : "hello all, its that time again..... Oldtimers Cruize Devon XI ...... \"it'll be just right!\"\n<br>\n<br> \n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=64604\">viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=64604</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>\n<br>for those of you that don't know what its all about click on the link and let the pics tell the tale..... or carry on reading..... i am aiming this event at all types of us...... single, couples and families etc... so what i have been trying to do is get us all catered for. the cruize will include some good pubs that do good food, clean campsite (showers etc..) maybe a bouncy castle (if the kids are good), maybe another good pub, good likeminded people that enjoy their own and other split busses and all in north devon... can you just imagine 30 busses cruizin.. around and through the villages.... \n<br> \n<br>criteria.... it would be wise to have your bus all serviced up ( there are some entertaining roads), all of which i would be more than happy driving my old 59 up and down (or The Lounge). mums and dads are responsible for their own children. the cruize is all about start to finish, so you would need to be able to participate from start to finish (thurs 26th may @ 2.06pm till monday 30th may)\n<br> \n<br>what's included...\n<br>thursday 26th (with a full tank of fuel) we will leave junction 27 M5 then cruize to a campsite , where we will pitch up for one night (elec available). there is a club house onsite that do good pub grub, so after a long day on the road you can let your hair down..(remember we are back on the road in the morning). \n<br>fri morning aim to leave site 10.30/11am we all will then cruize some more, taking in some great views and some interesting lanes (very picturesque). this area still a bit vague!!! but it will come together .. (i hope), then heading to our next campsite, yet again elec available and a club house onsite to discuss the ups and downs .. \n<br>sat morning aim to leave 10.30/11am head back towards the coast, this is time to refuel.. after the day showing off..... in someway or another we will head to the next campsite via the super market to stock up. we will stay here for the final 2 nights (good campsite facilities, hot shower etc. no elec available here). there is a club house onsite, but the way i see it for the sat evening is you do your own thing, there are a few good pubs around . \n<br>sunday morning leave site for a day out location/car park still not decided (but i have a cracking plan....) but where ever we go (beach etc..) plan to stay there for the day. late afternoon cruize back to campsite, get freshened up ready for the last blast!!!! in the onsite bar (remember driving home the next day!!).\n<br> \n<br>hope you understand and like all the above, i know there are a couple of daytime places that still need sorting so i will update as soon as i know.\n<br> \n<br>also i am still blown away with all your generosity last year.... and i do not expect that again. but also i have tried to keep the price real!!! as things are still tight for all of us.\n<br> \n<br>now for the not so exciting bit..... i know funds are tight, and with an event like this we all have fuel, food, beer and general expences ontop of ticket price. so i have tried to keep it down to a minimum ( considering it's a bank hol weekend), the price is per split screen bus, ( 2 adults and up to 3 children) for 4 nights camping . Â£89.00\n<br> \n<br>if you are still interested and want to be a part of the O.C.D XI ....there are only 30 spaces available (including mine), so first register first in!....... please email \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:buzz1959@btinternet.com\">buzz1959@btinternet.com</a>\n<!-- e --> subject \"O.C.D XI im in\". with your details (names, bus reg and year ,who's in your bus and whether you would require elec). to register. so if you want to be part of the coolest cruize in devon, get registered..\n<br>\n<br>if you are one of the first 30 to register, i will reply telling you how to pay.... your place will only be reserved for a couple of weeks, so if you want in... get paid....\n<br>\n<br>if you are not in the first 30, i will still reply and let you know.... but if any one does not pay within the time scale and your next in line... you will be notified!!\n<br>\n<br>cheers buzz and look forward to seeing you all again.",
