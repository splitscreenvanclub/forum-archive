Located near Southampton, but we plan to bring the bus to Busfest.\n<br>\n<br>We are selling because it is my wife's bus and she can no longer drive it after a car accident 5 years ago. We hoped she would again be able to drive it, but this is not going to happen, so we plan to move up to a T5. We have kept it up to MOT standard every year. The children have now allowed us to sell the bus (we have had since before they were born), so it's time to sell and hopefully the next owner will get a further 15 years of enjoyment as we have had. Note, this is not one for the purists...\n<br>\n<br>Build date 28th Sept 1966 (I have the official VW letter to show this). Previously from the Swedish army (I still have one of the numberplates, and there is a strange “blackout running lights” switch on the dash – all in Swedish!), we purchased it from FBI in 2001. UK Registered by us in Dec 2001. MOT'd every year since 2001. Current MOT expires 28 June 2017.\n<br>\n<br>Exterior.\n<br>\n<br>Creative Engineering direct servo.\n<br>Dual circuit braking system.\n<br>Creative engineering IRS.\n<br>Late bay rear brakes with Wide 5 conversion plates.\n<br>Cogbox 1303 gearbox.\n<br>Wheels and spare rim powdercoated to match body colour.\n<br>Domed hubcaps painted to match body colour.\n<br>Wide 5 conversion plates on rear.\n<br>Commercial tyres.\n<br>Locking petrol cap (I have the original non-locking cap it came with).\n<br>Locking engine lid.\n<br>Pedal belly pan.\n<br>Ooga horn (I still have the original horn).\n<br>Underside fresh air scoop for engine.\n<br>Engine hot start relay.\n<br>Towbar and electrics.\n<br>External cab door steps pads on both sides.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Engine bay.\n<br>\n<br>Factory 12V electrics.\n<br>Epoxy coated original 67 fuel tank - ethanol resistant.\n<br>Ethanol resistant electric fuel pump (Facet Posi-flo with inline filter before pump) with priming switch in cab.\n<br>Electric fuel cut-off valve under tank with manual override.\n<br>Ethanol resistant fuel line.\n<br>Malpassi Filter King fuel pressure regulator (set to 3psi) and filter.\n<br>Fire suppression system in engine bay.\n<br>Twin ports 1600cc engine in AS21 case with new bearings, new gaskets, new crankshaft, new gland nut, new camshaft, reconditioned conrods, new pistons, new barrels, new cam lifters, new pushrod tubes, new bolt-up rocker shafts, new twin port heads, new crank pulley, new oil cooler, new 26mm oil pump, lightly used Wolksburg West heat exchangers, new SVDA vacuum advance distributor with electronic ignition system, new coil, new plugs, new leads, Bosch alternator. Note: the distributor shaft is installed 180° out. This engine only has around 500 miles on it.\n<br>Original VW Dog House fan housing with flaps and thermostat.\n<br>Brosol 34PICT3 carb.\n<br>Original oil filled air filter converted to paper filter.\n<br>Exhaust wrap on Bluebird standard stainless steel exhaust system.\n<br>Engine fitted with full flow filter system.\n<br>Additional remote oil cooler for towing.\n<br>Dipstick oil temperature sender. \n<br>Integrated electric hookup (with RCD) with 1x waterproof 13A socket in engine bay.\n<br>Leisure battery.\n<br>Battery isolator switch on both leisure and engine batteries.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Front Cab.\n<br>\n<br>Laminated front windscreens.\n<br>Front screen blackout cover.\n<br>Sun visors.\n<br>Gas connection for Propex heater under cab seat.\n<br>Heater outlet in cab (with open/close vent).\n<br>Unique children’s bunk bed system (2x Bluebird cab bunks) (the bulkhead panel that was removed to do this is supplied if you wish to refit it).\n<br>2x front inertia seatbelts plus centre lapbelt.\n<br>2x front adjustable headrests.\n<br>Rare Humpback front bench seat with seat adjustment brackets on base and back.\n<br>TMI seat covers.\n<br>Leather steering wheel cover.\n<br>Handbrake lever extension.\n<br>Butty's bits throttle kit.\n<br>Big foot accelerator pedal cover.\n<br>Fuel gauge.\n<br>Oil temperature gauge (accurate to within 4°C at 95°C and 110°C compared to alcohol filled thermometer).\n<br>Dakota cylinder head temperature gauge (currently measuring engine bay temperature).\n<br>Self parking twin speed wipers.\n<br>Kienzle round clock (from Karmann Ghia?).\n<br>12v socket running off engine battery.\n<br>CD stereo with door mounted front speakers and rear speakers in overhead locker.\n<br>Battery cutoff switch.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Rear interior.\n<br>\n<br>Heater outlet into rear on bulkhead.\n<br>4x 13A sockets.\n<br>12v socket running off leisure battery.\n<br>LED bulbs in original interior lights running off leisure battery.\n<br>Sink with external water pickup and external drain.\n<br>Stainless Smev 3 ring gas burner with electric ignition and sink.\n<br>Custom storage unit with gas bottle, regulator, floor vent and gas distribution/isolation taps for cooker, heater, and 3rd unused outlet (this was to be for a gas BBQ).\n<br>Custom-made rear overhead locker.\n<br>Original z-bed hinges for rear seat bed conversion.\n<br>2x rear inertia seatbelts (angle adjustable) plus centre lapbelt.\n<br>2x rear adjustable headrests.\n<br>TMI seat covers .\n<br>Custom-made magnetic thermal side window blackout pads (these took my wife weeks to make!).\n<br>Tailgate can be opened from inside without unlocking and there are also tailgate opening restrictors (so you can lie in bed and pop the rear open for fresh air without the whole neighbourhood seeing in!)\n<br>Rear Jailbars with red LED 3rd brake light across the rear window (these really get noticed by following vehicles).\n<br>Heat reducing film on side windows.\n<br>\n<br>Sadly, the Propex heater is NOT included (as my wife wants this for the replacement T5!), but all the gas and heating pipes will remain in place under the front seat. You just need to fit a replacement heater, connect electric, gas, and fit exhaust pipes underneath.\n<br>\n<br>The colours are BMC Old English white over British Racing green in cellulose paint. We had the body resprayed around 11 years ago, so it’s a little tired, but is does the job and has kept the bodywork in good condition. I still have 4 litres of white paint, 4 litres of green paint, and 2 gallons of cellulose thinners available in unopened tins! I can also supply the paint used in the interior units.\n<br>\n<br>We have just returned from a trouble-free 100 mile round trip.\n<br>\n<br>£17,500 although any sensible offers will be considered.
