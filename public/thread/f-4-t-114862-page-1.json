    "content" : "Trying to raise funds to finish another project, so putting my CE Air suspension weed-eater beam up for sale. \n<br>Purpose built, narrowed beam with inboard air bag mounts. \n<br>\n<br>It's only been fitted to roll the bus around my workshop, has a couple of chips in the powder coat from a careless courier but they would touch in with a bit of black paint easily (just being honest). \n<br>\n<br>It can come as a bare beam, or with the trailing/swing arms (stripped to bare metal then painted black to match the beam). \n<br>I might even be persuaded to part with my dropped spindles if you're interested in buying the full set up (and going very low). \n<br>It doesn't have any airbags fitted - I just sat 2 blocks of wood in there for rolling round my workshop as the floor is very flat and the bus is stripped to a shell. \n<br>\n<br>Will put up some pics after the weekend when it's not snowing and I can be arsed to go to my workshop!\n<br>\n<br>Price is £650 for just the beam, £750 with the trailing arms, and £1100 with the trailing arms and dropped spindles. Will not sell the dropped spindles separately - sorry. \n<br>\n<br>Also selling my air management kit in a separate thread - link to follow. \n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Mack",
