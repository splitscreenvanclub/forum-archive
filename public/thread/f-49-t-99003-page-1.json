Had a really nice 'curvy' look to it, natural wood finish, small sink etc. I saved the pages and filed them away safely....\n<br>\n<br>Its a long shot, but if anyone remembers the same article then I would love to know more about this interior as it is just what I want for my camper when the time (finally) comes.",
