    "content" : "1950 VW Kombi, Chassis number 6620.\n<br>\n<br>Due to an impending property purchase I have decided to offer my 1950 Kombi for sale. If you have been looking for a window bus this early you will know how rarely they come on the market. I was searching for this bus for 5+ years, and was very lucky to be able to do a deal on it to acquire it a few years ago.\n<br> \n<br>Chassis number 6620 was manufactured on the 24th November 1950, and left the factory on the 2nd December 1950, destined for Guerin Limitada, Lisbon, Portugal. 3 VW Transporters were sent to Portugal, and were assigned with registration numbers TS-13-06, TS-13-07 and TS-13-08, a type 21, 22 and 23. Only this one, TS-13-08 has survived. It appears that 6620 was used as a demonstration vehicle as it was not sold until 10 February 1951 when it was first registered and sold to its first owner, a construction company in Estarreja near Aveiro (A town 80km South from Porto).\n<br>We have no information about the 2nd and 3rd owners. In the 6th February 1969 it was bought by its 4th owner, another construction company this time in Coimbra (A town 120km South from Porto) who used it until 21 March 1982, the end of its insurance.\n<br>The following is part of an email from the previous owner in Portugal, Jorge Rodrigues:\n<br>“In 1985 I went to live in Coimbra in the Av. Combatentes number 64 and the address of the bus was number 69 in the same street. The 50 was sitting there filled with trash, but I didn’t know much about VW’s then. On the 21st June 1990 it was sold to an old car dealer in Vila Nova de Poiares, 20km from Coimbra, who used it to keep spares inside. In 1992 I saw it in the sun for the first time and made my first attempt to buy it but he wanted big money for it. 6620 was having its worst years. It was parked in the open in a national road for 5 years. In 1995 I went to Bad Camberg and realized how rare this bus was so I bought it. I am the fifth registered owner and did that in 9th April 1996.\n<br>The clutch wasn’t working so I put a new one in. I drove the bus every Sunday morning for a year or so but it looked so ugly that the police tried to fine me. So the bus is parked since then. I’ve owned this bus for a third of my life so now it’s your turn. I hope you can put the 6620 in its former glory. I did not do much on the bus but at least it did not get any rain.”\n<br>\n<br>Jorge then sold 6620 to Iain Branks, this is when it came to the UK. After numerous conversations with him about the bus a deal was struck and I became the 7th owner. Iain had already started restoration, so with the addition of some NOS panels and Klassicfab panels by Matt Smith, 6620 once again graced the roads and was UK registered and driven to Hessisch Oldendorf for its first journey in many years. New panels included cargo floors, outriggers, inner and outer sills, A pillars lower front panel, lower bulkhead and correct 1 year only doglegs from Klassicfab. \n<br>\n<br>A new loom was correctly manufactured to exact 1950 specifications, and the steering box and spindles were fully reconditioned. Luckily 6620 has never been stripped for parts, so still retains many original components such as its Veigel speedo and dash pod, steering wheel and horn push, along with its original ignition and key, to the original seal-less popouts with pressed latches. Some missing or broken parts were sourced and replaced, such as the cast front badge, and glass tail lights. Its running gear is currently slightly upgraded, with 59 front brakes mated to a dual circuit master cylinder for safety, along with a big nut trans and 1600 t/p out the back. New cylinders, shoes, flexis and hard brake lines were installed throughout. Also included will be a correct 50/51 trans needing restoration, stock front brakes and the 30hp engine that came with 6620. It sits on a set of original paint barndoor 16’s, and has been driven to numerous shows, including Hessisch Oldendorf, Ben Pon, and Le Mans Classic with no issues. \n<br>\n<br>At present I also have some other projects for sale which could cover my costs, so if these sell sooner I will retract 6620 from sale and continue to enjoy driving and camping in one of the earliest barndoors on the road. I am not looking to trade or swap for anything, and am looking for sensible offers for this van. Please, take a little time to have a think about what you want to offer if interested, I’m not easily offended, but these aren’t exactly growing on trees. To clear up any potential misunderstandings, offers should be made in GBP Sterling, any bank transfer fees are liable to the buyer, what is offered is what needs to be seen in my account at the end of the deal. I am more than happy for anyone to come and visit for a look, I am in Bristol UK, 20 mins from Bristol Airport, and can collect you from there. I hope to take a portfolio of pictures in the next few weeks and will make these available once I have completed them. Any questions, please give me a call/text on 07866618267, (00447866618267 if outside the UK) or email me on \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:streetwagens@yahoo.co.uk\">streetwagens@yahoo.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e -->. \n<br>\n<br>Asking price is £88,000 GBP obo. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114626.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114627.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114628.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114629.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114630.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114631.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114632.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114633.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.thesamba.com/vw/classifieds/pix/6114634.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
