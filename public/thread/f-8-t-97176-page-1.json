    "content" : "Hello you lot. Having lurked for far too long reading the adventures on this site, I'm proud to say I now qualify to join in!\n<br> \n<br> I've been derailed by a million reasons (well, 5 actually) since my first beetle back in 1986 but, I've finally bought this 1965 Westy subhatch, through Clifton Campers - importing in from Ohio this Summer (All went smoothly as promised by Ryan and Zoe, delivered more or less on time). I've had a couple of beetles over the years, but this is my first bus so it's going to be a lot of learning for me, not to mention wailing, gnashing, weeping and roaring drunkardly.... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br> \n<br> I could do with some advice on working out the Westy code - I think it's an SO33? \n<br> \n<br> Mcodes say:\n<br> \n<br> 025 US-spec bumpers and 6 pop-out windows \n<br> 025 Mounting for safety belts \n<br> 056 Steering/ignition lock \n<br> 119 Eberspacher BN4 gas heater \n<br> 191 Sub floor - belly pan \n<br> 430 North American export package including M20, M24, M25, M90, M175, M620, M621\n<br> 620 12v system (standard from August, 1966) \n<br> 621 12v warning light relay\n<br> \n<br> So it's missing the petrol heater, the steering lock is there but currently non functioning and keyless, loom is junk, hazard warning switch and relays gone, westy interior gone. \n<br> \n<br> What's left is all really solid from what I have poked around with so far. Welding needed so far all seems pretty lightweight - a few window frames, half a cab floor and some patching. Factory Bellypans are mint and have hopefully helped to hold the rot at bay. Paint is a mixture of OG SWR and BG, and loads of really nasty hand painted gloss \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\">, so I'm going to repaint. Despite a few nice patina areas, there's just too much goop (hiding too much bondo perhaps, or at least around one rear corner)...\n<br> Brakes are refurbed and upgraded with dual master cylinder, new lines, flexis, wheel cylinders etc. 1600 single port runs and pulls well, shifts well, although needs all new shift rod bushings etc.\n<br> \n<br> Anyway I suppose the picture will become clearer as it comes apart, but I think I'm going down the completely rock stock route, seeing as what's there is fairly un-messed with...\n<br> \n<br> What do you reckon? I have to say I'm super chuffed, and probably a bit blinded to any obvious potential nightmares, but do feel free to point them out to me!! In fact I'm really hoping I can share any major problems I have along the way with the collective minds in this club to stop me making a massive ballsup of it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_blackeye.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":blackeye:\" title=\"blackeye\"> \n<br> \n<br> Sorry the pictures are so rubbish - I've got a couple of weeks off now, and besides Busfest will be spending most of it on the van so I'll update with a load more I hope...\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Lawrence\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Buster-Enroute_zpsd5bd0eae.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Buster-Aug0_zpsc111eee2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Buster-Aug01_zps68159ab4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Buster-Aug1_zps7eb54d3e.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

I have the bows and most of the structure around the Sub hatch - even small remnants of the ply roof still attached to them... Has the grooves in the front to accept a board/ply cab headliner too. Started to identify the drilled holes dotted around the cab. It had brackets for a cab hammock, press studs for curtains around the front of the cab (all of which are going back in) and mounting holes for the curtain rail across the cab divider. I'm going to poke around the cabin tomorrow, I'll take some pics of the hole patterns (rock and roll \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> ...ahem). \n<br> \n<br> It only had one Jalousie window, and that was a 2 panel one (possibly non-original??). Anyhow I have that stored but it's fairly knackered and would prefer a plain glass to go back in - want to use this as my regular driver. Weren't original Westy windows 3 panel?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for the help Ben, top man!",

I have a question for the Westy experts here. Are these vertical mount holes there for wall lights? There is another set of similar holes just behind the B pillar I presume the other holes are curtail rail and retainer mounts?\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/WindowHoles_zps027bc774.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Also, a firm of soda blasters has just set up a unit near me (in case anyone in Swansea area was keen - Crofty Ind Estate). Really amazed how good a job they've done on the doors. Soda has just gently removed paint leaving all the witness marks in the metal from VW body shop - leadloading and braising all intact!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i918.photobucket.com/albums/ad23/lawrence681/Soda1_zps388a6847.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Doors had almost no filler, some welding to do on inner skins on the bottom of the cargo doors, and window frames on a couple.
