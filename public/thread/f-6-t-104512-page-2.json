Thats why its necessary to have the tubes on show really, as they need to protect this area and without tieing them into the chassis or the wheel housings via a small door bar, they would be useless, its one of those function over form quandaries!! \n<br>\n<br>My wife hates roll cages usually, but we have three kids in the back, and both my wife amd I like our legs so its a necessary evil.",
