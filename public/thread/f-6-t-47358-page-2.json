The only thing I noticed though on reassembly is that the taper is a midgers too large so the steering rod end goes in a little too far and the rubber boot presses on the idler. \n<br>\n<br>I've just had another look at it though and I dont think its the cause of the problem though.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/P9210001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I'm going to fit a Bug Box rack next time...",
