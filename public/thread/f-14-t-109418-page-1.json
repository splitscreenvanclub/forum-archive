Did he make a mistake moving from Ducati? \n<br>I would love to see Lowes up front in Moto 2, if only he can stop pushing too hard.\n<br>I think this year is going to be a good one,I just need to decide what event I'm going to,last year at silverstone was excellent,but I missed Assen and I would love to do Le Mans again ( good run for the van)\n<br>What do you guys think.",
