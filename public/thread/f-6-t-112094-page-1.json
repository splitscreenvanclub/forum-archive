    "content" : "Hi\n<br> \n<br> I have a 63 splitscreen sundial which I would like to undertake a full bare metal body resto on and need advice who to take it to. Potentially I can deliver bus as a shell and restore components myself. I am based in Exeter so South Devon or Cornwall would be ideal. I have tried ringing a few places but find it hard to get people on the phone.\n<br> \n<br> Help would be really appreciated!!\n<br> \n<br> Also if anyone has ball parks of rough guide how much welding not a horrendous amount of panels on as its solid bus strip and paint would cost. I am hoping may be able for 7k but want to know if I am dreaming!!!",

    "content" : "Trailer Queens also have a good name in that area. Not cheap. Autostyl used to turn out some nice cars too. \n<br> \n<br> If you're prepared to travel then more options open up: Irvs, Dave Haywood etc.\n<br> \n<br> Also consider separate people for welding and paint. Downside is it's more hassle moving and project managing it but you want your welder to know splits, whereas you can get anyone to paint it. \n<br> \n<br> Cost depends on how much rot you find, how well you repair it and how good you want your paint. \n<br> \n<br> E.g. I found pinholes in my rear bulkhead after blasting. Looked completely solid before but now needs replacing. \n<br> \n<br> E.g. my front valance was wrongly repaired in the past. Could have left it but wanted it done properly so had it cut out and a new one put in. Only a few hundred quid in parts and labour but multiply this across each area and it all adds up. \n<br> \n<br> Once it's welded, for paint you can pay what you like: £2k will get it covered in paint, £4-6k will look nice, £8-10k will win prizes.",

    "content" : "My two penneth. \n<br> If a Resto company can do your bus with less than 2 months notice if worry why. Good ones like those mentioned will be booked up way in advance. \n<br> \n<br> You said you'd pay £7k for a very good paint job and welding in some panels. I'd say if your paying someone else to do all the welding and paint prep work you'll have to budget for a lot more than that. Just the prep work from welding to base coats and prep works out at many many hours so your £7k budget will go quickly. If your going to do it, do it once do it properly. It might cost more but it will mean you don't have to redo it all in 3 years time. Matt smith is booked months in advance and is not cheap but there is a reason for that. \n<br> Good luck with your project. Make sure you start a Resto thread if you go down this route.",

Resto shacks work does look good, he's booked up for two years two but we are discussing things as he is taking more staff on for prep due to demand. Nothing firm as I just starting to plan. Good news is I finished 944 front brake conversion so it has brakes and can drive it for the first time!",
