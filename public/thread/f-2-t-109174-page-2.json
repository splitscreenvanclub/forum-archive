    "content" : "Petrol heater would solve the windscreen / cold problems . I've a diesel one in my works van and I love popping out to switch it on 10 mins before I leave for work, nice and toasty, v lazy though I know. I think you can get remotes for them too but never looked into it...\n<br>\n<br>Gritters would bother me most, ran a bug for years as a daily, as with many on here I'm sure, but the salt does take its toll eventually. With a bit of thought and work you could minimise this though I reckon. A good blast clean and re-wax every spring would probably hold most of it off if done well. Small price to pay when compared with massive garage bills on modern cars - crap incredibly complicated electrics with sensors all over the place!",
