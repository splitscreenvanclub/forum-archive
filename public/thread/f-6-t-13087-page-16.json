To use it in an IRS setup would require changing the side plates and diff components. It would be much easier to use a stock beetle IRS box and switch the nose of the stock box onto it.",

Anyone interested, I want £150 for it.\n<br>\n<br>But that's not the reason I'm posting. I'm looking at the prices of the SA lowering kits and they seem disproportionately expensive, you usually pay the same price in pounds as they are in dollars and you get accustomed to that, but US price for the bus boys kit is $350-ish, so why the **** do we have to pay £460 odd for them in Blighty?\n<br>\n<br>How easy is it to modify the axle sleeves yourself? What are the mods that the likes of Bus boys are doing to their axle sleeves? The spring plate rework look easy enough, that could be done in a machine shop. And then what do you need, a few gaskets etc? \n<br>\n<br>Maybe I'm just being tight fisted, but if one of you bright sparks could point me in the right direction, it would be appreciated. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
