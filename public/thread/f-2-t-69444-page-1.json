So Im slightly confused, can't find any info on the numbers behind the driver seat if they are vin related. There are holes for the plate above where the number should be i'm going to take back the paint in the engine bay to see if there's anything there. anyone know someone who could help point me in the right direction.\n<br>\n<br>regards\n<br>\n<br>James",

    "content" : "Your (missing) identification plate is where the VIN would have been James. I'm having trouble with mine, as although it is there is is so badly corroded you can barely read it. That is the 6 digit number I gave the VW for the Birth Certificate, and the one on my Log Book. (Regular MOT guy knows my bus, but when I MOT'd it last week he said I needed to make it clearer.)\n<br>\n<br>I have a chassis or body number stamped on the engine tin, just near where the valance joins. This is lovely and clear in big numerals, but I've no idea if you can use it to date or register a vehicle? If it's just a 'body' number, I would think not? I don't know if there are body number records that would help you trace your original VIN number?",
