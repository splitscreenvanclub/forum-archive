Belt line down almost done, but above the belt line seems like some kind of putty paint and is going to be very hard to get off!! Utterly spirit crushing work. Why didn't I listen to my golden rule...... Never buy anything but and og paint bus!! \n<br>\n<br>Does anyone have any tips for removing paint from all the tricky places like the hinges, rear vents, front panel seems etc?????",
