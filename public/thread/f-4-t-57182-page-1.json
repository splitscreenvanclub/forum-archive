The samba has some at $2 and one at $9!! Do you want me to see how many I have, get you a pic and then go from there? I think they are all in pretty reasonable condition as I didn't get any with my bus when I got it so I purchased these at dubfreeze and then forgot I had so foolishly purchased the repro ones as well - worst thing is I no longer have a deluxe bus either!!! \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

    "content" : "Ok Maddison (and others if necessary) I have 12 of the original trim end pieces, some are in slightly better condition than others but all not bad at all. I'm attacheing a couple of pics of the 12 pieces and one to show them against a repro one. Clearly the repro ones don't have such a long tab (cost cutting!) but as the originals only have one hole I guess it doesn't leave so much margin for error, this may be fine if you have original trim but not sure about aftermarket stuff. Having said that I guess you could drill more holes if you wanted. The holes are also in slightly different places on different tabs so I presume specific to a particular piece of trim.\n<br>\n<br>Drop me a PM again if interested still.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Steve\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q209/1966vw/d2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q209/1966vw/d1.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",

I have said offers as I don't know how much I should be charging for these but rather than expect eveyone to offer I'm going to try and be fair and do it on a first dibs kind of basis so Maddison is going to get first shout. If Maddision doesn't want all or any of them then I'll get back to each of you in turn.\n<br>\n<br>I still have the repro ones as well, not the same as original I know but nice and shiny by comparrison!!! I'm open to offers on these if my price is silly but I thought it was fair given that they are brand new and unused - guess everyone just wants original stuff.\n<br>\n<br>Steve \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
