    "content" : "Had an issue today with the van. After travelling for 40 mins she Just died, and wouldn't restart. Luckily we pulled into an empty car park.\n<br>\n<br>It is possible that my fuel gauge is playing up so we got a can of petrol. petrol in and it was trying to start, the odd time it would try and catch, but never run.\n<br>\n<br>whilst I was troubleshooting I noticed the earth strap was warm, not hot. But then it was 30-40 mins since we stopped.\n<br>\n<br>The copper connector was corroded (green). So I took it off and put on a spare (yes I was carrying one). It started , and I did 150 further miles with no issues.\n<br>\n<br>My question is - Would the earth strap getting hot reduce the connection voltage so much that it wouldn't get a good enough spark? Are the symptoms I experienced in line with this diagnosis? \n<br>\n<br>I will obviously give it a good going over tomorrow, is there anything else I should / could do? I seem to remember my grandad putting grease /petroleum jelly on his battery connectors, was this to stop the corrosion?",
