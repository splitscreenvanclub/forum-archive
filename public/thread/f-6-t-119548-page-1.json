    "content" : "Ok so all day today I've been trying to remove the flywheel nut on my 2276cc engine. First easy issue was it isn't a standard 36mm nut. Mine is a 38mm which I've used a 1 1/2\" socket that fits. \n<br> It's seized on there solid. \n<br> I've used a pry bar and a SNAP ON torque multiplier x 4 which would normally shift anything. No joy\n<br> I've tried a 6 foot scaffold pole over the pry bar and it's lifted the engine plus one adult off the floor. No joy. \n<br> I'm assuming the original engine builder used lock seal on the nut as some do and it's literally 13 years later glued it on. \n<br> \n<br> I've got a worn leaking main seal behind it so need it off. \n<br> \n<br> Any better ideas? \n<br> I'm thinking of heating it to burn off the lock tight. I don't possess a oxy set up though.\n<br> \n<br> Next step is two more mates to hang off 6 foot pole and no doubt snap the pry bar! \n<br> \n<br> Been a long wasted day. So any help appreciated \n<br> Thanks.",
