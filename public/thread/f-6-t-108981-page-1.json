Do the stock armrests fitted either side on the interior trim panels have to be removed to use a full-width rock and roll bed?\n<br>\n<br>2. What is the purpose of the large springs used with the cab door internal handles - and how should they be fitted?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks folks - no doubt I'll come up with some more trivia as the interior nears completion.\n<br>\n<br>Dave.\n<br>\n<br>(1962 23W Deluxe)",

But theses handles had a central screw to tighten the handle to the shaft of the operating mechanism.\n<br>On 1962 \"Sherry\" there were no large springs ....The POs at some time had covered the interior panels with black 70's padded foam vinyl ...so maybe the vinyl was too thick and they were done away with.\n<br>My belief was that the large springs were between the interior panel and the \"buffer\"...and you pushed the panel to compress the spring and fitted the pin to the hole in the handle.\n<br>I had real difficulty getting the pins out and chewed the back faces of my handles....But I do intend to reuse them after some TIC. ..",

Anyway, the handles (and springs) are now fitted correctly, but I doubt I'll ever get them off again.

Still haven't decided which way to go, so have fitted both side panels without the armrests for the moment. However, to give the panels support, particularly the long side, I have glued each armrest bracket onto the backs of the panels. I will just need to remove the panels again to bolt the headrests in place.\n<br>\n<br>Interior is now almost finished apart from the seats.",

    "content" : "The panels are actually 3mm ply, varnished on both sides before being covered. I initially fitted a waterproof membrane onto the cab doors using a silicone adhesive, which fell off when I started to fit the panels on top. I then secured them with adhesive tape - double-sided tape from the start would have been a better way. \n<br>\n<br>All of the original VW panels were made from hardboard, which is even less flexible than 3mm ply and would probably make fitting the handles and escutcheons even harder. Can't understand why VW didn't use a screw through the centre arrangement, like the cargo door handles - way simpler. \n<br>\n<br>BTW most of my raw panels were supplied by Jayvanman on here - nice job Jay, accurately cut, and long side panel in a single piece. However covering them in two-tone style was a lengthy and tedious business, with care needed to ensure that the bands and trim strips lined up properly all around the inside of the bus. I now understand why the TMI panels are so expensive!",
