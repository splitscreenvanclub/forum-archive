There is no straight migration of the old templates so I'm starting from scratch really (well not really as I'm just taking one of the base templates as a starting point). All I can say is the update has been a huge success from an admin perspective as I no longer get 120 spammers a day trying to register and we don't need to manually activate every genuine registration \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
