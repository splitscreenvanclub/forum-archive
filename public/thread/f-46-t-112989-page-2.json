    "content" : "My advice for sources of veneer is that whilst you can buy new pieces of veneer - they look too new! You need to look for old veneered pieces of furniture - I did this and got what I needed. I scoured the local papers for jumble sales/ car boot sales/ junk shops/charity shops etc. and looked for small pieces of furniture with pale oak veneer. You really do not want to pay top prices but more you want broken damaged remnants. I visited my local charity shops and asked if they would let me know if anything comes in. They conveniently put all their unwanted pieces outside for collection once a week, but these \n<br>get picked up by others quickly..\n<br>\n<br>In the end my pieces turned up when a local care home put out a lot of bedside cabinets and I got two nice pieces.. One will be the basis of the panels for my Devonette Front cupboard.. \n<br>These were quickly flat packed and the unwanted backs and ply panels turned into fire wood.\n<br>I was successful at steaming the veneer off a panel whilst retaining some of the patina surface finish.\n<br>I cut out pieces and let pieces in gluing with titebond wood glue, cling film and clamping strips and clamps. Screw fix do some excellent spring clamps at about £4 a pair…\n<br>After a gentle rub down with wire wool and French polish… the repairs look excellent.. any gaps can then be filled with light oak Ronseal Wax stick\n<br>\n<br>The picture you show of the slider grooves in the front red top cupboard which goes across the van and is attached to the division....\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- l -->\n<a class=\"postlink-local\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/download/file.php?id=9867&amp;mode=view\">download/file.php?id=9867&amp;mode=view</a>\n<!-- l -->\n<br>The holes were probably to take the oval nail which went down in the edge fillet for the hinged seat back to the front rear facing seat back..\n<br>I do not see these..\n<br>I can measure and put the dims on the drawings pages in my photobucket",

    "content" : "So you are going to start with the rear drawers.

This was attached with ten vw trim screws and cups.\n<br>I have a tracing of the one from Peebles.. just as well because it suffered from having got wet lots of times and whilst I was holding it with one hand horizontally the millboard gave up the ghost snd shattered into a lot of small pieces.\n<br>I used PVA glue and plastic wood and Humbrol to make it better..\n<br>Anyway the board is screwed down onto tarred fibre strips which fill the hollows in the pressing.\n<br>The three round the rear hatch lock striker are cut down so that they do not pierce the rear lighting loom which goes across the bus.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Then to the leg cupboard\n<br>\n<br>The \"missing\" short closing section sits on the frame and is held by two \"number plate\" capped wood screws. This covers a gap through from the cooker side on mine.\n<br>I will supply pictures If you require...\n<br>\n<br>The drawers you have look to be modelled on a 66 division bus.\n<br>Devon had realised by then that maybe not putting fixed covers on the drawers was an improvement. ..\n<br>You could lean over the rear seat and remove the cushion...lift the lid and access the drawer..\n<br>I belive the 66 had the black plastic covers in excess here. One on each drawer and one on the long leg cupboard lid... and one on each drawer top access lid. The lids also had black formica surfaces. .\n<br>\n<br>If you are changing the drawer handles to wood strips you may want to fit brass finger pull lifts like the 63...I have pictures in my photobucket type21f. .you may have found..\n<br>Overload..\n<br>Sorry \n<br>G",
