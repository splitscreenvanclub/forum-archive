It's the coupling (number 11) that has split into 2 parts, with each still connected to the rod (front) and the next section into the gearbox. If clamp these back together with mole grips then I regain a working gear shifter but there is no obvious way to bodge these together to allow me to dare drive home. There's no holes to pass a bolt or other fixing through. It looks like the 2 halves are bound together by some sort of plastic/rubber material that has failed over some time. Earlier today I was having trouble finding 2nd gear... It kept wanting to go into 4th instead. Before today I've had no other issues.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, I think the holiday has come to an abrupt end and a recovery vehicle is on its way. Glad I'm only 50 miles from home.",

I need another 10mm and have the selector rod pushed into the gearbox (not sure what gear it clicked into) and gear stick back in 2nd/4th position to bring the rear shift rod as forward as possible. How can I increase the gap? Will removing the gear stick assembly and loosening the front shift rod allow it all to slide forward more? Surely I don't need to drop the engine and gearbox just to fit this coupling?",
