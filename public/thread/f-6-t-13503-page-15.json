The bend would be too tight otherwise.\n<br>\n<br>FYI, the \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">rear</span> t-piece is a ***** to get at with the rear on its wheels - it sits on top of the upper engine mounting frame horns, so you can't see the bolt or pipe connections, and mine was buried in crud. There is also a pipe clamp for a brake line in the same position on the opposite engine mounting frame horn and was also buried in crud on mine.",

    "content" : "There are lots of references to adjusting the pushrod when fitting the DCMC but has anyone had an issue with the pushrod being too long to allow the required freeplay?\n<br>\n<br>My '61 project had no MC or brake pedal pushrod so I'm fitting a new dual circuit MC (from VWH) and new pushrod (from C&amp;C). They are both definitely correct for the year etc. and the MC is fitted correctly with spacer etc.\n<br>\n<br>But the pushrod seems too long? Even adjusted to make it as short as possible, its a tight fit with no room for any free play and is pushing on the MC piston.\n<br>\n<br>The brake pedal seems to be in the correct place (nicely aligned with clutch pedal and not stuck part way down) so that doesn't seem to be the issue.\n<br>\n<br>Shortening the pushrod by about 10mm looks like it would work but that feels a bit drastic for something that should have just gone in without a fuss.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone else had this issue and/or got any other suggestions? Can the brake pedal be adjusted somehow to give a bigger gap and if so how?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",
