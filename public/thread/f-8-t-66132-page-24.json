    "content" : "It's been a productive week, I was in the Brighton area earlier this week so stopped by VW Heritage and picked up my Barrel spacers and copper head gaskets. Just need to rework the chambers now. \n<br>\n<br>The list of jobs grows by the day on the shell, as I work round with the prep and primer. Yet more welding to do!\n<br>\n<br>Had a good couple of days on the Bus this weekend, Saturday I prepped the left side panel, the roof repair and rear corner for etch, degreased keyed and masked up, also etched the inside of the cargo doors.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/fe6b0040aa77bd97458a5809acd4d404_zpsg9og8znn.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/a8fe88fcb0ba83932f45c65ed70d59c8_zpsgigwqtei.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/5759f891c28c640293a28e36f33dd482_zps6menm6qo.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/e28004620a389e997715aa92f0d6867a_zps3xmurw1i.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/ffb37762034a4490ea8b7bd87b1531de_zpskjrxjiwy.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/f15850cc7dca45ff6004bc1ab7bf6298_zpsp6fah557.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/58008ef530a07f9fda59df9d4e1fdc00_zpsiexcp3ie.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Today first thing I seam sealed the side panel, c-pillar and sill. Then carried on with the prep of the engine shelf, had to weld a few screw holes that I missed! \n<br>As I was going to fill the paint gun I flipped the cargo doors over and wiped them down ready for some primer.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/7f17867badbad3f3a0c22c70f5b245d9_zpsi9duacv2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/1497e4d31b86827a81fce3e3e9627c28_zps36knl1px.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/fd989a31b3f4f84b2856c43fb1dc41b1_zps2twpswh2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/937939cfb31ddc810f8be93f418ae751_zpsry8ouqbm.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Whilst that was drying I took the tailgate, engine lid and valence up to work and jet washed the inside to get all the oily residue off. \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/a4bb4510deac06fe7e1d36348dd94a39_zpscjemlf35.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The tailgate needs the seal lip repairing in two places and the engine lid needs some welding at the hinges and behind the number plate light. So best get on with that this week. \n<br>\n<br>Lastly today I made a start cleaning the peak up, it was quite crusty so took it back to bare metal and tarted with some rust converter.\n<br>\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/511254b0af03657ec5f8e85ea2d1c9b7_zpsuqa7yrjn.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w242/JAMESEDD/JAMESEDD002/e491d2a4b0f919f08afc07f8b48403fc_zpslqus8ydo.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Lots to do this week!

As for that motor though, I love it!\n  <br>\n  <br>What comp you aiming for with it as you say you are researching it I expect you arent set yet? With turbo motors I believe 7.5 to 8 is the sweet spot, but depends on boost etc? Will you be using an Intercooler and Water/Methanol or running lower boost to save the hassle?\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>Cheers mate, it does seem to taking forever to get anywhere at this point! There is just so much to do!\n<br>\n<br>Compression ratio is going to be 8.5 :1 to keep It drive-able in the lower rpm range before boost comes in, I will be running a charge cooler from the outset and may add a water injection system at a later date. Only ever run NA air-cooled flat 4's so looking forward to running this one.",
