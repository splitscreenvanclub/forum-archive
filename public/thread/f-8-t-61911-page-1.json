alt=\"Image\">\n  <br> Hello eveyone, i have just worked out after several years how you clever people upload Photos...!!!!\n  <br> i have recently started a 58' panel van that was bought at Vanfest in 06 by a friend, and as we lay underneath it and saying what fantastic condition it was in apart from all the holes everywhere, little did i know but i was going to own it one day.\n  <br> My Friend Kevin who used to be into salvage and straightened out the cab with a hydrolic ram as it was hit as you can see but i watched as the cab came back into shape and the door lined up perfectly....Clever guy that kevin.\n  <br> Keniv then sold it to another friend paul within a week it then sat for 3 years in a Taxi repairers workshop in Hackney London for 3 years covered in Anchor wax until i could take it no longer,made him an offer he couldn't resist and we brought it back to Enfield.\n  <br> \n  <img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/Blue%20Panel%20Van/3.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n  <br> I had just finished my 64' BWA Bus and was hungry for a new project.\n  <br> The Panel had sat in the Navada dessert for a long long time and it seems to have missed out on bad repairs and bodges it looks like i'm the first person to touch the body work,no filler at all....\n  <br> I am not a purist at all and wanted to build another BWA van so i have removed the old gearbox mounts and fitted Creative legs.\n  <br> \n  <img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/Blue%20Panel%20Van/2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n  <br> The problem i had was that pre 59 vans have a round rear rubber mount and the nose cones cant be used so after coresponding with Brian Box i made up a iron support to take a later gear box mount and welding it in between the new creative Irs legs.\n  <br> \n  <img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/Blue%20Panel%20Van/DSC00478.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n  <br> I have removed the cargo floor and was pleasantly suprised.\n  <br> \n  <img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/Blue%20Panel%20Van/60.jpg\" class=\"postimage\"

full of sand and a bag and a half later i was so pleased i met him.unfortuneatley he had to replace all of his outriggers as that was how he found out about the sand...poor guy\n  <br> I have finished the roof off with rust beater and was well please with the result.\n  <br> \n  <img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/Blue%20Panel%20Van/12.jpg\" class=\"postimage\"

in excellent condition if anyone wants it and other parts too...\n<br> \n<br> All the paintwork has now been completed and the rust is now dead...i finished it off with a Matt Lacquer...\n<br> i have painted the underneath with obviously rust buster..4 coats of undercoat and four coats of dove blue.....\n<br> i didn't take pics of the repairs underneath cos i forgot....mainly the central rigger and a couple of outriggers...\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab238/mdcooperuk/new%20stuff/29-04-2010131052.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Just stripped the old beam down and found the spindles are shot and the torsion bars were snapped in half....\n<br> waiting for dropped spindles from Transporterhaus and having the new torsioin bars shortened in my local engineering shop....\n<br> \n<br> hopefully will be fitting the new CSP discs soon and getting her down on her wheels....looking forward to that...!!!",
