That picture is from 1964/5.\n<br> I will look out an earlier one..\n<br> \n<br> My 65 Caravette has a similar male peg on the double seat and a strap and female fitting on the division to keep the 2/3 seat from tipping forwards!\n<br> G\n<br>",

I have not tested the Centre of gravity though..\n<br> \n<br> Something else to play with..\n<br> \n<br> If you think about a cooker just sat on the surface... braking might be interesting with cooker sliding across the top.\n<br> \n<br> &nbsp;I was contemplating making a Y shaped mating part by taking a simple right angled bracket..Like the ones that mount the crockery cupboard to the cargo door.\n<br> \n<br> These have one screw fitting in the short leg and two screw fittings in the long leg. I was thinking about cutting and filing one to leave the hole..\n<br> \n<br> Thanks to a very nice man (wife visited her local hardware supplier) I now have a source of OG perfect brackets...\n<br> \n<br> At least one each side screwed to the surface would keep it in place.\n<br> \n<br> But this would be a bit sharp if you happened to fall on it..\n<br> \n<br> &nbsp;\n<br> &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> I do know an SSVC forum member you managed to stumble and threw his arms about and broke his gas light shade on the rear cupboard!\n<br> \n<br> Alcohol may have been involved..\n<br> \n<br> &nbsp;\n<br> \n<br> I was hoping someone may have an example of this cooker and this fitting.. I was imagining either a loop catch to lock over or a hinge up catch but I have never seen one..\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>",
