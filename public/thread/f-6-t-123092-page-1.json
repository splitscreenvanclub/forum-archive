    "content" : "Essentially VW brought about changes to meet changing requirements and to attempt ro meet/resolve market/ legal requirements and to make improvements.\n<br> They like other makers would introduce a technology in/on one market or model and then introduce it progressively across other models or markets in an attempt to improve or maybe reduce costs by commonisation. The modern ETKA (the VW/Audi/Seat etc. wide parts list) shows model feature part details but also where parts are common. Some air cooled items are listed back to 1949 for engines.\n<br> VW recorded those changes in a model wide log called Progressive Changes.\n<br> Often there are questions attempting to date a vehicle from features and this reference is invaluable in helping to identify. You can access these details electronically on the Obsolete air cooled documentation site.\n<br> More often than not posters want to know what featutes/parts a bus should have to recreate originality.",
