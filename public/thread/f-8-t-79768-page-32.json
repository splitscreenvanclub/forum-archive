But kind of lucky to most restos all running gear was overhauled over these last few years so its just bolt back in.\n<br>Original interior for now which is reaonably tidy but will gradually make new to how we want to modify over next few months so work in progress. Natural light will highlight some snaggy defects or paint imperfections which worse case scenario may need some body work but have plenty of paint so no issue.",
