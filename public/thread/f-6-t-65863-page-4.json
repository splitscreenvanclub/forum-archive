During the process I wire brushed as much surface rust as I could get too, the welder who did the worked commented on the condition of the chassis, said it was one of the best he'd seen. \n<br> Its been sat for a while, most of it coated in zinc primer. Still got to remove some surface rust from the rear of the bus, then need to finish it off with something. \n<br> \n<br> Searched the many threads on here and the two most common solutions would appear to be POR 15 and epoxy mastic 121\n<br> \n<br> POR 15 is best used on bare metal so not an option\n<br> \n<br> Epoxy was what I was going to use, will it be OK over the zinc primer?\n<br> \n<br> Will a top coat be needed over it?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Tony",

    "content" : "I don’t usually resurrect threads but for once I thought it may be helpful. I’m just changing my gearbox to an original small nut box (large nut possibly for sale once completed) so whilst I’m at it I thought I would just share a couple of quick pictures. If you look back through this thread you will see the work I did 9 years ago in stripping and painting my bus with por15. I have to admit we only use the bus for holidays and days out so not as a daily driver but so far I’m very pleased with how it has held up and thought I’d share these. Apologies as I haven’t cleaned under the wheel well otherwise it would look a lot better. I thought others who may be deciding what to do may find this helpful. Yes it took a lot of work at the time but I haven’t touched it in 9 years as it has kept going strong. Hence, in the long run I think the time to prep and preserve was well worth it. Anyway, enough rambling her are a couple of pictures. \n<br> \n<br> Steve\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33149&amp;sid=2c13ff8f2cf98ac2b81e73bf0d841635&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33149&amp;t=1&amp;sid=2c13ff8f2cf98ac2b81e73bf0d841635\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"1F84DAC7-77E4-4666-9407-B94ADE6B0D1D.jpeg\" title=\"1F84DAC7-77E4-4666-9407-B94ADE6B0D1D.jpeg (202.18 KiB) Viewed 571 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33148&amp;sid=2c13ff8f2cf98ac2b81e73bf0d841635&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33148&amp;t=1&amp;sid=2c13ff8f2cf98ac2b81e73bf0d841635\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"7F0E8143-FA0C-41AF-A65D-5B049C64DD79.jpeg\" title=\"7F0E8143-FA0C-41AF-A65D-5B049C64DD79.jpeg (209.33 KiB) Viewed 571 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
