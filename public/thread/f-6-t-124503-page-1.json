    "content" : "Could anyone offer any advice on a problem I have please?\n<br> \n<br> I’ve recently purchased a new bus and prior to collection the previous owner fitted a new indicator stalk and relay as the high beam was temperamental. On the drive home the indicators stopped working and spring to life again an hour or so later. \n<br> \n<br> Over the next few weeks the flash rate would vary between very slow/normal before now completely giving up. \n<br> \n<br> The symptoms: it’s a 1967 with high beam/flash on the stalk.\n<br> \n<br> The indicators come on but are solid. No flashing and no light on the speedo either. \n<br> \n<br> I’ve checked the bulb on the speedo, all the indicator bulbs all round and cleaned all the connections.\n<br> \n<br> The high beam still works so could the relay be faulty for just the flasher unit? As far as I can see there no missing wires. I’ve checked the fuses and all seem ok. I’ve traced and cleaned the earths that I can find and it all seems ok? \n<br> \n<br> I’m stumped \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",
