I'm really looking forward to using the bus this year and taking the kids away camping and day trips in the bus!!! \n<br> \n<br> You are absolutely right about them not thinking its so cool in years to come, that's why I'm gonna try and get in early and spend as much time as I can with them now. \n<br> \n<br> Don't worry, by the time they go to uni - they will realise just how cool spilts (and thus dad actually is)!!\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">BO JANGLES</strong>\n<br> \n<br> Cheers mate, your bus is one of my inspirations for keep trying to improve mine.

I will definately try to make it next year - if you are crazy enough to do another!!! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> \n<br> Are you doing any other shows??

Yours really is gonna be one of the best samba's out there mate!!! \n<br> \n<br> I am still over the moon with my interior. Daron has done a really class job, and it was well worth the extra expense (IMHO).\n<br> I also really like what they did with your speakers in the seat and was going to talk to them about something similar in my bus (if that is ok with you??).\n<br> \n<br> As for the turbo, that fits the 'useable' part of the scentence - (but missed out 'useable at warp speed') \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> As for reliable, don't tell the missus!!!!

    "content" : "Hi all, \n<br> \n<br> Well sorry it has been a long while since I have posted up any updates. \n<br> \n<br> Here goes, there has been a lot to comment on.... both good and bad!!!\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong class=\"text-strong\">The GOOD</strong></span>\n<br> \n<br> Whilst Jim was working on the engine, I got him to do a couple of other bits and bobs... \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Firstly, I got him to install the propex that I bought over 2 years ago, which had been sitting in my garage collecting dust. I didn't want the plastic air vents supplied with the kit to be cut into the repro devon interior, so Jim came up with a clever solution of having a reducer made to plumb it into the stock heater tube. \n<br> \n<br> It has a quick release fitting so that it can be quickly disconnected and the gas bottle used for the cooker.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/propex.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Also, I bought a repro westfalia hammock off a guy on here (details to follow, but available in the for sale section) and had it installed. Really happy with it and helps solve the sleeping issue until I can afford an eriba familia.\n<br> \n<br> The canvas is currently green, but will be getting it made up in brown as soon as I can to suit the bus a bit better. \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/hammock.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> My son absolutely loves sleeping on it!!!\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Pics of the install of the engine. \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/engineinstall2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> And with it finished\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/engineinstall.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Had to have a custom exhaust fabricated as all the off the shelf ones had clearance issues with the turbo header, or were too loud, etc, etc, etc.... \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/exhaust.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sadly they tacked on a boy racer exhaust tip, which will be coming off as soon as I can afford to do so!! \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/exhaust2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong class=\"text-strong\">The BAD</strong></span>\n<br> \n<br> The engine has been fitted with a CB quicktune EFI turbo system fitted to it, but sadly it has been a bit of an ongoing nightmare!!! \n<br> \n<br> It has developed an intermittent fault, so one minute it drives perfectly, the next it drives like a pile of S**T. \n<br> \n<br> This only presented a week or so before Jim went off on his travels which he didn't have time to sort out before he left....\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> The culprit \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_evil.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":evil:\" title=\"Evil\"> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/ecu.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Consequently, I could not risk taking the missus and the kids in a bus that didn't work properly. I had to go to volksworld in the daily, which was just not the same!!!\n<br> \n<br> I have since booked it in with Matt Keane, to try and sort it out, so that I don't miss the whole of the summer....\n<br> \n<br> More to follow........\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> flip \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\">",
