    "content" : "Having just had an SSVC valuation on my rare RHD Westy SO34 (I only know of 1 other RHD with all original interior present), which has somewhat shocked me I am testing the water as to what I could get for, as one member said 'Flipseat Heaven!' \n<br>\n<br>As I don't have a garage it is impossible to get it insured for its value!! Its locked away now and not getting the use it deserves.\n<br>\n<br>I am looking at a potential cash + your van (or straight cash) deal.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">The March 1961, SO34 has:</span>\n<br>\n<br>Right Hand Drive !!!\n<br>Original interior including table\n<br>Mostly original upholstery\n<br>Original Tent poles\n<br>\n<br>BBT repro canopy canvas\n<br>Repro Safaris (originals were too far gone, but all original window furniture retained)\n<br>6 pop outs with original spoons\n<br>Obviously all new rubberwear!\n<br>Original cab mat.\n<br>Rebuilt gearbox.\n<br>New internally coated petrol tank and resistant fuel lines.\n<br>New brake cylinders, and added servo assisted dual circuit master cylinder for safety, new brake lines where required)\n<br>Rebuilt reduction gears\n<br>New tyres (approx 1000 miles on them)\n<br>Strong 1500 engine that came with bus but not original (although I do have all the parts to build a 1200 stale air on a Feb 61 rebuilt short block..this would be available separately, but could be included at the asking price)\n<br>\n<br>Bus was imported from Zimbabwe, via South Africa and returned to its original colour. The only metal that had to be replaced was near side sill and a small hole ( 50p sized) on cab floor patch.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is little known on the circuit (had its first 'official outing' at Lavenham this year)\n<br>\n<br>Looking for \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Â£56000</span> , but happy to take a solid bus in part exchange preferably small window, preferably walkthrough, or Sundial, Riviera etc Not too bothered about paintwork but definitely nothing requiring metalwork. \n<br>\n<br>Its a damn lot of cash I know, it surprised me too, but as I was told 'Where are you going to find another, when its as rare as this!! \n<br>\n<br>As the Yanks say 'no lowballers please' I can always keep it locked up for a few more years as an investment, but it should be used and enjoyed.\n<br>\n<br>More photos emailed on request.\n<br>\n<br>Cheers,\n<br>\n<br>Ed\n<br>\n<br>\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\">\n <!-- ia0 -->IMG_0393.jpg\n <!-- ia0 -->\n</div>\n<br>\n<br>'",
