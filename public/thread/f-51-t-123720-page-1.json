    "content" : "FOR SALE is my very solid and straight 13 window deluxe,\n<br> I bought this from Ben Jones (Race Shack) 9years ago, and have added lots of goodies since then.\n<br> The cab has a full roll-cage, it is a Bus with Attitude having run 15.25secs up the strip when owned by Ben.\n<br> The front suspension is Red 9 Design with discs and coil over shocks and rack and pinion steering. There is also a disc lock fitted but not wired in. The rear suspension is IRS with Porsche 944 discs.\n<br> The motor is a very reliable 2110cc with twin Weber 44carbs, so the bus goes and stops well.\n<br> The cluth is a Kennedy stage2.\n<br> I will give you full spec of engine if you phone me.\n<br> \n<br> At the same time all this was being done a new wiring loom was also fitted, (there is provision for a leisure battery)\n<br> The wheels are 15inch BRM's\n<br> \n<br> The interior has porsche leather(blue) up front with a Gene Berg shifter and Moto-lita steering wheel. The rear has carpet and a rock and roll bed. All the interior panels are a very light ply and covered in stickers, but could be covered properly if that is your choice.\n<br> There is no stereo, just the music from the motor.\n<br> \n<br> So to round up, this is a ratty looking but very solid van , with excellent mechanics.\n<br> I am only selling due to my age.\n<br> If you want pictures message me your email address or phone me on ...07886 036 860... for a chat.\n<br> \n<br> I don't want this bus to hang around so i am asking what i believe to be a very fair price of ...Â£20, 000 firm. Thanks for reading , phone me for further details.\n<br> Thank you , \n<br> Phill.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> ,",
