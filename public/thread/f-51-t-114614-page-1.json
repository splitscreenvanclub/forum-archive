But I've changed direction now and she needs a new home. \n<br> So this is an all original swr seamed gate truck with a complete original interior, perfect original seats that have been re stuffed but lovely aged vinyl... Original early pop out catches, original gates in good condition, buswares canopy, original hoops, original wood bed slats, nice set of split bus wheels... It's all there (except motor) \n<br> The panels I've collected to start the resto are as follows.. \n<br> Autocraft rear corners \n<br> Autocraft side panels and rear wheel arch panels \n<br> Ww front arches \n<br> Gerson rear floors \n<br> Gerson b pillars \n<br> Gerson c pillars \n<br> Battery and platform trays \n<br> Inner sills and outriggers \n<br> Pretty much everything to get the bus together... \n<br> \n<br> For an extra £995 I will include a complete set of 58/59 original safaris \n<br> \n<br> Will help with shipping anywhere In the world \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> This truck is a fantastic start for a high end build, very rare early truck in what I think is the best colour going.. \n<br> Matt \n<br> 07791 596199",
