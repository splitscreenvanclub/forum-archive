Maybe a cover for a beetle/ ghia exhaust as its thicker than most tin wear\n<br>\n<br>Round thing, curious to know what this is, maybe a cover of some sort.\n<br>\n<br>Any way if your interested you can have it just call it £4 postage for bat cover and £2 for the other parts.\n<br>\n<br>Jason\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/10/30/37d932d156a86077d3de0d63b47320d0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my HUAWEI G6-L11 using Tapatalk",
