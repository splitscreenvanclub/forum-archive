There's metal to weld it to and it will be hidden by the bumper so I think I'll just go with it.

Either this bad repair has pulled it in, or it has been replaced badly because it is being lined up with the wonky B-post. This is the post from the inside. Clearly some rot, but it doesn't look like a bad repair or any kind of repair has been done on it, which may explain why it is so out:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1057.photobucket.com/user/paul_t_d/media/Normal/PIC_0204_zps3039fc51.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1057.photobucket.com/albums/t383/paul_t_d/Normal/PIC_0204_zps3039fc51.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1057.photobucket.com/user/paul_t_d/media/Normal/PIC_0205_zps5a693613.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1057.photobucket.com/albums/t383/paul_t_d/Normal/PIC_0205_zps5a693613.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> It doesn't look like it's had a knock from the outside. My current theory is that someone has tried to jack it on that jacking point and the crap metal has given way abd bent it in. It's hard to see in those pics but the B-post is a little twisted. More worryingly, that rare walkthrough panel is a bit bent at the bottom.",
