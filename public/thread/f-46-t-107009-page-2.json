PATINA.\n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji3.png\"> \n<br> \n<br> I know that the shroud from a fixed unit for the swing out cooker does not need to be sloped in at the back and a recent comment made of a later Bay WT swing out cooker shield clashing with the side windows when attempting to use it in a rear cooker cupboard unit at the side of a 65 split samba bus..\n<br> \n<br> Cooker had to be moved forward and then the knobs clashed with the drop down lid.\n<br> \n<br> So shroud had to be modified to suit.\n<br> \n<br> Not physically seen yet.\n<br> \n<br> So need to be very clear that the design and sizes are correct for the missing item before you start a production line Jim!",
