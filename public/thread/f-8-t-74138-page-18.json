    "content" : "Yes... I was quite surprised that I looked at my original flooring board which is very simple 3 ply and have used this as a \"template to line things up. I did put an acoustic insulator layer under the board which is a simple closed cell foam with a silver reflective water proof layer. This 4 mm ply board is rivetted down on a 9\" grid which with weight above it maybe gives a degree of compression and sn 1.5mm depth increase.\n<br>Others have measured their floor board at 5cm. ...But. .\n<br>\n<br>Madmatz recommend 9 mm. They sell an edge strip to suit that. I reused the division alloy strip just like Devon.\n<br>The run from front to back of bus works out to complete tiles....\n<br>So looks good.\n<br>I have tiled solid floors many many years ago with the larger 12\" tiles back in the 80.s... But I do prefer the look of the charcoal n ice in 9\"..\n<br>Fitted really well and hopefully will last another 50 years. .",

Do these things ever get finished...?\n<br>\n<br>I fitted all the restored Devon interior furniture....using exact copies of the original rusty screws. They are all findable in Stainless.\n<br>I have kept all the original screws and will post a very sad thread of what screw goes where!\n<br>I unwrapped all the lovely cushions which Joanne (dollydaydream) had lovingly made for me \n<br>Thanks J&amp;S Trimshak....\n<br>I had the cushion seat covers made in duracouresque Ross Stria Jade material which matches the Velvet Green lower colour.\n<br>\n<br>I hung the curtains which my DIL had made.\n<br>She was very disappointe with them.\n<br>Original Devon curtains were made with curtain tape with very small loops at the top of the tape. The curtain tape fitted right at the top of thecurtain so that the curtain sits level with rail and sits under the start of the curve of roof.\n<br>She bought some lovely material New Patch Olive Butter \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.vwcampercurtains.co.uk/check.htm\">http://www.vwcampercurtains.co.uk/check.htm</a>\n<!-- m --> and made the curtains beautifully...and a cutlery holder.\n<br>She used swish curtain tape and swish curtian hooks and was disappointed rhat they hung away and beleow the rail...\n<br>But the lesson is you jave to use silent gliss curtain hooks..these work excellently..\n<br>\n<br>I have fitted the front seats covered for me by Bromsgrove Trimmers.\n<br>\n<br>One of the most stressful things was to take my original VW front Mat and cut it to fit around and under my WASU change speed lever lock...but this worked well!\n<br>\n<br>But I did not take many photographs of the stages because they are all minor details..\n<br>\n<br>I will yake pictures of them and post in the thread..\n<br>\n<br>When I looked at the detailing. the list of things I still needed to do..came to two pages!\n<br>\n<br>So a taster.....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/user/type21f/media/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150315_113551_zpsotflpgmx.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/20150315_113551_zpsotflpgmx.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>off to make breakfast...
