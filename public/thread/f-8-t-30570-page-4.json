    "content" : "More progress to report, we're on welding week 9 (if i haven't lost count, along with my mind and my bank balance) and we're nearly finished! Just a bit more wire-brushing &amp; painting to do underneath to start off with... funny how Dave left me to do the wire-brushing eh... \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3104/2833855933_453de42657.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>But managed to make it good... \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3294/2833856383_bffc32d768.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2834694742_313a0c5615.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>Meanwhile the major progress has been the doglegs and the front floor... this has been one of those jobs thats dragged on and on because we've been waiting on parts. The original plan was to rip the whole doglegs off and replace with the Gerson panels... these turned out very difficult to get and were a very expensive option ($800 - $1000 for the pair, delivered \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/shock.gif\" alt=\":shock:\" title=\"Shock\"> ). The Brazilian .... ones were not an option - Daves (and Pashs's) experience with them was so bad he refused to work with them and I agreed. \n<br> \n<br>I ended up buying just this panel pair from Autokraft (via Classic Veedub) + the floor panels: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.autocrafteng.co.uk/images/products/prod_Oz%20parts%203%20015.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://www.autocrafteng.co.uk/images/products/prod_Nuts%20001.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>The rest (almost the whole dogleg) was fabricated and repaired by Dave by hand... \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2833857027_3663fcb580.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2834694164_11bb869939.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>view from the inside: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2833856641_c930aea8c9.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>and the front floor: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3095/2833856851_16f034a8cf.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>As a comparison, here's an old pic of what it looked like before. Its difficult to make out but basically the inside dogleg was made up of crap tin panels held in place with gallons of silicon sealant, Yeuch! \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3056/2834784648_61a51b549d.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>Pretty impressive improvement, i think you'll agree.... Amazingly enough, this kind of almost wraps up the welding work for Dave, just a few little odd jobs here and there: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3274/2834693706_810f3b6e3f.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>... and I'm turning my thoughts away from the major mechancal work which I've done and onto a few details, like a speedo tidy-up, and those shiny \n<span style=\"font-style: italic\">shiny</span> wheels, yay! \n<br> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2833855823_09f9b7ef78.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/2833855483_15071a0830.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>So, very soon we're off to the panel shop for some pulling, pushing, pug, paint and polish... I have mixed feelings about this because up until now the work has been very much under \n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">our</span> control... from here on in we'll be at the mercy of a paint shop (notoriously unreliable in my experience), so who knows if we'll be 2 months \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> 6 months \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> or 24 months \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif\" alt=\":cry:\" title=\"Cry\"> away from cruising around again.
