    "content" : "First off, what year and RHD or LHD (if it makes a difference) are these off? The clutch pedal has a smaller mounting diameter than the one that fitted the bus, and the other pedal doesn't have the clamping arrangement to match the one off the bus.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.fotopic.net/1ywdb2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Next, what's going on with the steering column top mount? It doesn't clamp up the column, and as you can see from the photo, the bracket looks way too big. Is this off the wrong year BD too?\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.fotopic.net/1ywdb1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Finally, what do the panel work fixings look like? I've just been using tinware screws for the moment to get things positioned to keep the project moving.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://images.fotopic.net/1ywdas.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>thanks",
