I'm currently running a Swing Axle bug setup with long axles and CSP 5x205 drums (the ones which use the later wide brake shoes). I'm wanting to move to IRS and to initially stick with the same brakes but upgrade to the Porsche 944 disk brakes and 5x130 pattern later.\n<br>\n<br>I'm going to use Beetle IRS control arms and am trying to figure out whether there will be an increase in track if I stick with my existing CSP drums.",
