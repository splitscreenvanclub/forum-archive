I told him I'd bought another Vespa.\n<br>\n<br>When we got to the place in Luton where we were collecting he got a surprise. I didn't take a photo at the time but did once we got home. There were a few white lies told along the way, but after calling me a few names I think I've been forgiven \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Tiger%20Cub/IMAG0604_zpslskyxp7g.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Tiger%20Cub/IMAG0604_zpslskyxp7g.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>A Triumph Tiger Cub T20. He had one as a lad, and has been wanting one to restore for a while now.

Then gave it a light coat of etch primer and got the heater on it. Sorry forgot to photograph \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> \n<br>\n<br>Whilst that was drying I turned my attention to one of the cab doors. \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG0609_zpscvksfsj9.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG0609_zpscvksfsj9.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I've tried to fill the holes with weld, but doing the \"torch test\" from behind keeps revealing more pin holes. I don't think the door is bad enough to warrant buying a new lower skin and frame repair but that's always my fallback position.\n<br>\n<br>I cut out the thinning areas and will replace with some new metal. I've already made a repair patch up for the underside but the problem was always going to be welding to the bit that goes in the seam. I decided to have a little play…. I made up and shaped a bit to the profile of the door \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG0611_zpsxu7kxlej.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG0611_zpsxu7kxlej.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>it goes here\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG0612_zpsh1lrfvei.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG0612_zpsh1lrfvei.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>tacked into place\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s790.photobucket.com/user/stevejones3163/media/Rusty/IMAG0613_zpstxqfgamk.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i790.photobucket.com/albums/yy185/stevejones3163/Rusty/IMAG0613_zpstxqfgamk.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>and after that I welded it in and shaped it to fit my repair panel, but enough of that, the paint was now dry \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> so good key with some 80 grit ( and I know the pro's are probably pi55ing themselves laughing at my efforts, but I really am making it up as I go \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> ) and then I smeared some Fantastic filler on.

This has got to be one of the biggest design faults on the bus. You drop your coffee, or put a wet wheel in there after changing to the spare, and any liquid runs down the back and you can't get it out and then it starts to rust \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> I'm thinking about seam sealing it all up to prevent this.

I have 6 catches, all in varying states of repair, but I think I could get four working catches from the 6, albeit not in pristine condition, but i can work on that.\n<br>\n<br>My theory is that the back most pair, one each side have the captivated nut plates, then a triangle piece goes on ( the unthreaded, clearanced type) then the catch screws to that with 4mm machine screws.\n<br>\n<br>The others, the two on the cargo doors and the front two on the driver's side, have the triangles (the threaded type) spot welded to the doors or the sides of the bus and there is no adjustment. The catches then go onto these.\n<br>\n<br>I have seen posts about \"long spoon\" catches. What are these, what's the idea and which pop outs do they fit on?\n<br>\n<br>Sorry for all the questions, but if you think this is bad, wait til I get to the engine \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers\n<br>\n<br>Steve",

    "content" : "Hi mate,\n<br>\n<br>Personally I would seam seal the bottom of the area you mentioned. When I cut mine out there was all sorts in there and it would be a mare to get to if you did spill anything. At least if its all seam sealed what does end up there will evaporate over time and the seams wont be affected. \n<br>\n<br>As for the pitting how deep is the remainder do you think? High build would probably be your best option but if its deep I would refill first then high build afterwards, but I'm far from good at bodywork so thats a gut instinct rather than professional opinion!! \n<br>\n<br>Long spoon latches have a longer arm so they open further and look pretty in the process, other than that they do the same job. As for the plates I don't have a clue why some adjust and others don't, mine are the same as yours except they have been modded so they all open backwards so I had to buy the spacer plates as on the cargo door and work with what I had! Its a minefield isnt it!!\n<br>\n<br>Looking forward to the engine part! Its great fun compared to bodywork honest!!!",
