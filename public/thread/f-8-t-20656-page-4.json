So despite no updates in a long time. \n<br>I have been tipping away at the bus. \n<br>Work on the bus has to take somewhat of a back seat\n<br>The following took up some time. \n<br>\n<br>Getting Married, \n<br>Made redundant. \n<br>Baby no. 1 born. \n<br>Started new job. \n<br>Sold house. \n<br>Bought new House. \n<br>Moved house. \n<br>Renovated house. \n<br>Baby no. 2 on the way. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Even though my bus is tucked up in my own garage.

And then figure out where I left off the last time I was lying under this 50 year old virgin.. \n<br>\n<br>Some things like mounting hydraulic clutch and line and adjusting the cable gear change took me days of an hour here, a half hour there. \n<br>But finally I managed to Test drive the tdi in back of Splitty. \n<br>\n<br>Albeit without accelerator pedal. \n<br>Ran on idle. And it's ticking over very high. \n<br>I'll get to that in due course. \n<br>Might be due to MAF disconnected. Dunno.
