    "content" : "Hi, would really appreciate some advice.\n<br> \n<br> Went for a drive this morning, all fine, then after having been parked up for about 5 minutes, went to re-start, nothing. All the lights were on, fuel pump was on, but no crank. Battery was fully charged.\n<br> \n<br> RAC man came, scratched his head, couldn't get it to work, so, we did a bump start. \n<br> \n<br> I've got the van home now and since then, tried starting again, and it's back working perfectly.\n<br> \n<br> Any ideas, is this just a random one off, or something more sinister? Should I be considering a new starter motor?\n<br> \n<br> Engine is a twin carb 1776 with Electronic ignition.",
