    "content" : "If anyone is looking for a way to play their music through their existing 6v radio then this may be of interest. I had it fitted to my 6v beetle for a few months but that has been sold now so I don’t have a particular use for it anymore. I’m sure I’ve seen lots of clever ways to this but I have to say this was a very simple setup as I’m not electrical or radio minded and it needed no modifications. Official website to tell you how it works is \n<a href=\"http://www.rediraduk.com\" class=\"postlink\">http://www.rediraduk.com</a>\n<br> \n<br> It is in almost new condition as it was only on the beetle very briefly. Sound was pretty good for the original speaker and I’m sure with a better quality speaker it would have worked better also. Selling for £60 plus £5 postage or you are free to collect. \n<br> \n<br> Drop me a PM if interested. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",
