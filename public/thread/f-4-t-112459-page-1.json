    "content" : "Here for sale is a flat 4, 2L engine with twin carbs for sale.\n<br>\n<br>This was originally bought by my dad to upgrade the engine that came with my bus however due to not having the funds to get a new gearbox and new set up at the back I decided against it. It was originally purchased for £500.\n<br>\n<br>I'm looking for £350 ono. This includes tinware and the engine would need to be collected, currently based in SG11 2QA.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1118.photobucket.com/user/MattD000/media/Selling/IMG_0085.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Selling/IMG_0085.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1118.photobucket.com/user/MattD000/media/Selling/IMG_5112.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1118.photobucket.com/albums/k603/MattD000/Selling/IMG_5112.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
