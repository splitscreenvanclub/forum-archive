When fixing the plates the the cargo floor with the undulations in it, do you profile the plate to match or just weld to the highs and seam seal the lows??",

I knew you needed feet but wasn't sure why some are boxed and others flat. When I was using the box section I was going to use flat 3mm thick 75x75 plates as load spreaders but then decided to go for CDS and for some reason changed to boxes but didn't know why Id made the decision, hence the question. \n<br>\n<br>The seam sealer was just to stop the gunk getting underneath and rotting the floor through below, I wouldn't cover the welds at all, but good point about them not been able to \"see\" the welds as that could cause problems, didn't think of that. I wont be racing the bus but its nice to build the cage to a 'spec' as you said so I might as well conform! \n<br>\n<br>Cheers for the help again.",
