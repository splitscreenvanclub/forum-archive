Only problem is I think I kept the better quality and therefore more expensive one. I’ll have a look in the morning to check I still have it and which one it is if that helps. I’m just outside Lincoln near to Scampton. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",

Appears to have a zip that allows you into the door of the van when on but I can’t remember exactly what it looks like to be honest. Was your intention to buy or borrow? \n<br> \n<br> If no use I won’t be offended as it’s made me get it out of the loft and think about selling it given I’ve not used it for so long. If wanting to buy then I’m open to sensible offers as I’ve not looked at how much they are as yet. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",

Also if you aren’t in a rush for it then I may be able to meet you part way on a run out next weekend if the weather isn’t bad at say Downtown Grantham. \n<br> \n<br> Steve",
