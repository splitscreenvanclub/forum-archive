Eddy has insisted these will be free to a good home. There will be a supply on the SSVC stand, but once they are gone, they're gone...\n<br> If you need me to keep you a copy then please put your name down on here or pm me.\n<br> \n<br> For those of you not going to Busfest but still want a copy, the magazine would be free but I would have to ask for p+p which would be £1.70. (only because it's club funds..)",
