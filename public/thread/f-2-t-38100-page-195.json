    "content" : "The whole package was built by CPR....Chico Racing Performance in the States. He had the header made and it's certainly the first he's done or knows of. It's running a pair of Turbo prep'd Dells the I built and supplied, and a locked out dizzy. The brief was to keep it old school ie simple \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> No efi or fancy ignition system.....and must have heat \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> Final position for the intake is undecided. Currently in a California position \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> but no good for the UK really....cos I use my buses come rain or shine. One option is to stick the filter straight onto the turbo but not ideal for cool air. I am going to look at the option of running it past the G/box and maybe making a box to take a big panel filter. If not it'll be the more popular idea of having it come up into the engine bay. It'll mean notching the rear tin and rear valance but it keeps the filter out of the weather.....In the pic you can see the exhaust pipe isn't fitted. This was taken before it went on the dyno. Made over 200bhp at 8psi boost and over 240 on 12psi.\n<br>It actually arrived in the UK yesterday and is being delivered tomorrow \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",
