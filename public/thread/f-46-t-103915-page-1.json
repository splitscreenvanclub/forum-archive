    "content" : "Ok so my 62 is getting the Devon treatment. Not being able to find a good non restored uk van I opted for an Australian 11 window, it's a bit rough but I like it. Anyways trying to find a complete interior for a pre 63/64 has been hard but I've found various parts. I have a rear drawer frame in need of a good bit of repair but it's missing the drawers. I've looked and looked but not found any, can someone please find me a pair or show me some pictures so I can recreate some.\n<br>Many thanks.",

Search my posts in this section I have mentioned them before. \n<br>\n<br>If you have a narrow hatch then take them apart and cut them down - they're the correct sloping front ones for your yearo. \n<br>\n<br>62/3 has longer rear drawers as they go all the way to the seat back - earlier have lockers in the rear seat back and later have table leg storage behind the seat. \n<br>\n<br>Mine are being borrowed for copying so I can't do you measurements I'm afraid.",

Some have brass finger pulls, some I've just seen with finger holes although not sure if that's correct.",
