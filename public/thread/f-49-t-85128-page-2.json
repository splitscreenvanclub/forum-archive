Better off there as its connected to the starter battery and protects the whole length of it. There are grommets where it passes through the sheet metalwork but you can't be too carefull\n<br>There's also a little fusebox I've installed for the leisure circuits. My fridge has a fuse on it but I've still run it's socket off the fusebox and I have spare connections for anything I want to add. \n<br>Takes some working out.",
