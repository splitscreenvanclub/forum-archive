    "content" : "Well I acquired this a few months back and decided it's time I got some pictures up before I lose them , it's a 1960 panel which appears to have been laid up in Alabama since 1974 going by the magazines and newspapers I found in the back. Plan is to repair rust, age as well as I can and run it stock. Initial plan was to ship it off for the welding but I quickly realised that would bankrupt me as I am also doing a lot of work on the house at the same time. Couple of pics for now . \n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/12/10/faa0a8727355c8fadaea402e46494e71.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/12/10/2bbbcdb06a04610f7b183163dff06135.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/12/10/6688b82f1db330de5b4dcc36a9ec2f09.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://images.tapatalk-cdn.com/15/12/10/3c05f7e1f6fa5f29c55d907261dafb70.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
