Ive thought about fabricating my own, but apart from the fact ita CDS, Im not sure on OD and wall thicknesses etc, and those bloomin tube benders are not cheap so thought Id get some input from you knowlegeable chaps first!\n<br>\n<br>Any help, phots or advice would be very much appreciated as its a minefield!",

There are different regs for different types of racing. \n<br>\n<br>Options for tube are CDS and cro moly, Iirc the same diameter tube but cro mo is stronger than CDS so the specs allow a thinner tube wall compared to CDS making it lighter but 'as' strong as CDS. \n<br>Cro mo costs more in raw materials. \n<br>\n<br>Any good race car or Motorsport garage should be able to fit a cage in anything so you could also look outside of the VW community for companies also. \n<br>\n<br>I'm not sure you can get made to fit cages for buses as each cage is basically bespoke and not all buses are true and straight so it might look odd. \n<br>\n<br>I pick my bus up Wednesday so if I remember I'll throw some photos up.",

Missed all of these replies, think my notifications are screwed as I never get updates to threads I've subscribed to anymore...\n<br>\n<br>Anyway, thanks for the pictures guys, mine wont be used for racing, just to keep the family safer than they usually would be in the bus. Ive decided to build my own cage, and have ordered the tube bending equipment (not cheap!!).
