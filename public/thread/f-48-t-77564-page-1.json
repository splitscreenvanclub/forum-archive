    "content" : "Aloha dude!\n<br>depending on where you are probably dictates where is best. I got mine from a foam shop in Pentonville Road and he did enough to do all the cushions for £100 and then £10 for the stockinette to put under the cushion fabric. If you dont use stockinette the material tends to catch on the foam and twist it all around and eventuially it takes chunks out of the foam. They also cut it to size for me as well. Dont be fooled into thinking you can cut in yourself as you'll end up with it looking like Freddie Kruger did it when he was drunk \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> . I just told the bloke what it was for and he said what was best. When sitting on it its quite soft but as he rightly ppointed out, if you go any harder it will be like lying on a solid block when used as a bed as you're putting less pressure on it due to the spreading of the (love) load. Generally people use medium density, this from the direct foam.com website \"Medium – this is the recommended density for seating cushions that are 4” in depth or more, it provides comfort and offers good support\" and from memory i think thats what i got and its perfect. \n<br>I did mine as follows...\n<br>Rear facing bench seat - one piece for the seat base and one piece for the back rest\n<br>Forward facing bench seat - section covering the sink and the backrest section above the sink, rest of backrest one section, rest of seat base 2 sections. \n<br>I did it like this as it makes it easier to slot it all in and move it around when making up the bed etc but i can still get to the storage fairly easily which for me is mainly under the forward facing bench seat hence doing that bit in 2 sections. plus its also less sewing for Mrs. Empi \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>\n<br>hope that helps, \n<br>cheers, Lee",
