    "content" : "My friend has a early bay that has been off the road now for over 10 years parked up on a friends drive. The van I suppose is only worth about 3 to 4 grand. However it does have a number plate VWV 1OOK, which for anyone one with a VW Van and wants people to look at it, well it couldnt be better. We really dont know where to start to value this plate. I am quite tempted myself as I will be getting my project coming over from South Africa in a few months.\n<br>Does anyone know where we can find the true value of such a plate ?",

If so if it can be transferred it can't go on anything older than a 1971 vehicle but as you say would LOOK great on a bay.",

    "content" : "Hello, the true value will be where the buyer sees it and where you think is a good pitch point. \n<br>\n<br>I have GDF 45T (GO FAST) and to the right buyer on the right day it could run into the few thousands and above. On another day it could be £1500. On another day it could be £500! You get the pictures with plates like these.\n<br>\n<br>Do some research, ebay is a good start point, to see the varieties of plate and what people are asking for them (what they ask and what they get however...........!)\n<br>\n<br>I wouldn't even bother going to places like regtransfers as I can tell you now they'll say circa £500 but they do allow you to give them a price you want and they will market it - their fees are horrendous though! I could be wrong though and it's only IMHO.\n<br>\n<br>That plate is only going to be of interest to a VW owner obviously but it's a quirky plate for sure and I think, like above, it's probably VWV 100K as your suggestion of the format is not possible. \n<br>\n<br>To the right person it's a lovely asset and talking point to the vehicle at a show and out and about.\n<br>\n<br>Bear in mind that it cannot go on an older vehicle that a K plate. So you're looking at 1972 for a K and my guess is that would exclude your import if you're going for a bus? I think those are still the rules but someone may say otherwise??\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps even just a little.",
