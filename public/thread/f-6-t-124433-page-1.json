I was mildly irritated and used about five minutes of seriously vile language! Anyway:\n<br> \n<br> 1 Do I leave the thing in the tank until I begin to see black bits in the filters or\n<br> 2 Do I try to fish it out? Anyone have any great ideas about how I might do this?\n<br> 3 Pull the engine that I have just installed and take the tank out?\n<br> \n<br> Anyone know if I can safely stick a camera in the tank? \n<br> \n<br> Surely I can't be the only one in the world to have done this - or can I claim my prize now?\n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> Brian",

    "content" : "Well I tried the endoscope which gave me a nice view of the bottom of the tank but couldn't see the fuel can nozzle which had migrated to the spout end of the tank - the invisible end. I did see some weird dark shapes on the tank bottom though. So bit the bullet this morning and pulled the engine and tank. Took out the sender and could see the horrible nozzle lurking in a dark corner so fished it out with a wire hook. \n<br> \n<br> The weird dark shapes at the bottom were blobs of half dissolved self-amalgamating tape that held the nozzle to the can. Washed them out with brake cleaner then pulled the in-tank filter which was almost blocked with more goo. Cleaned it with brake cleaner. Had awesome takeaway roast lunch from our pub - yum. Put tank and engine back in (solo effort pulling it but needed help from the management to steady it when it went back!). Filtered fuel back in and the old bus runs again! Here is a pic of the nozzle just before I burnt it with a demonic grin as it went up in a puff of black smoke! \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=38530&amp;sid=bda96cd8d4b6146bbfc19371a3ae9a92&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=38530&amp;t=1&amp;sid=bda96cd8d4b6146bbfc19371a3ae9a92\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"IMG_20200329_175427981[1].jpg\" title=\"IMG_20200329_175427981[1].jpg (96.46 KiB) Viewed 1496 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
