If you're going for big power then you'll need a Porsche 915 gearbox anyway.\n<br> \n<br> I doubt you'd want to carry over much of the Scooby apart from the engine. You may want the ECU but that could be more hassle than its worth. It would be easier to buy an Omex and wire it up to suit rather than trying to reverse engineer the scooby loom. Also, the scooby cooling system wouldn't fit so you'd need to make something up their too.\n<br> \n<br> Are you thinking Turbo or NatAsp?\n<br> \n<br> I know Neil is looking for a flat 6 motor out of a SVX - certainly different!!",

I know a few people who have fitted Scoobies - takes an average of about 6 months and lots of probs like overheating. Fit a nicely built aircooled - reliable economical motors IMO \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

    "content" : "Hi dan\n<br> \n<br> Having done a subaru conversion in my old bay, I can certainly recommend it. \n<br> \n<br> With all due respect, you'll get a lot of opinion from people who have never done a conversion or even driven one. You can make the conversion as simple or complex as you want, you don't HAVE to use the twin turbo motor, you don't HAVE to have a porsche gbox, you don't HAVE to have a remappable ECU... you get the idea.\n<br> \n<br> You can easily do the conversion for less than the cost of a big aircooled motor &amp; end up with more power, reliability AND a proper heating system! There is a luddite element in the VW 'scene'who will consider such a conversion close to blasphemy, how you deal with that is up to you...\n<br> \n<br> Unless you plan on remapping for more power, there is little point having an aftermarket ECU as the Subaru one is more than capable.\n<br> \n<br> A complete donor car would be the best way to go, that way you know you have everything you need. I got my Subaru Legacy for £100, but that was lucky. You can get an adaptor &amp; flywheel from DS Tuning in Germany for £300 - far cheaper than Kennedy. The harness can be modified by companies in the UK, RJES &amp; TSR for example. This will cost £250-ish &amp; I would recommend this as it is by far the most difficult part.\n<br> \n<br> If you have decent fabrication skills, you can make your own exhaust, engine support bar, radiator mount (mine was underneath - NEVER overheated). There are myriad extra things which need to be modified or purchased e.g. fuel return system, radiator ducting etc, but it's all good if you have an inquisitive mind &amp; are up for a challenge.\n<br> \n<br> Like bobley says, have a look at vwkd.com and other sites, loads of people (including me) have done these conversions - you can learn loads from them.\n<br> \n<br> Hope that helps,\n<br> \n<br> Mark",
