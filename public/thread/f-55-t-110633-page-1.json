    "content" : "Cheers mate much appreciated ,I'm am going to check it out this Saturday , but as you quite rightly say it's not on the DVLA website. I had seen this bus a few years back at dubs at the beach. the damage which you can't see is to the rear near side quarter whilst not massive is significant and over two panels will be a few quid to fix. Thanks for the info though it's appreciated. I will post how I get on cheers colin",

    "content" : "Hi Julian , well it did sell and went to a very hire company \" rainbow camper hire\" in the Lake District. I asked the owner \" caz\" some questions . Even got the v5 ref number , the DVLA still wouldn't recognise it or the reg number. As samba63 said it looked dubious .i got the info from the m plate , and it didn't seem to link to a right hand van , it was for a German van used in Germany. The side doors are on the offside as should be for a left hooker but not a right hooker. Anyway no good me commenting really , I told caz I wouldn't be going to have a look. But thanks for your comment much appreciated,nth search goes on.... Or maybe I should just finish what u have got..mc here's colin",

    "content" : "Hi Colin / Julian, It was me that bought it. You are right, it didn't take much to decide it was definitely a van to spend the winter working on rather than \"lovely\" as the owner said! I'm glad I went to look rather than going off the pictures. As to the history, it is a bit \"trans gender\" having had the swap to RHD when imported in 2003. Originally a LHD panel van, first reg in Rome, then converted to a bus with proper window insets. It has velvet green paint below many others (pink among them!). Conversion to RHD has been done very well with proper dash, floor etc but the cargo doors and Dormobile roof have been left as they were. Caz had it from 2004 to now so plenty of family history but not used for 4 years and not MOT'd for 2. It needs the accident repair but also sills both sides and some work on almost every panel but underneath is great and the mechanicals aren't far off. Not sure why it didn't show up on DVLA search but had no probs with change of owner. Might have it ready to hire by June next year! I need to change my SSVC ID to \"7Dubs\" now....
