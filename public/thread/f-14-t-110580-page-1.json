    "content" : "I am contemplating cycling to the train station for work. It's just over 8 miles and quite hilly.\n<br>\n<br>Did a test run today on my mtb (\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://claudbutler.co.uk/cycle-range...tler-atb/b2744\">http://claudbutler.co.uk/cycle-range...tler-atb/b2744</a>\n<!-- m -->) it took me 42 mins and was really hard work!!\n<br>Hasn't quite put me off but has made me think again. Would appreciate some advice on a few points:\n<br>1) how much easier would it be on a different type of bike?\n<br>2) what would best? Road? Hybrid? Cyclocross(whatever that is!)?\n<br>3) what's the minimum I would need to spend (happy to go 2nd hand/eBay)\n<br>4) if anyone has one their looking to sell or can let me know about a good deal would appreciate it!\n<br>5) is this any good ? \n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike...oad-bike-2015#\">http://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike...oad-bike-2015#</a>\n<!-- m -->[object%20Object]\n<br>6) in the interim could I just get different tyres for my existing bike?\n<br>\n<br>Finally, will my arse ever not feel like I've done too much prison time and will I inevitably spend a lot more time in Lycra ?!?!?!",

Your a**e will get used to it after a few days, whereas a big sofa saddle will hurt you forever. \n<br>\n<br>I used to wear the padded Lycra shorts underneath some normal shorts until I got my confidence up on the commuter train to go just with the spray-ons. It helps if you take your bike on the train as an accessory to the shorts, otherwise you just look like you've worn Lycra for fun. \n<br>\n<br>And as above, swap your wheels or buy a cheap old racer that no one wants to steal.",
