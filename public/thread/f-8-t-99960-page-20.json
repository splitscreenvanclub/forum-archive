Unfortunately Tyler's engine wasn't the right spec for a bus, more of a beetle motor soI bailed on that one, but looks like the Tdi plan is shelved and a nice Type IV turbo motor is on the cards!! \n  <br>\n  <br>Literally havent touched the van for weeks now, we are putting a log burner in our house ready for Winter so my time has been spent knee deep in brick rubble and soot. Hoping to be back on he van next week though all been well. \n  <br>\n  <br>Anyone know what kind of power a 6 rib Type 2 bus can handle without beefing the internals up? The Type IV will be putting out a decent amount of torque so need to know wether that needs attention first! \n  <br>\n  <br>Cheers guys, \n  <br>\n  <br>Hopefully back to normal next week!\n </div>\n</blockquote>\n<br>\n<br>TDI shelved! Shame I was looking forward to seeing that! \n<br>\n<br>I put 300bhp from an Impreza motor through an 091 6 rib without any issues, I didn't ever give it a really hard time from standing start though.[/quote] \n<br>\n<br>I know Im gutted too in a way but we've had so much abuse about putting it in a 15 window, plus we were always that little bit dubious ourselves. \n<br>I think the thought of a Type iv even though that specific one didn't work out, appealed and helped us to go with out hearts rather than our head, my wife has never been convinced to be honest, I just kept on about how practical it would be!!\n<br>\n<br>Type iv on efi with a nice dual map setup should be good though. Not as torquey as a tdi but more in keeping and no slouch either. \n<br>\n<br>Need to have a look at how far ahead you've gotten now with yours, will have a read when Im back home in half an hour!! \n<br>\n<br>Cheers for the headsup on the 091 too, looks like thats the way to go then...",
