    "content" : "Hi, I'm actually currently on a site at the moment called Beech Croft Farm which is between Buxton and Bakewell off the A6 and about 30 miles from Tatton I think.\n<br>Current cost is Â£12.50 for the van, awning and 2 adults, electric is on a pay as you go basis. You get a card with credit on it and at the end of your stay what you don't use is refunded.\n<br>The site is immaculate and the toilet block is like new.\n<br>\n<br>It's cold and wet at the moment but with free wifi Mrs Reb can watch xfactor while I catch up on the Forum.\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",
