Bit of a mystery topic\n<br> \n<br> There is a degree of confusion regarding the specification of brake fluid and this article sets\n<br> out to clarify the situation.\n<br> The Department of Transportation (DOT) classifies brake fluids to defined specifications.\n<br> These specifications relate to their boiling points and chemical composition, both of which\n<br> are important. All currently available brake fluids are covered by one of the following\n<br> specifications; DOT3, DOT4, DOT5 and DOT5.1.\n<br> The laws of thermo-dynamics dictate that the energy from motion is turned into heat through\n<br> friction. A braking system only works efficiently if the fluid remains incompressible. If the\n<br> brake fluid boils, it turns to gas, which is compressible and the braking system becomes\n<br> “spongy” or in extreme cases fails completely.\n<br> A brake system is not perfectly sealed and moisture can get into the system and be\n<br> absorbed by the fluid. The effect is to reduce the boiling point of the fluid, which reduces the\n<br> efficiency of the braking system, as described above.\n<br> The DOT specifies two reference tests for brake fluids.\n<br> * Dry boiling point - the boiling point of fresh fluid\n<br> * Wet boiling point –the boiling point once the fluid has absorbed moisture\n<br> (representing brake fluid after time spent in a real situation).\n<br> There are two main types of brake fluids:\n<br> * DOT 3, DOT 4, Super DOT4* and DOT 5.1 which are based on poly glycol\n<br> compounds.\n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">* DOT 5, which are based on Silicone.</strong>\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">Note the two types of fluid are not compatible and must not be mixed in<br> a braking system.</strong>\n<br> \n<br> SILICONE BRAKE FLUID (DOT 5)\n<br> Silicone based DOT 5 was originally introduced to give higher temperature performance over\n<br> glycol DOT 4. Silicone fluid also has other advantages, it does not damage paintwork and it\n<br> does not absorb water.\n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">However, silicone fluid is a poor lubricant and does not lubricate ABS pumps as well as PAG<br> fluids. It is also more compressible than PAG fluids, which can result in a sluggish or spongy<br> pedal.</strong> It therefore requires special design considerations in braking systems. Further,\n<br> because it does not absorb water, \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">any water remains as globules, which can pool in low<br> spots in the system and cause corrosion</strong>. This water can vaporise when heated under heavy\n<br> braking giving a disastrous effect on braking efficiency.\n<br> DOT5 fluids are not recommended for motor sport applications.\n<br> \n<br> POLY GLYCOL BRAKE FLUIDS (DOT 3, 4 AND 5.1)\n<br> Glycol based DOT 4 fluid is the current mainstream brake fluid, and you will see that the\n<br> specification is considerably better than DOT 3 which it replaces.\n<br> DOT 5.1 has higher specification still and is for fast road and occasional track day use. It has\n<br> a similar spec to DOT4 for the boiling point (&gt;260) but is a lot lower viscosity @-40C typically\n<br> 900 centistokes (compared to 1500 - 1800 centistokes for DOT 4 and super DOT 4).\n<br> Listed in the table below, are the minimum dry/wet boiling point specifications for each DOT\n<br> level.\n<br> BOILING POINT:\n<br> DOT 3 - 205°C (dry) / 140°C (wet)\n<br> DOT 4 - 230°C (dry) / 155°C (wet)\n<br> DOT 5 (silicone) - 260°C (dry) / 185°C (wet)\n<br> DOT 5.1 (PAG) - 260°C (dry) / 185°C (wet)\n<br> Super Dot4 * - 300°C (dry) / 195°C (wet)\n<br> (racing brake fluid)\n<br> * Super DOT4: The main difference between DOT 4 and Super DOT 4 is the dry boiling\n<br> point. Normal Dot4 is &gt;260C whilst Super DOT 4 is more like &gt;310C\n<br> With thanks to Martyn Mann - Technical Director Millers Oils.",

Everyday is a school day!\n<br> \n<br> So Dot 5 cannot be mixed with Dot 3 or Dot 4, but can Dot 3 or Dot 4 be mixed? I only ask as how do you tell what you currently have in a bus if you have not installed a new system from scratch?",
