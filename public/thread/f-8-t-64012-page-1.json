    "content" : "I acquired a 1969 Hamburg Westfalia trailer some time ago. I bought it from a neighbour over the road. My eldest son told me about it, he had seen “this trailer made like a splitscreen” parked at the back of the neighbour’s garden, when the gates were open. I though my son must be mistaken at first, but eventually “saw” it myself...\n<br> I asked my neighbour if I could have a look at it and he showed me round. It had belonged to his employer George Kukka (Watford, Birmingham &amp; Glasgow) and he had towed the van behind a sand coloured Volvo. It was one of two built specially for the Company to take machine tools to exhibitions. It was fitted out with a power input to a fuse board, switches and two fluorescent lights in the front corners. My neighbour on his retirement had bought the trailer to move things around. It had done good service moving furniture for his family and relatives and friends....but had eventually fallen into disrepair and had not been used for a few years and pushed into a corner of his garden.\n<br> I had to have this and asked the neighbour if he wanted to sell it and he said no but he would think about it... His wife said I would get it at some time...sooner or later!\n<br> He does not enjoy good health and has at times been quite poorly and hospitalised several times. \n<br> When it was their wedding anniversary and they were going to have a garden party, she came over and said I could have it! I paid very little for it! It then was towed over the road onto my front drive. The gutters were very rotten and the lower panels were very bad, the floor was rotten but I had never seen one like it before.\n<br> It has a panelling which covers the wheels in wheel arch tubs inside the body, with twin opening doors at the rear and one side door and has a braked alko chassis with suspension.\n<br> I thought it would look good towed behind my type21f fire truck. \n<br> I planned to restore it to it’s former glory....I started making enquiries\n<br> \n<br> \n<strong class=\"text-strong\">Restore it before it drops apart</strong>\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/Trailer%20as%20was/CIMG0501.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
