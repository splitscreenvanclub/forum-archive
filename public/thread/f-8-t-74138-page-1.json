    "content" : "I saw a thread in the \"Devon Forum\" saying that there was a Devon in the \"For Sale\" section. \n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=53987\">http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=53987</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>Thanks Jonnolly!\n<br>I read the advert (and looked at the photobucket pictures) at a lovely Devon Caravette located South of Edinburgh and I knew I wanted it for my sons (myself [emoji38] ). \n<br>\n<br>It turned out that the owner was in poor health and a friend had placed the advert. It took quite a few emails and pms to sort out exactly where the bus was located and who was selling it. A few were interested but the bus was a long way.... I pm'd and then I contacted my son who lives South of Edinburgh to go and see the bus...\n<br>He could not go that weekend but the owner wanted the bus to stay in Scotland, so he was patient. He had owned the bus for twenty years and travelled all over Scotland and to the VW shows in Scotland. The bus was located not far from the advertiser but was also still near to my son. By a stroke of fate my daughter in law actually knew the advertiser as a patient in a local practise! \n<br>My son went to see the Caravette and was impressed with the condition of the interior and general state of the bus and could see the potential (through the rust). He does know his way round splitties...\n<br>It had been in the Borders all its life and it sure does rain there. It had undergone some restoration and had been repainted but had also then stood outside for around four years under all weathers.. \n<br>\n<br>and so starts the fairy tale of owning another Devon...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060005.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060011.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/PC060013.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310001.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310002.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310003.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310004.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310006.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310007.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310008.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310009.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310010.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310011.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310013.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310014.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Engine lid hinges upside down!\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310015.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/P1310016.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

They were not too popular...had never seen another...so was very surprised...\n<br>\n<br>Your 1964 bus with the lift up flap and shaving mirror on the flap will be the 1964 model year. The 1964 interior with the lift up flap was a one year only interior. Before this the unit was an open frame like a westy.",

He phoned to confirm collection plans and to apologise for having to change the arrangements because his trailer lighting was in need of attention.\n<br>He confirmed new times and arrived promptly and collected the bus and off it went on the trailer..\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://s619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/IMG_0153.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/IMG_0151.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/van_1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i619.photobucket.com/albums/tt273/type21f/1964%20Devon%20Caravette/van_2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

It has had an engine swap and been converted to 12v and has been filled a little and resprayed...but then the last 20years owner had matured and suffered ill health so he felt he had to sell before it deteriorated too much. After four years stood outside in the challenging rain and snow of the Scottish Borders all the doors were rusted solid shut and it had lots of rusted out small holes and some larger holes....\n<br>\n<br>So whilst I'm OK to drive a rusty OG this was originally to be a rolling resto but then I thought why not we can all drive her and so it will be a repair and paint but refit the OG interior...\n<br>\n<br>You only live once..or twice..\n<br>\n<br>Dave's got the skills and I'm still enjoying what I do...so...It will be restored metal work and mechanical upgrade for the boys girls and grandchildren...Like a rolling pension fund...",
