He's the forth relative in the last 4 years to have a form of this evil disease, he was the only smoker (and that was years ago) two others were fitness fanatics. Hopefully the we get there in time, but I'm just sick of it. So if there is a show/holiday/bus/day out/treat for the kids you keep putting off just do it now, this time last year he had all the time in the world. Gary( hoping for the best, but expecting the worst).",
