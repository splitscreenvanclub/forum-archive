    "content" : "JUst testing the water really as I bought this as I always wanted one then bought my high top and it hasnt moved since!\n<br>Did a couple of Prom nights in it recently but other than that I cannot see me getting round to doing anything with it. It is a very unusual bus being made from mainly split parts, it came from south africa. It is unbelievable to drive with servo assisted large five drum brakes all round that stop you dead! better than any disc brake buses i have driven. It has a trekker drive train on reduction boxes that feels like it wants to eat the road. Standard 1600 TP engine, split steering column and handbrake! right hand drive with full Kombi seating. It is not a minter but is solid. Had so many ideas about what it was going to look like but for last 8 months it hasnt got a look in! Any questions feel free to get in contact and can also send loads of pictures.\n<br>Price around Â£9500\n<br>Ben 07885282387",
