Am I still going to be able to kick myself as I won't be able to enjoy the frustration of doing an aggressive 3 point turn in the middle of the road and speed towards home.

London DLR has them, monitored via CCTV and on a very bid computer system in a warehouse. They're not even controlled remotely by a person, it's fully automated and the people in the control room just monitor them in case there's any problems or speed them up/slow them down to keep the intervals between them consistent. It's quite impressive in the control room and takes fewer people than you realise to run the system. \n<br>\n<br>Seeing how most of the school run mums drive where I live I think it could be a good thing \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>Cheers, Lee.",
