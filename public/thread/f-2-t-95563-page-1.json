    "content" : "I thought I'd start a little page about my experience with a so called \"Professional\" VW restoration garage in Evesham.\n<br> \n<br> I was going to do this work myself, but as I was too busy at work at the time, so I decided to let the 'professionals' do it for me. \n<br> I had a quote to replace my old 2\" narrowed bay window ball joint beam on my 1959 splitty for a complete new front end, which included:\n<br> \n<br> 4.5 Slamwerks beam\n<br> Reconditioned dropped spindles \n<br> CSP Disk kit\n<br> 4 Trailing arms bottom ones narrowed.\n<br> Narrowed leaves\n<br> linkpins \n<br> Narrowed tie rods and ends\n<br> Splitscreen swing arm\n<br> Trailing arm seals \n<br> Lowered shocks and fittings\n<br> full hardware kit.\n<br> \n<br> The 'Professional' (which by the way, was someone I used to call one of my best friends of over 25 years), said he could do it for the same cost as I had been quoted for all the same parts listed by the other company, but because the CSP brakes were going to be secondhand (done approx 3000 miles, but he would clean them all up, put new bearings, seals, brake hoses, pads on and resurface the disc's), he would also raise my steering box and fit a dual master cylinder at the same time. I greed to the deal and paid him in cash upfront for the work (He was a best friend of over 25 years after all, so no reason not to trust!).\n<br> \n<br> I took the van over to his garage on May 4th 2013. He gave me a time scale of 1 week and told me to collect it on May 11th. I told him that would be superb, but if he need another week that would be no problem, as long as I had it back by then (18th May).\n<br> \n<br> To cut a very, very long story short and after many, many lies, phone calls, text's and visits I was told my van was ready for collection (June 22nd), 6 weeks later than he first told me it would be ready!!!\n<br> \n<br> The drive back from the 'Professional VW Restoration Garage in Evesham\" last week was one of the most scariest experiences ever â€“ no really, EVER!\n<br> \n<br> I shouldn't have really driven it, but I just wanted to get it back home as he had messed me around so much. On the journey back home, the van was swaying around across the road so much that I nearly had 5 accidents. The brakes were awful and several loud bands could be heard along the way. I managed to get up to a top speed of about 30mph... believe me, that was very scary.\n<br> \n<br> When I eventually got home, I put it straight into my garage, jacked him up and had a look underneath to see what on earth he had done to my pride and joy. To say I was shocked, would be an understatement. I found 6 bolts that were loose that I could take off with my fingers and all the track rod ends I managed to do 3 turns with a spanner before feeling any tightness!!!\n<br> \n<br> My eyes were then drawn to the attention of the steering centre pin. He had assembled it wrong. This is where I started taking photo's and I'll be putting them on here so show you what this 'professional' has done.",
