    "content" : "IMHO having the cooler inside the engine bay is a bad idea. You're expelling heat, (from the oil), into the engine bay, which then is blown over the barrels / heads. Even a margin heat rise inside the engine bay is going to have some sort of effect on the cooling of the engine.\n<br> \n<br> And having the oil filters in the engine bays, generally, means they're mounted high up so oil drains back to the case so oil pressure takes longer to build up on startup. Plus they can get in the way when doing your general servicing / oil spill when doing a filter change = very messy engine bay.",

    "content" : "I have the same set up from Laurrie as Rippers. Don't fit it all in the engine bay as you will, as Jim said, heat up the air in the engine bay. Mine has the pipes going into a mocal swirl pot with an autometer temp sender in the top and then into the rear quarter and through the bit where the battery would sit if it wasn't on the other side then into a filter housing bolted so the filter sits horizontally. it used to hang down but I smacked it on a kerb and left a slick, luckily mrs empi noticed it and shouted and waved her arms about a lot until I shut the engine off before I did any damage. The pipes are then attached to the inner arch by P clips and go over the wheel and under the bus to a mocal thermostat and then from there into a 13 row mocal cooler. the thermostat stops the oil going through the cooler until it hits 180 degrees. \n<br> If you call think automotive they should have it all in stock and can supply the correct thread in the top of the swirl pot. Don't bother with the el-cheapo Chinese cooler its false economy, buy a decent one from mocal/think automotive. \n<br> If you need any pics let me know. \n<br> \n<br> Shalom, Lee.",
