The only issue I have is that it is a pain to attach to the bus so I don't bother - I just have bus and awning near each other. I have read lots of threads about the best way to attach the 2 and many users seem perfectly happy. It seems difficult to get clamps attached firmly without damaging you roof gutter.\n<br> \n<br> Here is a pic from WILL:\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1117.photobucket.com/user/steve8smith/media/Vanoncampsite2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1117.photobucket.com/albums/k588/steve8smith/Vanoncampsite2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Another tip - if the weather is bad, drive to the campsite looking cool in your bus. Then hire yourself a static caravan with central heating etc.!",

Takes up a bit of space in the bus but is worth it for the ease of use and space it gives you when you arrive. Honestly takes less than 5 minutes to put up on my own.

It may be that they're not using it correctly but it did end up in them storming off home on the first night away once as they were so p'd off with it.\n<br> \n<br> Read lots of reviews and go for what you want dude.\n<br> \n<br> Nick",

    "content" : "I have to disagree with maclarni, The Royal Traveller Tunnel awning I had was awesome! Didn't take too long to put up and withstood the fiercest weather ( bigbang 2012 included) Downside was it didn't seal brilliantly to the ground so could be a bit drafty, the best £40 I've spent on an awning. I lost it off the roofrack on the a12 racing a fit bird in a corsa (she won!) went back for it but it had disappeared!\n<br> \n<br> This was our other one an outwell florida highway, spent quite a bit of time choosing this one as the other outwells seemed to only leave you with a corridor area after you had put the sleeping bit in, this one we could put our table and chairs, cooking facilitys and fridge and still have plenty of room to move.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1085.photobucket.com/user/thesickness1/media/DSCF0909.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1085.photobucket.com/albums/j430/thesickness1/DSCF0909.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> Lovely quality awning, not the quickest thing to put up and VERY heavy when packed up. It served our family of 5 well as the lazy teenagers could sleep in the sleeping compartment whilst I got up and made breakfast etc...\n<br> \n<br> Nowadays think I'd go for the smaller kyham quick erect jobby as family circumstances have changed, it'll either be me and the Girlfriend, me and the Daughter or me and the Stepson so we dont need a massive awning. ...Maybe change tact and go for a gazebo and/ or a small pup tent to store deckchairs etc, certainly a lot cheaper than an awning that never properly fits a lowered bus!\n<br> \n<br> I guess the main thing for choosing an awning is the size of your family, thats why one can have a small collection of awnings suitable for every occasion lol",

Getting the poles in and tensioned up to form a semi circle was a real pain and in the end was a limiting factor to wanting to move between sites. It was sturdy though, it just flexed in strong winds. Quick erect is the way forward, especially if you want to keep moving.\n<br> \n<br> SC\n<br> ~~",
