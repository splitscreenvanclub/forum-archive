    "content" : "Hi\n<br>\n<br>I think one of the brake switches on my new DCMC is weeping. I had problems with it not sealing during the installation, but cranked it up and it stopped. Now there is evidence of brake fluid tracking from the fitting again...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDY-PC/TruckPics/DSC_0546_zps0iidtlyh.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Ironically, it's a new switch. The one that I transplanted from the old MC is fine.\n<br>\n<br>I'm checking to eliminate whether it's spillage from the bleeding process working its way down, but I've a feeling it's the switch.\n<br>\n<br>Have read about someone having a problem with the switch shaft snapping when they tried to stop a leak, so am I screwed? Will hydraulic thread sealant fix it? If so, do I need to bleed the whole system again, or just get the fluid out of the reservoir, and bleed the problem circuit after I'm done?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Andy",

If your that concerned then use Ptfe paste instead but I'm not sure that will seal as effectively as tape or re-bleed the entire system after putting the switch back in to flush out the debris.",

I think the master cylinder has a tapered thread.\n<br>\n<br>If so, only the leading couple of turns on the switch threads would ever form the seal. That's also why I don't want to over-tighten (don't want to strip them).\n<br>\n<br>I'm guessing the leading turns on mine aren't machined that well. A paste might be the answer (better at gap-filling).",

If so, it would simplify the job.\n<br>\n<br>Also, as I'm just working on the one circuit, will I need to bleed both circuits after? I have a little spare fluid left from when I filled up, and the reservoir is still brimming (over max), so I'm hoping that I can get away with what I've got.",
