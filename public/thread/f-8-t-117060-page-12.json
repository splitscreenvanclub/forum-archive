If its two pack then you can rub down the lid with 800 wet and dry and paint with solid colour if its in good condition, if it is chipped and scratched then feather out the scratches with paper on a block but not too coarse, I wouldn't go under 240 grit. Prime with high build primer (2K) and give it about 4/5 coats if its a 5 to 1 primer. Allow to dry and then rub down with 800 wet and dry.",
