    "content" : "Hi, My engine is 1641cc Twin carbs,009 distributer no vacuum advance,electronic ign,044 heads.Can't seem to find a correct timing setting. 7.5 deg ATDC? 7.5 deg BTDC? or 10 deg ATDC? What about running unleaded or v power 99 octane.It seems to run ok at the moment but its been guess work to find a happy place.Found video on the net to time with a test light but is this technique for points only distributor?\n<br> Any suggestions?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks in advance.

VW magazines.\n<br> \n<br> The traders gave the mags lots of money in advertising, and they only sold 009 replacement distributors. They gave away free distributors to be put into articles, and the magazines wrote about how good they were.\n<br> \n<br> If it is replacing an old knackered dizzy with worn points, a 009 probably is better (well at least if it is an old one). But a decent vacuum will always be much better.\n<br> \n<br> Also remember in the USA they had vacuum retard dizzys to meet emissions, a 009 is probably better than those as well",
