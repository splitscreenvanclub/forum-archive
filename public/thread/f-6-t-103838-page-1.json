    "content" : "If you do a search on oil types you'll find plenty of threads where normal, sane people get incredibly agitated about which oil they should use in their aircooled engine. There are broadly two schools of thought - one prefer to use a straight 30 oil - the other prefer to use a multigrade, typically 20-50. Then there are the arguments about detergent and non detergent oils. There's also a view that there's no value in using synthetic or semi synthetic oils. \n<br> \n<br> Personally, I think what's most important is to change it regularly - minimum every 3000 miles or annually - and don't use anything lower than 15 if you're using a multigrade - it will leak.",

The bottle neck will fit almost perfect inside the filler neck so you don't spill it everywhere. Also it's easier to carry a couple of 500ml bottles of oil than a gallon and easier to top it up in the motorway services. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers, Lee.",
