I agree with the earlier suggestion on A34, A43, A5. Followed a couple last year part way who went that way and I went up to Warwick. They were much quicker than us.\n<br>\n<br>Anyway we could meet at chievely services on A34, M4 junction on your way and close to us if you like. If that works please just pm me.\n<br>\n<br>the 2 club members with me -one is having mechanicals and unsure and the other is coming up Saturday afternoon. So please just let me know and if not I'll trundle up and see you there.\n<br>\n<br>carl",
