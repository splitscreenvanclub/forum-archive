    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>I really like your industry..I have a thread running in the Devon forum about Devon cots. I am very much in admiration of your OG looking Westy cot and poles and brackets.\n<br>Is the canvas green or grey? i like the cot boot you have made and wanted to enquire about making a full length boot/ bag to take the entire rolled up cot with sewn ends and poppers! So the cot could be rolled up and put in the bag and stowed in the bus somewhere, probably behind the front seats.\n<br>Whilst I would like to fit a westy version I am looking to make a copy of the Devon one.\n<br>I have pictures of the brackets and the poles and I will be making a Devon CAD version.. (cardboard aided design) The material I will be using will be Ross Portobello Stria and I'll probably need to use double thickness of material...because it is not as thick/stiff as the canvas\n<br>I aim to make some brackets and poles and set the height to match the pictures of the Devon cot I have!\n<br>I note your cot does not reach the ends of the poles, was this to match the OG dimensions?\n<br>\n<br>Any advice would be very much appreciated! I'll probably not be doing the sewing so advice on thread strength and needles etc would help?\n<br>\n<br>I can get pole lengths from thesamba but the devon poles sit in a different position no doubt.\n<br>How high are your poles up he A &amp; B posts?\n<br>\n<br>Regards Graham",
