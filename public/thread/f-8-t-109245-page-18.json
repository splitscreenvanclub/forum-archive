And no of course not dude fire away take whatever you need.\n<br> \n<br> Ive been having a much needed break from the bus after volksworld! The run up nearly killed me and I definitely needed take a few days off. \n<br> \n<br> I had been having gearbox issues some of which documented above already. All of which coming from what would seem the combination of the fancy billet nose cone i had bought and my early 1500 swing axe box. For volksworld the bus only had two forward gears and no reverse \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br> \n<br> This had been playing on my mind, yesterday was my first day off so prime time to get it back on the ramp and take another look. \n<br> \n<br> Gratuitous pics just cause the light was so lovely in the workshop yesterday morning!\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2806/33052224244_a43f87b355_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2841/33052226174_ab51ec0042_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> On the ramp which is no mean feet on your own!

In this configuration i was using what i believed to be a a bus hockey stick and this billet nose cone. When trying to select reverse no matter what we tried it was grinding badly and would not go in. \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2856/33739351212_f782a90685_h.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Scoring by the hockey stick bush\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2806/33052195884_2ac5fb904d_h.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> I had a original bus nose cone in my stash so compared the two. The recess for the kink in the original hockey stick is significant and not present on the the billet one\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3948/33739354072_4f988a2e4b_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2902/33739352822_f6d003fdb0_z.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Basically after much deliberation and the arrival of my infinitely knowledgeable buddy Colin who spotted the issue straight away we sorted it. The hockey stick i thought was bus due to the kink was actually beetle that somebody had tried to bend in the past but hadn't actually bent it enough. So when trying to select reverse it was actually selecting two gears at the same time hence the grinding noise. So a blow torch, vice and a hammer and Col bent the hockey stick the correct amount and it works a treat. Ive ditched the billet nose cone as it just wont work with my current early 1500. Gaz luckily had bought another nose cone mount for his bus that he let me pinch and attach to my original bus nose cone meaning that it could all go back together there and then \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> Happy boy!!\n<br> \n<br> Test fitting to make sure I could get all the gears\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2891/33739351742_ce1ab86bfd_h.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> A few hours later and i had a running bus again complete with all gears!!!\n<br> \n<br> Popped into the unit after work today and drove it out and took it round our site. I had my camera today so took a couple of snaps. I didnt have much time so only a few. I need to take more to show how great the headliner is for Austin &amp; Tom over at Waboo Automotive.....\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2841/33895659935_d6201014cb_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2887/33895660405_fca5275b3f_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2882/33052209264_a8d6db6089_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3951/33052207234_19a3582171_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2830/33052210624_856f1c5b37_k.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> Dare i say it but it was actually too low to drive, after only the few hundred meters it had driven i had gotten fully stuck twice \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> So I raised it a little yesterday too.
