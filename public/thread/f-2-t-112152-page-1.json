Your bus will get plenty of attention over there as not many around!\n<br>\n<br>Some good course fishing around where you are in Lower Lough Erne - depends what your after though. A few smaller lakes with some really big pike - Moorlough (couple of miles outside Lisnaskea) is a favourite of mine - pulled some big fish out of there, had a 2 and a half pound perch when I was a kid, but some big pike and bream in there. Bit difficult to fish due to the reeds sometimes, but my dad has a fishing boat on it. If you are there for a while I am happy to give him a call and sort something for you. We also have a small fishing boat on Lough Erne. It's normally moored close to the Watermill Restaurant at Kilmore Quay, if you are interested let me know and I will check if the boats are still in the water and you are welcome to have the use of them.\n<br>\n<br>Frank",
