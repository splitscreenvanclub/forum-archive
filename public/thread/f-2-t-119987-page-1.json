    "content" : "Go and play \"pitch and put\" in Holywell bay just south of Newquay.\n<br> \n<br> It's a pretty\" different\" golf experience - I don't play by the way - but I do enjoy this course as it's the most fun golf experience I know.\n<br> \n<br> I don't want to ruin the surprise / fun by telling you what to expect, other than it not your normal pitch and put type course.\n<br> \n<br> Great way to enjoy an hour or so by the sea for £7 or £9 maybe £11 as it's been a good few years since I've been down.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> The minac theater is worth a visit even if you don't see a show.\n<br> \n<br> One last place I'd highly recommend is the Eden Project. If you haven't been before its just an absolute must.\n<br> The first time I visited I just couldn't believe what I was seeing from the viewing platform, and that before you get close. Truly one of the county's best attractions. Look for the plants whose \"leaves close up\" when you run your finger up them. They're kind of like pine leaves, short thin spikes, similar to rosemary.\n<br> \n<br> Have a fun trip\n<br> \n<br> Jason",
