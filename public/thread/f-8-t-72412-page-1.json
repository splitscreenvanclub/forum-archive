    "content" : "Well it's something that I knew was going to need to happen at some point and after 9 years of ownership, the time is nigh.\n<br> \n<br> My dear old bus is getting somewhat the worse for wear and is in need of a full resto. I've spent ages deliberating whether to flog it and just buy a new bus, but the heart says no. Unfortunately its part of the familly and it will probably be with us until we're old and infirm (the kids needn't think they're getting their hands on it..).\n<br> \n<br> Anyway, she's a rhd 64 11 window bus, originally purchased and delivered to Devon for conversion before going to the first owner in Weymouth Dorset. Being a typical UK bus, she's shafted and has been 'restored' many times over the past 40+ years. This usually involved newspaper and chicken wire/filler, with the old sheet metal plate welded straight over rusty holes. During my ownership, I've replaced bits properly as they were needed, as well as thrown some paint at it. However there are some serious problems that just cant be left now and so I'm taking the plunge and sorting her out properly with the thought that hopefully it will be the last time for the next decade (or 2 hopefully).\n<br> \n<br> I'll take some pictures once its stripped, but effectively theres severe gutter rot in the offside rear corner and along that gutter due to the MW poptop.\n<br> The chasis is ropey in places as is the front panel valance (which we lashed up when we painted it last time). All doors are knackered, at least one seal is knackered as are all the outriggers, top hats etc. Front windows are holey under the seals, cab floors got huge plates, as have the wheele wells.. blah blah blah. Basically its a big enough job.\n<br> \n<br> So the mission has started and I expect it to take about 16 months , which isn't a problem as we have a new baby due in July so we wouldn't use it much this year anyway.",
