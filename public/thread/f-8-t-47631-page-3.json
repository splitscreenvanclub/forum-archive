There is more lead filling than I expected around the top of the B pillar, now I have dug into that I can see how the pillar joins to the over cab door piece and I think I understand how the drip channel joins. On this van it seems water sat in the drip tray and with no engine in it ran to the front and rotted out the cab end worst. The right A pillar is more (really!) rotten, I think that was the drain route. I should get more time on it tomorrow, hopefully get some metal welded back in. \n<br>\n<br>I have used loads of the thin 1mm cutting discs on a standard 115mm grinder, I have a 90 degree die grinder which has been really useful with either a carbide burr or I also discovered roloc twist in things with 75mm clean and strip pads, but something more like a mini grinding disc and something less harsh than the carbide burr would be useful without going to dremel stuff, any ideas?\n<br>\n<br>Here is what I found in the under the front.

    "content" : "Did a little more Chassis rail beam mount but not much over Xmas.\n<br>\n<br>I found some pics on theBustransfer.com site of a 53 they did, nice work. They cut off the end of the roof support to fix it then welded it back in, seems easier to remove the whole thing since both ends of the forward one are shot, there are not too many spot welds in the center of the support joining it to the roof panel. It looks like the front support has slots for the cabling, and the rear support just 8mm holes, as your replacement support does too Spit.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://thebustransfer.com/Project_Archive/Pages/53_Kombi_files/Media/2012_03300012/2012_03300012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>I have a spot welder so I am considering repairing the roof as a panel on the van but not joining it back to the gutter as I go, and then remove the remaining spot welds at the back and lift the whole thing off making it easier to get to the rest of the gutter etc. Then reassemble like factory - spot the strengtheners to the roof edges and supports, drop the roof onto the gutter and spot around the outside and along the strengthener on the inside.\n<br>\n<br>Does this sound correct? Anyone see any issues? Done it before?",
