    "content" : "Hi Ollie, they are really hard to find , I bought my first split a few years ago which is a SO42 and I sold the interior which I often wonder if I have done the right thing but as my retired father who is very ill wanted to build me a bespoke interior in oak I couldn't resist and the end result is fantastic. The interior I sold had very small holes drilled all over it as the previous owner was a locksmith in Albuquergue and had key blanks hanging everywhere, that interior complete sold for best part of Â£2000 the interest I had in it was immense , even now nearly 2 years later I have the occasional email asking if I have any bits left. \n<br>Regards Iain.",
