(and as far as I'm aware NOT for sale) The owners now know all the problems with the incorrect bodywork, but rather just use it and enjoy it. They bought it to use, not restore. (It often sits on the forecourt of the garage so gets lots of attention) I don't think they are on the forum, but I know I wouldn't like to have all the faults in my bus picked out by everyone. \n<br> \n<br>Ta!",
