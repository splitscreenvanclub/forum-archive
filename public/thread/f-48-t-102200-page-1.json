    "content" : "I am in the process of getting some Canterbury Pitt badges/decals/plaque professionally made up , the ones that go either on the side of the cooker or on the outside just below the swage line. They will be in the form of a sticker and not the original metal badge but will not be cheap and nasty. They will be in the correct 6cm x 4cm size and correct colour (black and shiny silver). They will also be laminated so they are durable and will not fade if put on the outside of your bus. I am planning to stick mine onto a piece of stainless or ally plate so it resembles the original plaque then bond it to the outside of my bus.\n<br>Obviously it is not cheap to get all this done as i will have to pay for the artwork to be re-done from a photo (cheers funky)so it is of a sufficient standard to be printed onto a sticker.\n<br>I am wondering if there is any interest before i commit to going ahead. I would anticipate that each sticker will cost about Â£4 each plus postage at cost ie a stamp.\n<br>If intersted please add your name below. If you say you want one please dont back out or i will be left considerably out of pocket.\n<br>\n<br>shalom, Lee",
