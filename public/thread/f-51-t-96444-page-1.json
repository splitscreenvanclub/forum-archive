    "content" : "Make:VW\n<br> Model:BUS\n<br> Colour:WHITE\n<br> Year:65\n<br> Engine size:2165cc\n<br> Fuel type:Petrol\n<br> Transmission:Manual\n<br> Mileage:3000klm\n<br> MOT:05/14\n<br> Tax:Free\n<br> Price:£22500\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Up for sale is my 65 bus that I have owned for over 6 years. In this time I have fully restored it and enjoyed every minute of it!\n<br> It was imported into the UK from Holland back in 2003 so its a LHD. It was a standard bus until I bought it then the modifying began. I sent it down to a company called Type2detectives to renew all mechanical components including slamming it with a big power engine being custom built to my requirements. After all the work was complete I used the bus for a good while before I decided to complete a bodywork resto on it. It took about 18 months before it was fully painted inside and out and turned out far better than I even imagined it too! After building it all back together I built a custom interior to suit our family needs then sent it away to be retrimmed. For the last 2 years we have used it for camping trips and showing at VW show all over the UK. It has won 5 trophies in this time and has been enjoyed by all the family! In January this year I had the engine and gearbox rebuilt by Matt Balls (ex T2D) so they have only covered 3000klms since then. He also fitted a propex heating system too.\n<br> Before the engine and box rebuild I used it for the odd Drag day where it ran constand 16's 1/4mile times so its a very quick bus and will easily keep up with most things on the road. For family camping I have fitted a RnR 3/4 bed in the back and a kids hammock in the front. It has a twin hob for cooking too. I built this bus to keep and never thought I'd sell it but that's has changed!!!! It has an independent agreed valuation of £28500 on it and including buying it all those years ago I have spent way more than £30k on it! I have a few extras that can be sold with the bus, thermo screens, Kyham quick erect awning etc.......RWC 598 will NOT be sold with the bus, I will reregister it for the new owner!\n<br> Full build thread here......... \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=44118\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=44118</a> Everything in there!\n<br> Here is a brief spec list of the bus...............\n<br> \n<br> BODYWORK:\n<br> Fully restored and painted by VW BUSLANE\n<br> Pearl white with Alpine white powdercoated trims\n<br> INTERIOR:\n<br> Fully retrimmed by CUBE interiors\n<br> \n<br> OUTBACK:\n<br> SA conversion\n<br> Pro comp gearbox built by BEARS Transmissions\n<br> Super diff\n<br> Titanium sideplates\n<br> Steel forks\n<br> Late clutch realease bearing\n<br> Welded 3rd and 4th\n<br> 3500rpm at 72MPH\n<br> Type 3 larger drum brakes and components\n<br> T2D Fully adj. extra toe springplates\n<br> \n<br> ENGINE:\n<br> 2165cc 3000klms on it\n<br> AS41 Supercase 94mm cleared and tapped for full flow\n<br> Chromoloy 78mm crank\n<br> CB straight cut cam gears\n<br> CB flywheel\n<br> Engle 110 cam\n<br> Chromoly pushrods\n<br> Mahle 94mm stroker\n<br> Jaycee pushrod tubes\n<br> Big valve heads\n<br> Kennedy stage 2 Clutch\n<br> Fully flowed oil system with midmounted fan assited cooler\n<br> CSP breather box\n<br> 44idf's carbs\n<br> A1 S/S side winder exhaust\n<br> \n<br> WHEELS N TYRES:\n<br> JGE radar\n<br> Bridgestone Potenza fronts\n<br> Yoko rears\n<br> \n<br> £22500\n<br> \n<br> Any question just ask?!?!?!?\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s294.photobucket.com/user/richierichie37/media/dubshed5_zps124bd08a.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm90/richierichie37/dubshed5_zps124bd08a.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s294.photobucket.com/user/richierichie37/media/dubshed9_zpsa9684514.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm90/richierichie37/dubshed9_zpsa9684514.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s294.photobucket.com/user/richierichie37/media/split/lowsplit5.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm90/richierichie37/split/lowsplit5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s294.photobucket.com/user/richierichie37/media/split/SVAG201219.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm90/richierichie37/split/SVAG201219.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s294.photobucket.com/user/richierichie37/media/split/SVAG201216.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i294.photobucket.com/albums/mm90/richierichie37/split/SVAG201216.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
