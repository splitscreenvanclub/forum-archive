    "content" : "Hi Guy's I have fitted a Scat gear shifter to my camper which is a late 1967 LHD split screen.\n<br> The first scat shifter that was tried did not work and we found out that they make 2 different length's so we tried the longer one. This works however we are having difficulty in finding 1st &amp; 2nd gears as the shifter moves to far to the left which makes it difficult to engage these gears.\n<br> There is a plate under the original gear stick which limites the movement, we tried this, it works as far as the 1st to 4th gears are all easier to find and engage but it will not go into reverse gear. We are not sure if it is the lips on this plate which help the original gear stick that are restricting the scat gear stick or that it just does not work with reverse with a plate beneath it. Any idea's !!\n<br> Thanks\n<br> Gazzy",

Got it working at last.\n<br> After contacting a few people and being advised to knock the shifter to the left as far as it would go and tighten down, I tried this and it worked better, so I filed the right hand side of the base plate holes for the bolts so that the shifter could move more to the left. After playing about for a bit with the file and ajusting, it now works perfectly and looks great.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks\n<br> Gazzy",
