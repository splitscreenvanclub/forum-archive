Preferably a late square end type (not an early curved one)\n<br>\n<br>I want to have something similar in my interior, with a sink/ hob combination, although size will be tight. I wont have the hanging clothes cupboard coming off it though, as the spare wheel well is in the back on that side.\n<br>Need length, width and height.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks for your help!",

    "content" : "Cutting edge technology - the back of an envelope! All measurements in mm\n<br>\n<br>This is a square fronted 65 cooker unit; have tried to be as accurate as possible, though some corners and angles are crumbling a bit which makes it hard to measure. \n<br>\n<br>Front is narrower at the top/bottom and bows out at the centre to follow contours of the bus.\n<br>The 363 inside is the measurement of the internal box frame ie the front width of the metal cooker housing\n<br>The 375 is the curved ply faceplate that is stuck on the front which sticks out beyond the metal housing to sit flush with the curved side of the bus - make sense? \n<br>\n<br>Have measured the metal cooker housing in the left elevation for you as this is the depth which I'm assuming will clear the wheel arch if you want internal shelving etc.\n<br>\n<br>The right elevation is the \"showing\" side that butts up against the rear seat back on the angle, the firewall and the cargo floor. I couldn't measure the angles, but they will again follow the contour of the bus. Note this side is slightly shorter than the other; it butts up against the seat back, whereas the metal holder is longer as it protrudes through a cutout in the seat back to rest on it for support. \n<br>\n<br>This is just the housing; there is a lid/table that sits on top which is slightly larger to the front and side, rounded off with the Devon aluminium trim for a dazzling finish.\n<br>\n<br>I would have taken photos for you and imposed the measurements on top but there is not enough room, sorry!",
