    "content" : "I seem to remember seeing that front pop out catches impinge on Devon wardrobes?\n<br>\n<br>Is there any way around this? How much does it catch by, could a modified catch be made? Is it different for early spoons vs late catches?\n<br>\n<br>My alternatives are:\n<br>\n<br>a. to fit the pop outs opening 'forwards' \n<br> - but I like the one I can reach from behind my head when I'm driving\n<br> - and I might catch my clothes on the catch when getting out of the cargo door\n<br> - and it might look a bit odd, although Sooty did this on his samba and it looked awesome\n<br>\n<br>b. to fit a 'fixed' pop out frame on the left hand side\n<br> - it will be visually inkeeping with the other five\n<br> - I will probably need to make some sort of catch to keep it closed but without hitting the wardrobe\n<br>\n<br>c. fit four fixed windows and two rear pop outs as per factory\n<br> - but I like the front ones for getting enough breeze through on a summer's day",

But at least I know something fits so I can leave the hinge in place before painting. \n<br>\n<br>Very helpful thank you",
