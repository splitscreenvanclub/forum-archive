    "content" : "So like this one below? It needs a good clean and paint. It is part of the bundle of tinware I’m selling (current advert on SSVC Facebook). If you didn’t want the dynamo and fan shroud from that add as they are bulky and heavy to post I can take out those two items and include the pieces above instead and the two heat pipes I have and everything else plus a few spares instead. I have it all in one box ready to go as I pacakaged it for someone yesterday but as they wanted it overseas the postage was too expensive (more than the cost of all the parts). I’m looking for £50 for the lot and I can courier it for £15. This has some twin and single port head tins and other tinware of various things included plus some of the little pieces I’ve found that go around the preheat pipes and a couple of dipsticks. Just want to get rid really. All needs a clean and possibly painting to make it good but at least you would have some spares. Let me know if interested. \n<br> \n<br> Steve\n<br> \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=41152&amp;sid=548ec9f135927739f0b676b68b1d5cd7&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=41152&amp;t=1&amp;sid=548ec9f135927739f0b676b68b1d5cd7\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"110B3936-E705-48C5-9AF8-4046B3053B83.jpeg\" title=\"110B3936-E705-48C5-9AF8-4046B3053B83.jpeg (108.03 KiB) Viewed 139 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
