    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>\n<br>Apologies for the crap photo's - they were taken from my phone...\n<br>\n<br>NOTE: The seats are from a bay. I don't know if they might fit a split?\n<br>\n<br>First up, LHD - believed to be from an early bay window kombi. There's one small tear near to the handle on the flip seat, and there is a paint spillage by the base of the flip seat (done by prev owner). It also has two aftermarket lap belts secured to a bar welded across the back. It doesn't have the rear handle or ashtray (sorry \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I needed them for my middle seat): \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">£30</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00391.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00393.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00392.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00394.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Next, a RHD microbus middle seat - maybe from a bay crossover as the handle on the flip seat is a different style. It will need a repair to the front, top leg (2nd leg from left), but nothing serious. There is an L-shaped tear on the front of the base, and the material on the outer corner of the flip seat has ripped. Again, rear handle is missing as was required for my middle seat. Ashtray is included: \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">£20</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00403.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00405.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00402.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00404.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00406.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00401.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Finally, a spare wheel cover (was from my old '71). Has the usual two cracks but otherwise fairly good condition: \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">£5 - SOLD (STP)</span>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00395.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00396.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w287/mcvwuk/For%20Sale/DSC00397.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>All the above are located in KT12, and due to size the seats would have to be collection only - unless you can arrange a courier? The spare wheel cover could be posted for about a tenner via senditnow or similar. \n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Open to offers/swaps on all as I want rid of them from my garage <img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"></span>\n<br>\n<br>Thank you,\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Mike",
