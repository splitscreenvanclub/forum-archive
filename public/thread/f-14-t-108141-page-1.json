After not having a porch on our house I built a temporary shelter till we saved up to build a 3m x 1m porch (no planning needed). \n<br>\n<br>So I built this....\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s249.photobucket.com/user/spikecrewcab/media/Mobile%20Uploads/F289D8E3-5B1E-4F88-B17A-F8D948CE3BF3_zpsmgcru3n0.png.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i249.photobucket.com/albums/gg224/spikecrewcab/Mobile%20Uploads/F289D8E3-5B1E-4F88-B17A-F8D948CE3BF3_zpsmgcru3n0.png\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>It's ok for now, but miraculously we got planning for this...\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s249.photobucket.com/user/spikecrewcab/media/Mobile%20Uploads/7EC843C0-E884-4BBA-B099-93EB3863B7A4_zps1nxueyam.png.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i249.photobucket.com/albums/gg224/spikecrewcab/Mobile%20Uploads/7EC843C0-E884-4BBA-B099-93EB3863B7A4_zps1nxueyam.png\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Which is great, but hence the sale of the School Bus.

My question is this..... Is there any good guides to starting foundations for something like this? I have googled porch (they seem to be too small) then single storey extension... But that's too much with building regs, insulating floors etc as all I have found on single storey extensions are classed as rooms. This will not be classed as a habital room as the existing outer door, window etc on the existing build will remain, there will be no radiator etc also...\n<br>\n<br>So I'm needing info on what the foundations need to be (depending on foundations under the house of course) so I can try and make some money back on the money I've spent on the bug!!! \n<br>\n<br>Any help or links would be great. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers.",

If you do then the building inspector will tell you exactly what you need, or should I say, what he wants. Don't be afraid to ask them, they're there to help.\n<br>\n<br>If you don't need building regs then as for foundations the golden rule I use is copy the house foundations. And as regards the slab etc then Ziggy is correct although I feel the 65mm floor screed is overkill and not needed. And to be exact the visqueen should go under the floor insulation and another layer of visqueen before the slab",
