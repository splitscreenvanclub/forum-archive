    "content" : "Hi all,\n<br>\n<br>I'm trying to identify some of the CSP disc kit components. I've had their 55-63 on my bus for around six years with no problem. MOT man says I need a new wheel bearing. I've pulled the outer one and it is a 32005X (Â£10 from simplybearings.co.uk), but I need to know the code on the inner plus the spindle seal dimensions.\n<br>\n<br>Anyone have a 55-63 kit that could givce me some codes and dimensions.\n<br>\n<br>btw, the calipers seems to be Vauxhall Cavalier 1.8 FWD with some machining mod.\n<br>\n<br>I can get the bits from CSP but I can get them cheaper over hear just down the road. I could pull the rotor and take a look but I like to get the parts in before I start a job.\n<br>\n<br>Any help appreciated \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Lee\n<br>\n<br>'57 samba",
