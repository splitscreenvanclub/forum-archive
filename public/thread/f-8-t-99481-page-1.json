Just got the underside sealed with a Waxoyl/underseal mix, while I'm away. Hopefully, this will protect through Winter, should I take it outside!\n<br> I (someone \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":idea:\" title=\"Idea\"> ) will be hitting it big time, once things settle down in Feb.\n<br> It's a good runner as it is, but my little boy only has eyes for the bling, so, although he was really excited at getting a splitty (he loves them), he was less than impressed with the patina look! Even the Porsche seats couldn't sway him! I was proper gutted!!\n<br> \n<br> I've been a biker all my life, but they can't involve my son, and would probably end up messy, so, time to move on... I've wanted a splitty for years, but other things kept getting in the way. Recently I saw this van and just knew this was my time \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br> The bus is our future \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> All about weekends, cruzing and holidays together, and when I've had enough, it'll be gifted to Aiden (number one son)...\n<br> Even the plate is ADY \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> I pointed that out to him, trying to get him to buy in to it, he just said, \"Aiden, daddy... DEN!\" \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> Kids, eh... He'll love it, when it's shiny.\n<br> \n<br> I'll be fitting Safari's, plus I'm going to replace my Jalousie's with pop-outs, all polished.\n<br> Not sure of the rear interior as yet, possibly go back to the 3/4 bed &amp; wardrobe, as we'll be kipping in an awning type tent (when I decide on which). The Porsche front seats will be reupholstered to match the rest... \n<br> Engine is getting bigger, too. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> Currently a very healthy 1641, twin carb, it will be replaced by a bigger lunmp, possibly turbo'd, too. \n<br> Was/am considering a RHD conversion.\n<br> Oh yes... One last thing... I'm going to SLAM it, as low as possible, without having to resort to tubbing!\n<br> All done in the Norwich area...\n<br> So excited thinking about it, again... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> \n<br> Wish I didn't have to work for a living \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\">",
