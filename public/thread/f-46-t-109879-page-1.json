    "content" : "Excuse my ignorance \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\"> but I've seen various pics of mid 60's Devon interiors, and often wondered what all the bits are for and how the interior 'works' in terms of converting to a bed etc.\n<br>\n<br>There seem to be two units that mount on the cargo doors, am I right in thinking the LHD one is for a wash bowl? If so, what's the one on the RHS for? Cooker/storage, or is this the taller upright unit? What's the unit for that goes to the side of the rear seat for?\n<br>\n<br>The door in the end of the rear facing buddy seat? Fridge/storage?\n<br>\n<br>Is the table top used to complete the bed, or is this a separate piece that gets stored in the rear overhead storage unit?\n<br>\n<br>Any pics or labeled diagrams would be helpful, or maybe a link to an Devon brochure?",
