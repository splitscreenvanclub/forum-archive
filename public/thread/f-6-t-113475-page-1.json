I need to change all 4. Never changed IRS before as always had swing axle. \n<br>\n<br>Whats my best appraoch here to get these buggers off?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",

    "content" : "Give each bolt a proper whack with hammer to break rust. Get a good pair of proper Mole grips with end teeth in good nick, then tighten them on to Allen screw heads as tight as you can. Then clean out the splines right down to the bottom. Insert spline wrench by tapping with hammer. Then undo using both the Mole grips and the spline wrench. Most of them will give up quite easily. If one or two just won't move I cut the heads off with angle grinder and remove the remaining piece with a stud remover after the joint is off. Good luck!",

From opposite bolt to bolt my camper cv holes measure 80mm. The boots jk sent me are 85mm? Which ones should i have ordered that are the slightly smaller ones?",

    "content" : "Errrm - this is a tad confusing. AFAIK there are two types of VW CV joints - beetle with OD = 94mm and bus OD = 100mm. There are also larger Porsche CV joints which were 108mm OD. I think Polo/Golf joints may be smaller so maybe that's what they sent you. How can you have a joint with OD = 80mm? \n<br>Jim is right about some CV joints - older bus joints 1968 - 1970 sometimes have a recess machined on one end - the end that mates with the box/hub. All replacements I've seen have a groove machined into the joint to mark the same end. \n<br>Edit - just seen that you measured bolt to bolt in which case you have beetle CV joints and you need beetle boots - they sent you bus boots!",
