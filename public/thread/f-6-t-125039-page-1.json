    "content" : "Hi all, I'm looking to tub my bus using Trailer Queen Tubs but in addition I'm looking to raise it slightly.\n<br> \n<br> It has flipped spindles and an adjustable beam but even at its highest point its pretty low, lower than the spindles alone should be, so probably saggy springs.\n<br> I also travel on ferries from time to time and have traded paint on he ramps of these, so I toyed with fitting adjustable coil overs then a friend mentioned the Monroe air shocks.\n<br> I know this will probably put extra load on the shock mounts but figure they'll take it.\n<br> I'm not looking to Bag it as I'm content with all aspects of driving it, just need something to raise it a wee bit without too much fettling.\n<br> \n<br> TIA\n<br> Brian",

    "content" : "I have the Monroe air shocks on the front. I put them on due to a steep drive and forever touching up the paint on the bumper. It only lifts a few inches but does the job. I originally had them on a cigarette lighter Socket powered tyre pump connected to a valve on the included air lines. I have since fitted a tank and control panel. I love the way it rides and is very practical for speed bumps etc. \n<br> Simon",
