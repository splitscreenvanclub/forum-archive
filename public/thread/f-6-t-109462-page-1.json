    "content" : "I'm putting the cargo floor back in. I've drilled the holes using a step drill bit to about 5 or 6mm I think. Cargo floor sits fine for an NOS panel. When I weld through the holes in the cargo floor all I'm getting is the welds popping \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\"> \n<br>\n<br>I cannot seem to get the welds to hold. I've tried increasing the current, dropping it, wire speed up and down etc but it keeps happening. The welds are literally not penetrating at all. It's almost like the welds just sits in the hole and on top of the top hat for example and isn't holding to the metal underneath.\n<br>\n<br>I'm kneeling along the drill hole lines and using my body weight to push the panel down tight to the support section. I've then been welding into the holes in a line. Is this right?\n<br>\n<br>Should I be welding for example on one end and then switch to the opposite end (same line though) so the heat doesn't build up? \n<br>\n<br>What is causing the welds to simply keep popping? Is it the heat? Maybe the holes are too small?\n<br>\n<br>HELP",

Did you use any primer or anything on the steel underneath? My advice would be to take it off and check the steel is super clean and then give it another go. \n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji106.png\">\n<img src=\"http://emoji.tapatalk-cdn.com/emoji106.png\">",

Good job I stopped and walked away from it. \n<br>\n<br>I guess a good idea would be to drill back through the welds I have done to mark the area that needs cleaning and then maybe use a permanent marker to the holes I haven't welded to again mark the area that needs cleaning?\n<br>\n<br>Don't want to needlessly clean the entire top hat or I beam I suppose.\n<br>\n<br>Either way the floor is coming out again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>Photos on my 67 velvet green post!",
