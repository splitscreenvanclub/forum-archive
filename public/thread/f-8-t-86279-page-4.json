The 996 weighs 200kg and the original flat 4 about 100kg so straight away the good old law of moments has 100kg extra hanging out the back. Add to this that i am removing the front torsion system which alone must weigh several tonnes (80kg) then the C of G may end up some where behind the bus! I do have the torque tube and front diff to counter this but in reality this will just replace the torsion stuff as a moment.\n<br> \n<br> I have started to do the datum figures and will post them when finished but i am not adverse to adding some weight up front to bring the C of G to a sensible position. With 300bhp on tap extra weight wont be a problem.\n<br> \n<br> The other element of all of this is that it is a VW camper and will be used for family holidays so it does not need porsche style handling but that said would be nice for the back end to stay behind the front in corners.",
