    "content" : "Dear All,\n<br> \n<br> have recently bought my bus and trying to understand some of the do's and dont's behind the technology. The engine is a 1600 TP with a 4 into 1 header for the exhaust connected by J tubes (as in no heat exchangers). Looking at the fan housing the cardboard tubing is still in place as if the original heating sytem were intact. Is this wise or even wortwhile? Would i be better off blanking off these tubes and forcing the air to take a different, and hopefully more beneficial in terms of cooling, path? \n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> GH",

    "content" : "Hi I was in the same dilemma as you I have a vintage speed exhaust running with j tubes, I used to have the outlets on the fan housing blocked off with blank off plugs ,but have now swapped back to letting the air just blow through the tin ware on to the header after reading an in-depth study a chap called jake rabby had posted on the samba.com . He carried out temperature readings on the heads while using the different methods . He found that if you blank off the horns on the fan housing with plugs it causes turbulence in the housing it's self leading to a lack of cooling to one side of the engine saying that it is more beneficial to leave it with the tubes on and let it vent under the tin ware. It says in his findings to gain the most cooling you should use the tubes conected to the housing with a plug in the end of them to which you drill a 40 mm hole in the centre this creates the same amount of back pressure that you would get if they were connected to heat exchangers. If I can find the article on the samba again I will post a link to it. \n<br> \n<br> Cheers Martin",

    "content" : "Blimey after reading through all of that lot it has scared me to death that the engine is going to overheat because of a lack of standard exhaust/system and heat exchangers! Well it seems that blocking off the fan shroud is not a good move so will forget that for the time being. Having read the article about the whole system it sees that the stock exhaust system is a masterpiece of design and shouldnt be messed with. Might have to buy me some heat exchangers after all.....",

    "content" : "Well VW's focus was more on reliability and economy than power. You can get a lot more power from these engines, but it's a bit if a balancing act. So as long as you are aware of the knock on consequences of any given change you can either try to design the consequences out, or be happy to live with them. \n<br> There are, undoubtedly, some experts out there, but personally I have neither the time or knowledge to feel I could improve on Vw's work.
