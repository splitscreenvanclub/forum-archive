I've strapped the vacuum line to the clutch and added a second brake switch and then moved all the old brake pipes (I put them on flexis last time because I knew I'd be fitting this servo at some point). The only serious problem was a misalignment of the pedal rod so I got my structural analysis colleagues to take a look at it and they say its okay to bend it. Dave P was a bit concerned because the last RHD he fitted it to didn't need this tweak so it may just be something to do with our bus??? \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/creativebrakeservo/P5290028.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/creativebrakeservo/P5290023.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k252/Bob_Corbishley/creativebrakeservo/P5290025.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

I have now bought another master cylinder and new switch, the problem I now have is that I have tightened it as much as I dare but it is leaking. Its as if it needs some sort of thread sealer or ptfe tape, is there a technique for installing it? I have screwed it in nearly all the way.\n<br>Any suggestions?\n<br>Also has anyone else has trouble fitting the under pan back on with the new cylinder? it doesn't seem to fit now\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Ady\n<br>\n<br>(I will also post this as a separate topic as its very urgent)",

The rod at the back of the servo is a bit small and pokes straight down the hole in the middle of the \"pushtube\" in the MC. The CE master cylinder is a Varga with CR3 embossed on the side and the T2D MC is also Varga with CR4 on the side. I'm tempted to jam a bit of bar in the end of the MC to make it work but I just know something else will go wrong. I've only wasted £17 on an Easibleed kit this morning that I didn't really need (it did make the testting and bleeding process a joy though!) and now I've got to spend another £50 on another master cylinder!",

CE have since changed the instructions to say that you should dummy the install up in the vehicle to work out how far outboard the servo can fit. The bar steps over by about 46mm but I designed it cock on obviously so nothing is stressed and no spherical bearings are required. My fatigue/mechanical analysis friends tell me there is no danger whatsoever of the bar doing anything unexpected. \n<br>\n<br>On a LHD install it steps over 24mm which is just doable with a straight rod.\n<br>\n<br>My heim is constantly stressed Steve but I dont think thats a topic for discussion on a public forum, I dont even talk to my closest friends about such things, its private.\n<br>\n<br>The beam is a CE ball joint bay beam and it did have a bracket already fitted but it was miles away from where the CE one needs to be. I did mock it up but it wouldn't work - cant remember why though. Bays must have very different pedal boxes.",
