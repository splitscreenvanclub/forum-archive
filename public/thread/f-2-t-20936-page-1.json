(I got him to stick his head out of the window and give me a thumbs up when it was safe...)\n<br> \n<br> Now I have loads of questions buzzing around in my heeed!\n<br> \n<br> Do I replace it with an elephant ear or go for small and round again?\n<br> Should I replace both with whatever style I go for?\n<br> \n<br> I just don't know...\n<br> \n<br> Your thoughts, comments and suggestions please!",
