    "content" : "Hi All\n<br>\n<br>I have recently developed Cup holders for the front of the van as I got fed up with having nowhere to put my can of coke/coffee on my travels, my wife usually holds our drinks but not good as she cant hold on to anything when I take a corner! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> \n<br>I've seen the cup holder that fixes through the dash from aircooled accessories which is nice but a bit big for me and even though you can unclip it you still have to store it somewhere.\n<br>\n<br>So, I get to the point!, I am interested in knowing if people would like to have these as they allow for two cups in the front that rotate and fold away when not in use keeping them out of sight, they are made of polished aluminium and although the ones in the picture show white cup inserts the new design will be Stainless steel, these inserts are also removable for cleaning and the cup holders rotate under friction so stay wherever you move them to!\n<br>\n<br>please take a look at the photos, be nice to hear your views as I will start manufacturing them if demand is there! (I recently developed the ashtray Iphone dock, which I only started after asking a similar question to everyone!) \n<br>\n<br>I would expect they will cost around Â£30 for a pair inc postage\n<br>\n<br>look forward to your feedback!",
