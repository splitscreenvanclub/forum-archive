I have only seen the black top with full sized lid in real life or in other photos. I wonder if it was changed based on early feedback or whether this was just to make the photos look better.\n<br>\n<br>Also single rear cupboard we have discussed before; not on the brochures but seen in [some] 62 buses.",

There have been some brochures for sale recently with excellent photos which I have \"stolen\" with pride..\n<br>I also bought two of them!\n<br>\n<br>I am adding Devon Brochures with dates (where they existed printed on the back or where dated by the AA). I am adding commentary and if others know differently please PM me and I will update.\n<br>I am attempting to make this a definitive guide to assist others to identify what model an interior came from.\n<br>I know I am sad ..... in that I have collected brochures for a while and where there are different dates of printing looked closely at the changes...some have spelling mistakes corrected and some have text revisions and photo changes.\n<br>I also have some Factory Press photographs ( pictures &amp; actual hard copies) which I will add \n<br>I have a few adverts which are easier to date because they have motor or Autocar dates in the page headings.\n<br>I have some reprints from publications which were sent ot by JP White to customers.\n<br>I have some electronic copies of extracts from reviews which I will add.\n<br>\n<br>If anyone has any additional brochures for the years loaded so far that I do not included it MAY be that I do not have them and I would be glad to add them...just PM me links and I will reply and add with acknowledgements.\n<br>\n<br>G",
