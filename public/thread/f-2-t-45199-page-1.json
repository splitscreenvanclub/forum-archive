They've since been informed about all the faults with it, but I don't think are too bothered, and would rather just get out there and use and enjoy it. I'm not sure where it came from, or where it was restored. Judging by the bits used maybe Thailand?? \n<br>Riva lives just down the road from them, I've dropped him a pm about this. I don't think they are on the forum.",
