Went out with the intention of sorting this lot out as I can't find anything at the mo ! \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/1eef9e027b48de19bfd03cdf83f036d6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>But got side tracked and welded new door seal bottom lips on the drivers side then decided to get the door to fit properly , bit of a task as it seems to have got a bit warped in the de skin / re skin. Anyway managed to get it sorted and stripped the old door lock off what was left of the inner part, it's in a bit of a mess and had to be drilled out with some new captive buts welded on the back \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/7053d3d3c095a84508d952f791abe71b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/5757c80cc5854c5f3c38ddb974ccc176.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Got it cleaned up and wd40 got it Moving again \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\"> come to fit it and realised I really shouldn't have used a later door to put the skin on as the lock is totally different ! Bit of bashing, fettling and re drilling some holes and it's kind of ok now, I still need to extend the hole where the catch protrudes as it's rubbing slightly. Then got into sorting this mess out, I've been dreading this ever since I did the other side ! \n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/6207034122fa086b67e7fce00c5ffc75.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/3dd148a0bd53ae7eec68523b8efee3ad.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/6380d789ede7f5ae30ea54df49f79bad.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Welded on a new thread for the bottom of the quarter light as both of these had rotted \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/1eb34e8ded246de42d47c20fc7f22e5b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Bashed out all the old rubber which took ages . New seals all round (which took even longer !!) and re fitted the door top, this caused me a whole load more pain in getting the door to close but with a lot of bending and adjusting its now closing quite nicely and has all the glass in ! Just need to get the door card fitted and that's sorted. Hopefully onto the master cylinder/ brake pedal and gear stick tomorrow which pretty much means the cab is finished \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/dab62da4fa49eecbd4472c4d1c575f19.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160218/d84e64d2f8e5694ef8a1a2467f6b7cb9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",
