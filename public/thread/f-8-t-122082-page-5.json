In my day used to be kept available to view in local library...traced an old \"friend\" that way ..but that is another story..\n<br> Census records may be another help but if they are able to be read is another issue..\n<br> Also planning permission for any changes on line with local council may have names of owners at recent times.\n<br> \n<br> Also wondered if other sources of Buckinghsmshire records were on line.\n<br> SC could have been bought in Aylesbury or Maidenhead main dealer..close to main road between the two..\n<br> \n<br> \n<br>",
