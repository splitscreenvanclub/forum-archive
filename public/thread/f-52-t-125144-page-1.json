    "content" : "So after 13 years of great service we are retiring our Khyam Motordome Awninig. The material is just wearing out and leaks from most seams, obviously we have replaced it with a newer motordome \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> So being eco I have stripped the material from the frame and salvaged as many parts as I can .So if there are parts you need to repair your Khyam's let me know. I am happy to split the pole set into individual parts. I also have a Khyam 3m x 3m groundsheet and a Motordome bedroom avaliable from the same awning. I have kept some of the dark blue material and have a spare repair kit too.",
