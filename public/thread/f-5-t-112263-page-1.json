    "content" : "Ah, many thanks for that henk. Those pics are magic mate. It will also let a lot of other members know what they are looking for when they purchase a walk through bus with no seats. There are, of course, the other type that just clip into \"U\" brackets and don't have any adjustment.\n<br>Many members have questions on the subject of what else you could use in place of the very rare and expensive walk through seats. Early bay seats aren't too bad as they are quite shallow but I've made some long trips in buses with higher seat bases and its a bit of a pain with your head rubbing the roof for a hundred miles!

    "content" : "A couple of years ago I bought a pair of walk through seats, all with new covers on them (for my 66 RHD bus), and they are in as new condition. So I was very pleased to find them. They cost me Â£500 but as I say, they are in really nice condition. They are the clip-in type.\n<br>The thing is, I would like the driver seat to have some adjustment on it, so I was thinking of buying the runners and searching for the seat.\n<br>So here I am, learning about walk through seats! If the standard adjustable driver seat will fit both buses, it may be easier than I thought.\n<br>\n<br>To add a bit to the \"alternative\" idea of using bay seats. If you aren't sitting at the correct height you may experience a bit of pain in the upper back and neck. I've had a bit of this and I can tell you, its not good when you are on a long drive.\n<br>\n<br>So, I have a driver seat for a RHD bus (the clip-in type) that I would like to change for an adjustable type seat.\n<br>Steve",
