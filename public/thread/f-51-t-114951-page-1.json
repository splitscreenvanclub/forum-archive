    "content" : "With a heavy heart I am selling our 1954 van.\n<br>\n<br>The bus is totally standard. LHD German van, this van was lighty restored in the 1980's . Has all original sills, inner and outer, the only repairs done metal wise are 2 lower rear corners, the front lower dog legs have been let in and 1 small patch on cab floor, and that is it! \n<br>\n<br>Has a simple camping interior that we have used as a family. Original running gear and matching numbers except for engine. Running 30HP engine, has original starter handle. Comes with spares to keep you going / 'service' as never intended to sell. Have German paperwork, we believe it was a German police chief personal vehicle. \n<br>\n<br>My idea was to use and then restore to very high standard. Not an early bus but will not find many like this! \n<br>\n<br>£50k, sensible offers considered.",
