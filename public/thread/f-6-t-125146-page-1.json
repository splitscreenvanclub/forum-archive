    "content" : "Hi everyone,\n<br> Picked up my first Split only broke down 3 times on the way home and can't start at all how. It sometimes starts but stalls within a minute or two, it even did this while hot an hour or two into the drive home a strong smell of fuel everytime. I have bought a rebuild kit but this Solex H30/31 carb is a bit of a mistery what is this lever for and should if be floppy, is there supposed to be a spring here?\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for your help.",

    "content" : "Looks like a stock H30/31 - the lever is fine. Most likely the needle valve in the float camber is not closing properly, possible due to crud in the fuel lines. Renew the fuel hoses, check the needle valve and remove and clean the idle jet which could also be blocked.\n<br> \n<br> And get rid of that useless pancake air filter. Put a proper original filter back on the bus with a hose from that to the case oil filler otherwise you will always have oil leaks due to high case pressure.",
