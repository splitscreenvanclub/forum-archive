    "content" : "OK - everyone likes a bus with a name, and it didn't take long to christen this the Helicopter bus for reasons which will become obvious.\n<br>so it is a pretty original Caravelle camper conversion based on a 65 panel. I am not sure if these conversions were home kits or factory, or even franchised fitments, but it has survived the test of time relatively well - infact apart from a wobbly cupboard it is pretty nice in there (if a little spartan)\n<br>\n<br>The bus itself has covered 45000miles ! - well, the overall condition would suggest this to be true... if however it has covered 145000 then they must have been pretty easy miles. I am undecided which number is the most probable - the dash condition, clearness of the dials, condition of the door pillars, the way the doors shut etc all leave me leaning toward the lower figure. I guess it does not really matter too much as the bus needs a bit of love regardless.\n<br>\n<br>it is pretty straight, runs well and drives nicely - the brakes could benefit from a check over as a matter of course, and I would service the vehicle properly before embarking on a trans European adventure. \n<br>\n<br>Welding wise it would benefit from the short outer sill under the cargo doors being replaced - and the long sill has some bubbling so that would really need doing as well as a dinted outrigger (rear one) which has allowed moisture in as a result. It has a dint to the long side that would be easier to deal with when replacing the sill so worth the effort. Rear arches are simple to sort out, but to the credit of whoever cut them, have been done properly and very professionally. It leads me to believe the same professional fitted the helicopter roof panels, as they are not the work of some home bodger.\n<br>The doors, floors, corners and other areas are very good , and apart from a very low dint to the front panel / valence , and the aforementioned poke in the side it has evaded the attention of wayward Chryslers and Buicks for 50 years.\n<br>\n<br>The bus has seen one repaint in the original colour - some panels seem to have been painted , others not - and it is hard to tell, which suggests the paint is good, or I am rubbish at detective work. Filler wise the only area I have found is on the top of the front panel close to the central screen divider. it looks like the bus may have had a shallow pressure dint there many moons ago , and possibly that led to the repaint?\n<br>\n<br>The contentious roof panels are a love em /hate em thing - they have been fitted very well, and are pretty cool to sit under. I would think twice before reverting to a stock roof as they certainly add a degree of uniqueness to the bus.\n<br>\n<br>I really like this bus, it is a survivor and displays some areas of amazing originality which as mentioned leave me questioning the mileage - it needs a bit of love and affection, but is not too taxing or time consuming. \n<br>\n<br>the bus is in Compton Surrey and is Â£13K\n<br>\n<br>07974579667 OR 01483 810756\n<br>mail \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:steve@vwretro.net\">steve@vwretro.net</a>\n<!-- e -->\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20228_zpshhtyhde9.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20228_zpshhtyhde9.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20210_zpsrrybc7s1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20210_zpsrrybc7s1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20204_zps5ervwaw7.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20204_zps5ervwaw7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20199_zpsdzipsxwb.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20199_zpsdzipsxwb.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20205_zpsydfd8hdi.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20205_zpsydfd8hdi.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20209_zpsibskoxcz.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20209_zpsibskoxcz.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20214_zpsyawl6hyi.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20214_zpsyawl6hyi.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20215_zpsejijtjvk.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20215_zpsejijtjvk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20226_zpsenrotwjt.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20226_zpsenrotwjt.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://smg.photobucket.com/user/vwretrosteve/media/i%20phone%206%20230_zpstuuhczq1.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/vwretrosteve/i%20phone%206%20230_zpstuuhczq1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>",
