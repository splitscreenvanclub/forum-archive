    "content" : "The wife surprised me this morning...Oh err...no not like that, she suggested getting rid of our car and buying something along the lines of a\n<br> T4 / 5 SWB. \n<br>This ( as mentioned ) is to replace our car, and to be used as a daily driver etc etc.\n<br>\n<br>Now I don't know a lot about T4/ 5' s other than for what we want to spend , aprox 3 or 4 k we are looking at a High mileage van.\n<br>I have added T5 if a knackered but repairable came up cheap enough.\n<br>\n<br>We would be happy to buy maybe a non runner project or something is a running but needs on going work to get it to where we want to be. \n<br>So what are the pros...or I guess really the cons of a T4 /5, what are they like to work on, in particularly the engines.\n<br>\n<br>Was thinking about a basic van and fitting windows ? \n<br>\n<br>Thoughts and input much appreciated \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br>\n<br>Andy",

    "content" : "I had a T4 as a daily for quite a while and they are great in my opinion. We had a 2.5tdi caravelle, modified obviously, but it was great. I did the cam-belt when we got it, and other than servicing regularly if purred along lovely! Electric windows played up a bit, and the central locking stopped working for a while, but all easy to fix and parts are readily available. \n<br>\n<br>Driving it daily really wasn't an issue at all, it was my wife's for about 9 months and she ferried the kids about everywhere and used it for all of her day to day journeys in that time with no issues whatsoever. \n<br>\n<br>Economy wise, it wasn't standard but we got about 30mpg combined I would say. They aren't quick so you tend to become a little more relaxed overall, (she had an S3 before this and averaged 19mpg, her right foot isnt light!!). \n<br>\n<br>From our personal experience we had a great time with the van, and we all miss having it as a daily. We sold it as we were moving house and needed the money, regret it though as we now have an MPV instead, rubbish [emoji22][emoji22].",

The later models have newer gauges, 3rd brake light and possibly ABS and airbag on steering wheel. Aircon makes a difference to prices as well. All stuff thats normal on a t5 I guess. We get mid 30's on a long run and if you're gentle we get almost 40mpg. Loads of carry space and wife loves it, she even prefers the T4 over my passat for short trips.",

She's done 220k and still starts on the button. The main thing to look out for on the 1.9 is the cam belt the bottom main pulley has a small key way that can give and take out everything but that's about it cheap cheerfully and reliable. \n<br>\n<br>The 2.5 later models are going for big money now and are a complicated engine thus why vw only make the latter 1.9 on their t5. I'd go down the route of any of them but they will and can cost you lots especially when you start to customise which you will. \n<br>\n<br>Get on the t4 forum I enjoyed my experience there but now coming back to the Splitty once I've rebuilt the engine and box. \n<br>\n<br>Buzzers\n<br>\n<br>Ps \n<br>\n<br>Easy to board out carpet and window them to any advice just ask.",
