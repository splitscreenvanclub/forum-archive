They look like VW Heritage part number 211-611-021/AA which is listed on their site as the one to use with the conversion kit ?? I Have 2 independant brake lines to the front drums and and a singular line to the rear that tees off to each drum, stock splitty drums front (early with a total of 4 wheel cylinders) and split drums rear with a single wheel cylinder each drum, anyone have experience of different kits, seems the pin that actuates it all is too long in one set up and too short in another ?? Anyone experience of this ? or is it best to custom some other idea as this all seems a bit vague to me...or should that read confusing, just want to order the right parts !!!\n<br>\n<br>On the reservoir front i found a Fiat Panda one worked just fine, plenty of them in scrappers ........... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">\n<br>\n<br>CHEERS for any advice \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">",
