It's the mounting points I'm interested in as I'm struggling to fit the bed which I've had for years. Maybe LHD and RHD are different and mines not LHD but without something to compare it's difficult to know. Are the fittings for early and late buses all the same.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks",

And off you go, he does supply a plate to bolt onto rivnuts for the firewall because access around the fuel tank is tricky, pah!! just use a coupe of socket extensions. \n<br>I was a bit perplexed at first, but its a doddle",
