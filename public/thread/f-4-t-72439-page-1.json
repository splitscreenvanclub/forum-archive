Discount depends on the eventual number of units included in on the purchase. So to keep things simple, will run it like previous bulk buys. Everyone pays normal price then get the appropriate discount refunded once the deal is closed. From memory I think the refunds / discount was around Â£50 per unit.\n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/cat_334914-Fire-Suppression-Systems.html\">http://www.vwjim.co.uk/ourshop/cat_3349 ... stems.html</a>\n<!-- m -->",
