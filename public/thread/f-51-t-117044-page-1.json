    "content" : "I can't quite believe I am writing this but after 9 wonderful years the time has come to sell my beloved \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">1966 VW 11 Window Splitscreen</span></span>.\n<br>\n<br>The bus was first registered in Sweden in 1966 and imported into the UK in March 2005. I purchased the bus in June 2007.\n<br>\n<br>Over the last 9 years I have \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">sympathetically upgraded </span></span>the bus whilst maintaining a lot of its original characteristics, resulting in a bus that looks very classic in appearance but underneath has been significantly upgraded. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"> It really is a lovely example and very practical</span></span>.\n<br>\n<br>It is a \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">very solid and straight bus </span></span>(see pics) and over the years no expense has been spared upgrading and maintaining it. I have \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">invested over £18,000 during my ownership</span></span> (with over £16,000 in receipts).\n<br>\n<br>Overview of the specification:-\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Mechanical</span></span>\n<br>\n<br>- 2007cc Engine (1776 case with 78mm Crank and 90.5 Barrel &amp; Piston)\n<br>- Engle 110 Camshaft\n<br>- Dual Weber 40 IDF Carbs\n<br>- Pertronix Electronic Ignition with Flamethrower Coil and Ignition Leads\n<br>- Stainless Steel 4 into 1 High Performance Exhaust wth J tubes\n<br>- Straight Axle Conversion (Bus Boys with Beetle Gearbox)\n<br>- Front Beam with Foxsy adjuster\n<br>- SCAT large reinforced oil sump\n<br>- CSP Front Disc Brakes Conversion\n<br>- King Pins replaced\n<br>- Fully reconditioned steering box\n<br>- Bespoke Towbar\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Interior</span></span>\n<br>\n<br>- Full camping interior (originally from Busfurniture.co.uk) made from high grade marine ply\n<br>- Includes table and converts to full length bed\n<br>- Side unit includes 2 ring cooker with grill and single sink\n<br>- Upholstery by Trimming Tonic\n<br>- High grade ply roof\n<br>- Rear roof locker/shelf\n<br>- 2 x Rear Pop-out Windows\n<br>- 3 point Front Seat Belts\n<br>- Entire floor and over engine bay covered in DYNAMAT (best sound deadener on the market) significantly reducing engine noise, and improving performance of entertainment system\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Full Entertainment System</span></span>\n<br>\n<br>- Alpine iPod compatible head unit\n<br>- Alpine drop down TV / DVD player\n<br>- Alpine TV Tuner\n<br>- Infinity speaker system including Front Door speakers, Rear speakers and Subwoofer\n<br>- Full split charging system in engine compartment\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Chassis/Bodywork</span></span>\n<br>\n<br>- In the last year I have had the outer and inner sills replaced on both sides, and resprayed.\n<br>- Prior to that back in 2008 I had the chassis/fully fully checked with some sections being completely replaced or repaired (including cab floor, centre chassis section and an outrigger)\n<br>- The bodywork is not concours but is good with no corrosion, as I've always had things sorted as they come up.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>As you can see an impressive spec. \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">All mechanical work has been carried out by local Classic VW Specialists </span></span>who have spent their entire lives working on these beautiful things. All work has been completed to a high standard. The engine alone cost almost £5,000 and gives a fantastic drive with power readily available when you need it. The bus will happily cruise at 75mph and with its power has good acceleration even on uphill stretches.\n<br>\n<br>Overall genuinely a lovely bus that will give the new owner lots of fun, and create lots of fantastic memories. It's not a concours and I'm not selling as this - it needs a home where it will be used and enjoyed. It's also a real headturner because whilst it isn't 'stock' it has all those classic features that make the original buses so distinctive.\n<br>\n<br>Full MOT until May 2017.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">£32,500 ovno</span></span>.\n<br>\n<br>If you have any questions or would like to arrange a viewing please contact me.\n<br>\n<br>But please \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">NO TIMEWASTERS </span>- I know what the bus is worth and won't be letting it go on the cheap!!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Thank you for reading.",
