    "content" : "I have been looking on how to do this for a 1/3 + 2/3 front seat division bus. Front seat belts ......there is detail on the technical site...\n<br>You could fit period looking lap belts or three point belts. There is detail on fitting the upper mounting inside the B post. The lower mounting goes in the corner of the wheel tub by the bottom of the B post. The other part of the belt needs to be mounted in the floor at the front of the wheel tub well. There is a flat area but you will need reinforcemnt under the bus and a long belt to get up and in between the seats. I have lots of period photos...\n<br>But your bus is a 1961? or a 62?\n<br>With a bench seat?\n<br>At this time the beetles and buses sold in USA had M24 retaining bolts and anchorage points...\n<br>I have pictures of the mountings in bus floors and on the wheel tubs for lap belts",

Otherwise in an impact the effect of the forwards inertia translate onto a downwards crushing force. Thus the best place is to follow the advise in the technical thread on putting a reinforcement plate inside the B post. I did find someone who sold them...thought it was Machine7 ......but cannot see them now..... That is what I will do. Your requirements may be better with statics mounted this way?",
