Hopefully the adaptors will only come to a few more £s than the cost of R9D machining charge to use the early bay spindle (which would be needed if you were to carryover splitty brakes) so by the time you've bought a pair of second hand boxster calipers(£150) and a pair of new disks (£80) it will be a very cost effective installation.\n<br> \n<br> Sadly Elrao's bus is more oxide than steel so I may have to test it out on my crewcab!\n<br> \n<br> 5 weeks wait for our kit now.",
