You can probably buy these from creative. \n<br>\n<br>Shalom, Lee.",

    "content" : "Ok. So finally got myself organised and got my table made up to hold the gearbox while i routered off the 15mm. \n<br>\n<br>Turn your G'box upside down and trace 'round the outline of your bellhousing. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/3AD96C21-1E94-4D21-A019-E92F85483118-2791-000002293F0EA119_zpscef0067b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Then jigsaw out the hole and turn the wooden sheet upside upside down, facing down and put some sturdy legs on it. \n<br>NOTE: Make them MORE sturdy than what you see here.

Just LOTS of swarf\n<br>I filled up the bellhousing with rags. \n<br>Swarf gets everywhere. \n<br>This is after the first \"pass\" with the router. \n<br>Take your time. And I only cut 3mm at a time. \n<br>The gearbox material is tougher than I thought. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/A6164EF9-3FDC-475F-8B11-ADD728DFDDA5-2791-0000022C0B8B5E58_zps71e965d5.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Ok. All done. \n<br>It took a good while. \n<br>Maybe an hour solid. \n<br>Going slowly and making sure the bit didn't get too hot. \n<br>I didn't use any coolant. Maybe I should have. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/DBFC6BF0-8F44-49CD-BFA6-0BADEC8E156A-2791-0000022C7C0F2066_zps28227f80.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The gearbox minus 15 mm. \n<br>Ready to,bolt to your already mounted adapter plate. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/492E43DA-A3CB-4BCE-8EE4-3C7C6E745565-2791-0000022CA662BC4A_zps900c0dbf.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>If you notice. There are two sections cut off the circumference of the bellhoising. \n<br>One was where the oil filter was fouling the new position of the starter recess on the gearbox. \n<br>As this wasn't going to be used(starter stays on opposite side, bolted from engine side) I chopped it off prior to routering. \n<br>Two, the position where the G'box sits now, rotated has no recess for starter. \n<br>So I cut a section off the gearbox to allow it to fit. \n<br>I will try to plate up these somehow. \n<br>\n<br>I would however like to point out. \n<br>The plywood sheet I used as my \"table top\" was far too thin and flexible. \n<br>A section of kitchen counter top was used by Sid over on the brickyard. \n<br>And now I know why. No flex as you router. \n<br>\n<br>Also when you have the gearbox in place under your makeshift table/jig. \n<br>And flush with the top of the table. \n<br>I would screw blocks of wood on the underside of the table, tight to the side of the gearbox, to keep the gearbox in position. \n<br>As. When you get down to the last few mm. \n<br>The box will want to move as you pass the router over it. \n<br>Maybe this is obvious to some people. I\n<br> just said I'd point it out.\n<br>\n<br>Now it's not all plain sailing. \n<br>I need to come up with a way of gettin one or two more bolts onto the gearbox to bolt it to the adapter plate. \n<br>If you look to the right of the red line. There are plenty of holes. \n<br>If you look to the left of the red line. There are three red arrows. These holes are threaded and are not very big. Also they are enclosed. So maybe I will open them up and put a stud through adapter plate from engine side and try to get a nut in there from gearbox side somehow. \n<br>You will agree it's a big area not to have at least one bolt. Half of the circumference is say. \n<br>More head scratching. \n<br>Times like this I wonder if I should've opted for the cut and shut method as adopted by \n<br>BusBoy on the brickyard also. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h214/splitbusvanatic/ee5e2c07a978b9db4979c30c458ded1c_zps2a6dfa71.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
