    "content" : "Well here go's i didn't think i would be advertising this so soon but family unfortunately comes first! \n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s7.photobucket.com/user/SAMBA231965/media/Mobile%20Uploads/26639C46-AAC2-4AE5-9551-933265CAD6E6.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y279/SAMBA231965/Mobile%20Uploads/26639C46-AAC2-4AE5-9551-933265CAD6E6.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>and i need to sell the bus to fund care, Saying that i won't be letting it go cheap either \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>I have copied and changed a few things from Sootys original sales thread\n<br>\n<br>The bus i'm selling is an Australian RHD 11 window Semaphored Kombi that was imported about 4yrs ago and came into my possession last year. The underside was totally overhauled and new sills were added and blended, jacking points and a small section of floor. Other than that the bus is amazingly solid and has been treated to clear rust preventative. \n<br>\n<br>It has a very strong 1600cc on twin 40's that has just been tuned and runs spot on. It has been straight axled and the gearbox and parts have all been refurbished. \n<br>\n<br>It is tubbed at the front and has a steering box raise. \n<br>\n<br>New Safari windows front and rear (aged to match the bus) (Buttys Seals Fitted)\n<br>\n<br>6 new pop out windows (aged to match the bus) (i have one new bare frame and hinge as the front o/s hinge has come away from the body. Held on with one spot weld)\n<br>\n<br>The front fogs are wired up to the Semaphores so flash on turning. (Semaphores now flash, Rear lights are all super bright led's in custom pods \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> needs wiring finishing)\n<br>\n<br>The ENTIRE floor and sides are totally covered in Dynamat which stops vibrations and noise dramatically. \n<br>\n<br>Inside is a hand made wooden interior with grey seats to match the hubcaps. The table goes between the seats to form a huge bed. Has 2 cooker points. one on the door and one inside. Loads of storage under all the seats. the rear cupboards need re-installing as removed for sound deadening.\n<br>\n<br>The previous owner mounted a Propex heater in the spare wheel well which is piped to the rear facing seat so heats the rear, and he also piped it under the cab (insulated) and it runs up the heater vent so puts really hot air onto your feet or windows! \n<br>\n<br>It has a Gene Berg shifter. \n<br>\n<br>New Hurst (Boz) Bar (aged to match the bus) \n<br>\n<br>'Buttys' throttle linkage \n<br>\n<br>Leisure battery and split charger \n<br>\n<br>100 watt Large Solar panel to be mounted to the roof rack and controller in with the sale (Great for camping as free power while camping\n<br>\n<br>Anti theft fuel cut off solenoid \n<br>\n<br>Skytag tracker device fitted can be transfered to the new owner\n<br>\n<br>Stainless steel exhaust \n<br>\n<br>Repro rear bumper hangers correct to year in with the sale\n<br>\n<br>Ladder and roofrack (roofrack welded to gutter as I hated the look of clamps! but will easily grind off without damaging the gutters) \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The price is a tricky one as there aren't many solid early ribbed RHD busses around so after scanning forums and noticing another later LHD logo'd bus for a certain price, I have based it on that. The price is of course negotiable as the building quotes are coming in.... but i'm not going to listen to silly low ball offers. \n<br>\n<br>THE BAD POINTS. \n<br>\n<br>The O/S Front pop out hinge has come away from the body and is held on with one spot weld but as i said there is a spare frame and hinge in with the sale.\n<br>\n<br>The roof has part Damplifier pro installed for quieter nights sleep and driving. Spare box in with the sale\n<br>\n<br>No stereo (apart from speakers in the overhead locker) (I-Phone dock in the ashtray just need the apple lead for the tray)\n<br>\n<br>Rear brake light wiring needs finishing. (May have finished it by time it has sold)\n<br>\n<br>The interior could do with a varnish as its still plain wood. \n<br>\n<br>It is tax and MOT free \n<br>\n<br>Im in no mad rush to sell as im only selling to fund my Grans Care bills.\n<br>\n<br>Â£30,000 Please PM me if interested and for Photos\n<br>\n<br>Thank You",
