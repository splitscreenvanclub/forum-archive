    "content" : "Hi\n<br> I am fitting a doghouse fan shroud for 1600 twin port. (1965 split screens) On the back there are two extra pieces to close off the oil cooler. One goes on the open side of the cooler and mates to the back of the shroud so totally closing off the cooler. The second piece goes on the bottom of the first piece and sticks out at 45 degrees- so ends inline with the side of the flywheel.- \n<br> Question is, can I now access the top bolt on my bell housing when fitting the engine? Looks like no to me\n<br> Would it matter if I did not fit this piece.?\n<br> \n<br> I,lltry upload a photo\n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"thumbnail\"> \n  <dt>\n   <a href=\"./download/file.php?id=33562&amp;sid=f12d19783a8f78552f18318f556e4949&amp;mode=view\"><img src=\"./download/file.php?id=33562&amp;t=1&amp;sid=f12d19783a8f78552f18318f556e4949\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"image.jpg\" title=\"image.jpg (207.75 KiB) Viewed 1804 times\"></a>\n  </dt> \n </dl> \n</div>",
