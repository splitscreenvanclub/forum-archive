    "content" : "Hi all..\n<br> \n<br> Im just doing a bit of armchair shopping for my winter engine project, I want to use Jic Fuel fittings through out from the tank to the twin 44's, Would anyone that has done this, would they have a list of the fittings needed and rough dimensions of sizes? I've got a 2276 with rotary fuel pump so far and a set of weber 44 idfs, I've got lots of r9 and r6 around but wanted to use the ptfe and ideally black fittings if anyone has a link...\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> thanks \n<br> \n<br> J",

    "content" : "look on torques website everything you need is there, its a custom fitting exercise so each system is different, for instance I use AN-8 Teflon hose for EFi so you just match the fitting size to suit the size hose you use, at a guess for carbs/low pressure fuel lines I would use AN-6 hose and fittings but I would do a bit of research or match the internal size of your existing hose to the AN/JIC size.",
