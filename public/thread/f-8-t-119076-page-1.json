A 1962 LHD - made it all of a couple of miles before the accelerator went (the throttle cable slipped out), an hour or so later it got it off the dual carriageway &amp; tightened the grub screw, from then on was a fab drive home. I've got another classic which is very different, felt weird watching the world pass you by on the motorway\n<br> \n<br> Lots of plans to personalise it (paint, trim, interior...) &amp; just a general tidy up, so I'm sure I'll be keeping an eye on threads &amp; asking stupid questions\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/cdqXEuj.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jBWMMV0.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/m1Tb7Ds.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
