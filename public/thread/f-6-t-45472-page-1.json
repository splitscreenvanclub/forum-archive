    "content" : "<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\"> Having refitted my gearlever, shift rods and couplings and new bushes i noticed i could slightly raise my front end by a notch on the keeper plates. \n<br> \n<br>I undone the big nuts, slightly eased of the allen bolts and lo and behold the keeper plates released from the tracks but lo and behold nothing !! \n<br> \n<br>The bus is up in the air on axle stands the wheels hanging in the arches, so why can't i move the leaves to a position that i want ? It looks like they are maybe jammed ? I put a jack under one wheel and slighty forced it up but the allen bolt did not move ? It looks like i will have to remove the king pins, spindles etc till i get to the trailing arms, i'm then hoping that wiggling these up and down will free things up, any help on this matter would be appreciated, thanks, Gary \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_question.gif\" alt=\":?:\" title=\"Question\"> \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif\" alt=\":twisted:\" title=\"Twisted Evil\">",

I've done the tapping think twice and it did work. Yes the extra wheel weight will help but only when raising the bus.",
