I'll try and work out what measurements are required so you can weld the plates in. Seats are secured by a bracket that loops over the legs/feet of the seat. The bolt that secures the bracket has a sort of anvil look so it slots in the round hole then slides up the channel. You then slip the bracket over the bolt and the arched bit of the bracket over the leg of the seat and use the wing nut to tighten it all down. I'm guessing you don't have the bolts n brackets or you may have worked it all out ?\n<br>\n<br>Confused ..............you will be \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
