    "content" : "Hello,\n<br>New to the forum and have my heart set on a Caravette or very similar low light model as I love the original interior and pop top versions.... Can find one around for love or money and absolutely gutted I missed the one sold the other week.. There's one on carandclassic but quite frankly the price doesn't reflect the reality of the condition....\n<br>\n<br>Anyone know of one for sale? I'm not a car dealer, just really love that look of them. I'm specifically looking for a neear to original caravette, low light with a pop top so a somewhat narrow field of search!!! \n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>Jackie",
