    "content" : "Soooooooooo.....\n<br>I ventured into the garage at the weekend having not really had any interest I've the last few weeks other than starting it up. Thought I'd cheer myself up with one of my wacky ideas \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>Whenever I'm working in the garage I end up stinking of exhaust fumes and feeling a bit sick as I have to reverse in due to the angle of the garage. So I have a brainwave. I I could connect a piece of long-ish pipe to the exhaust (I know what you're thinking but things ain't quite that bad yet \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> ) then vent it out through the garage wall then I could work on it wih the engine running with no problems. So I bought myself 25 metres of hose and some rubber pipe to step up the diameter and proceeded to find a suitable bit of garage to poke it through. Found a nice little gap up near the roof and then spent half hour looping the rest around the top of the wall and amongst all the random cr@p I have hanging up. Job done I poked the end into the pipe I was using to step it up and shoved that into the neck of a plastic bottle and secured it. Pushes the bottle over the end of the exhaust and fastened it nice and tight with a monster size cable tie. Started the engine and..........\n<br>\n<br>Yup, you guessed it.......nearly blasted a hole in my surfboard when the bottle flew off the end and went whizzing across the garage \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\":lol:\" title=\"LOL\"> Despite various attempts to secure it to the exhaust I gave up in the end \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>I might put my coat hooks in next weekend to cheer me up a bit as theres not much that can go wrong there.
