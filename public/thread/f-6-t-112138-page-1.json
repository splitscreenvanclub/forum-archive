Here doesn't appear to be an earth connection on the motor which suggests that it earths through the chassis, so make sure you have the motor earthed.\n<br> \n<br> The park function works with two live feeds if I remember correctly, one to operate the motor when you pull the switch out and then a second feed to park the arms when you push it in. If you're incorrectly wired up then you'll never get it right !\n<br> \n<br> Not sure how compatible a Bug motor is but Google Don West in the U.S. And he'll sort it all out for you ! \n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> Jonny",

The one that Don West has for sale has already been converted and the price reflects this, and despite what one reads on the internet ,the Wolfsburg West armature doesn't fit the '65 only SWF motor without modification - it's about 10mm too long.\n<br> \n<br> I'm not sure why you advise against the beetle motor, apart from my current(no pun intended) wiring issues it's actually working rather well - It cost peanuts, it physically fits the frame without modification and all I had to do was to relocate the spindle that drives the actuating arms.",

    "content" : "Well best of luck..\n<br> AFAIK the Beetle motor arm throw is totally different..so you will have lots and lots of fun trying to get it to work with the correct sweep.\n<br> I had a Bay window motor fitted to my September 1964 and I spoke to several, read, researched and bought a refurbished frame and NOS motor and spindles from wiperman and fitted it. The 1965 switch means it self parks.\n<br> Overall it was cheaper than buying an unconverted OG unit from Wales.\n<br> I am more than happy..\n<br> Good luck with your efforts..\n<br> Every day is a school day...I look forwards to hearing how you get on..\n<br> BJ1 maybe will help he has converted the arms on beetle wipers and volvo I believe..\n<br> Good Luck",

In order to self-park, the switch needs to 'toggle' the power to terminal 54 to operate the self park circuit. My switch is just a simple on/off, so I've just wired it inline to terminal 54d. Not an ideal solution but it'll do until I throw some more money at it.",
