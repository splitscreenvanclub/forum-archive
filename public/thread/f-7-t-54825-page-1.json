Went to standford hall and looked at lots of splits, I fell in love with the metal curtain rails that go above and below each individual window with the curtains on either side. So cute!! I want some to put my curtains on. They look so much better than a rail or rope. Please help!! What are they called, Where do I get them from!!! Looked in C&amp;C and Schofields and just dont know what they are called so I can buy some, or where to find them. \n<br>\n<br>Please help me find some for my 11 window split.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks C",
