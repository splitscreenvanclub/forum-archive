    "content" : "Cheers very much Gents, make me blush \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br>I know how lucky i am to now own such an early logo van. The repaired chassis i hope to be even better than the 52 one as i have the ability to go back on my words \"if i did it again i would have done this \", cos now i am. \n<br> That Gerson panel is a way too nice to weld in -that wants hanging on the wall. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>I would imagine i dont need all that as the bulkhead upright is fairly good, it needs some work but i can fix it. The tubs and lower edge panel may be a different kettle of fish. \n<br>Still all that is a long way off as i have to build/repair the chassis to actually have the body to fit on. \n<br> \n<br>Chris - Here's one taken on the way back, all done with mirrors, correct side of the road and everything Dai. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/van.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br>and another of the door logo a bit closer up, sat on 15's but i do have the 2 original rivited 16's. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/van1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>I must just say again that the removal of the van was done by two Gents i met at the weekend and if it wasnt for them being determined enough to do the huge job of removing the van then i would not have had the oportunity to even have a chance of fixing it. Not only that but it was located a long way from where they live too. \n<br>Here is a tiny video they took which gives a bit of insight into there huge mamouth efforts to save the van from the woods, makes collecting it feel easy (badly edited by me \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">, i hope they dont mind) \n<br> \n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/?action=view&amp;current=cbf3c69b.pbr\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/th_cbf3c69b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br>Listen to the sound of that digger engine. You can see how low the roof was. The strap against the door has twisted the door a bit but most of it came out and its fairly good even right now, it was just a case of having to lift somewhere. \n<br> \n<br>Oh and the people who said i would not be able to wait, dead right. Im having one day off Clinton's to build the chassis jig hopefully tomorrow morning (yes kid with new toy):wink: \n<br> \n<br>Cheers \n<br> \n<br>Mark",

I may not need to use them as i think most of its repairable on the 51 but its nice to have them on hand incase i do. and if i dont i can hang them on the wall in my shed. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> or build a new van \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_idea.gif\" alt=\":idea:\" title=\"Idea\"> \n<br> \n<br>Started these two last night as 3 peices of flat sheet, got out my pallet and hammer and a bit of angle and started. Really pleased with how its gone . \n<br> \n<br> The non rear windows section has the lower metal work for the barndoor lid hinge to mount on. Im trying to make stuff more one peice if i can \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/25112007550.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> The engine lid has the edges folded double all the way round, the rear window section has all the edge folds on too just got make and put the strengheners in both peices. I found a neat trick to get the barndoor lid gently curved across its length as i made it. Making the body line bulge was the hardest bit, but its worked out ok i think. \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i8.photobucket.com/albums/a18/marks72/25112007554.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"> \n<br> \n<br>cheers \n<br> \n<br>Mark",
