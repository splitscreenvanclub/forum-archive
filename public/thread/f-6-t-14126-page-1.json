If you have a USA specification bus then the lamps are seperately fed from the indicator switch. Please state which country you van was from and whether it has seperate indicator and tailight/brake light bulbs.",

Does the indicator switch look original? \n<br> \n<br> I suspect some chopping has gone on by the original owner. It probably works this way as the PO could not get it to work. If you are indicating right and you put your foot on the brake, does it continue to flash. it should. \n<br> \n<br> i think you should concentrate around the indicator switch, and brake light switch rather than at the back of the bus.",
