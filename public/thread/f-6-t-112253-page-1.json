The threaded fixing plate located inside the post. From memory the SSVC member had cut open the post to replace the threaded retaining bracket before welding closed. I'd like to find the thread and pics again before tackling mine but after over two hours searching I can't find the thread anymore. \n<br>\n<br>I need to replace both upper mounts on my 59 project as I had to drill out the hinge as it was never coming away despite heat etc. \n<br>\n<br>Any help much appreciated as always. \n<br>Loz",

Either way you've got to try this method first as the only alternative seems to be cutting into your post. \n<br>\n<br>That said it wouldn't be hard to cut a rectangular slot into the post just sufficient to secure a new retaining plate inside the post. Then just a case of welding the rectangular cut back into place. Bit of a faff but not the end of the world.\n<br>\n<br>PMA \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br>\n<br>You probably know all this but if it was me I'd stick another bolt in through the hole you're not working on or something to hold the plate up up just in case it ends up dropping into the post while you're tapping through. \n<br>\n<br>Piece of cake for you mate now get tapping.",

It had pics of each stage. I'm hoping that I can re thread the old plate and not need to replace. Its one of those jobs that will take hours and have very little to show for all the effort. \n<br>\n<br>However, its getting there and will now be moving onto the front wheel tubs, doglegs and cab floor. Then the bus just might start looking like a real bus again! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\"> \n<br>Catch you soon",
