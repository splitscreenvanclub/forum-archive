Are there any recommended installers about or has everyone DIY fitted them?\n<br>\n<br>Also what locations have people used? i've seen a few on here fitted to the rear plane underneath the rear seat? Has anyone fitted elsewhere? Such as under the front cab seat in that recess?\n<br>\n<br>any info would be most appreciated \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\">",

    "content" : "I've recently has a new Propex HS2211 (external box) fitted by Propex themselves in Ringwood, Hampshire. I wanted a good installation so thought I'd go straight to the manufacturer as they offered the service. It's been a disaster !! I thought the install was very poor and untidy and the system does not produce adequate heat. They brought the ducting into the van via some of the original pipe work whilst my fit out specialists (who were excellent) attached the vents to the furniture.\n<br>I've since taken the van back to Propex who were not interested in the lack of performance or any sort of customer service. They were rude and could only blame everyone else for the lack of heat. They refused to try and rectify the problem (maybe no solution) and refused to give any form of refund.\n<br>I'm sure there are good installers out there but I would avoid Propex themselves. I question the under slung unit re effectiveness as possibly it looses a lot of heat being outside the van. You need to keep the ducting runs as short as possible and there may also be issues when trying to connect to original pipe work as there may be unseen blockages or changes in the bore may affect how effective the heater is. My heater was bought on their advice that the output could be split - front and back - maybe just focus on the back rather than splitting the power and heat the bus from one vent.",

I assume Propex haven't exceeded that on their own install. A van local to me has an inline fan to suck air from the Propex so it can get greater airflow into the van, therefore more heat, as his duct run is long. \n<br>\n<br>I've never seen any type of heater fail to be able to make a van hot when parked up.
