I use two webbing slings to go either side of the box around the cross beam and then back and clear of the bumper, this means they join together right in the centre of the bus and all force is distributed evenly and no body contact even on the lowered bus. Attach the slings to a shackle and on she or he goes via a 2 minute winch. Seems more controlable when on my own although when with others in the team driving on is not an issue. When lowering down, just tilt the trailer a little and let it roll off with reverse winch. On and off in 5 mins and no stress.",

    "content" : "the balancing of the trailer is important. the wieght of the bus should be balanced so that its even across its axel or prehaps slightly biased to the front of the trailer. your tow hook is probably only rated to take 50kg of downward presure. \n<br>\n<br>Also check the load capacity of your car/van can take more than the combined weight of trailer plus bus and what ever is inside the bus. \n<br>\n<br>insure the trailer has its own brakes and that they are working and that the emergency brake cable is hooked seperately over the tow hook. \n<br>\n<br>make sure you get some insurance. you towing car policy might not cover your load and a classic car policy might not cover it being towed. If you drop a bus in front of someone on the m40 and they have an acident you could loose the bus and have a big bill from someone else.",
