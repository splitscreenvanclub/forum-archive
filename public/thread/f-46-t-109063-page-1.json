To convert to a '60 interior you would need to:\n<br>\n<br> - Build a slanted sink unit to replace the (not pictured) cooker unit\n<br> - Stick some folding doors in place of the sliding wardrobe door\n<br> - Add an early cooker cupboard to the rear cargo door\n<br>\n<br>And if you were really going for it then:\n<br>\n<br> - Rebuild the rear seat back to include the sliding compartments\n<br> - Build some rear drawers to incorporate the sliding compartments mentioned above\n<br> - Swap the rear overhead lockers for the earlier side-shelves\n<br>\n<br>Although most people would never notice or bother to replicate these last three I'd guess.\n<br>\n<br>Decent seller too - very friendly, honest and helpful \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">",

He had purchased a right hand drive interior and converted it himself, doing a fantastic job at it. Talking it through with him it's a fair amount of work, but if you've got the skills or can get someone to do it, it's worth the effort.",
