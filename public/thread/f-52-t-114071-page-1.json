    "content" : "I am selling a 1990's Old Skool Quadangle BMX. I bought this 3 years ago from Belgium and have rode it several times. It is in good condition for its age and has the usual scuffs and scrapes. It has Odyssey pedals, Tektro \"V\" brakes, Syway tuff II wheels with DSI tyres and a superstar 3 piece crank. The bike is solid and as far as I am aware original, it has had the Gyro removed for better braking and rides nice and smooth. These bikes are only going up in price. It has a peppermint frame and pink tyres. If you would like some pics please email me on \n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:skemp75@yahoo.co.uk\">skemp75@yahoo.co.uk</a>\n<!-- e --> I am looking for £300 Ono and will deliver to the UK main land only for £20.",
