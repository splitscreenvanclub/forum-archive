    "content" : "Dear Forum Folk. In 2007 I spent a year restoring 'Dolly' our 1979 Bay reg NEC 511V. She was our wedding car and then got us to Spain and back on a 3 week surf road trip. I sold her in 2009 to fund the purchase of my current project, a 1966 Splitty with a 3.6 lt 911 lump running a 4x4 964 transmission. Any hows, I am searching for Dolly as I would love to buy her back for our 10th wedding anniversary. Yes an old romantic. If anyone can help in this search it would be hugely appreciated. Kind Regards JH",
