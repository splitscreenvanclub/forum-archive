This is a job I wish I'd never started. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> \n<br>\n<br>I bought an 8.5mm oversize arm (steel, rather than stainless steel) and bottom hinge pin from Autocraft several months ago and a 8.5mm reamer from ebay.\n<br>\n<br>Got my vernier gauge out and measured the new bottom pin. Just over 8.5mm. Checked the reamer - bang on 8.5mm, so I wedged the door in the correct position and pulled the OG mirror arm out.\n<br>\n<br>Reamed the top hinge and fitted the new arm and found my first problem - the new arm is a very loose fit. I took the arm out and measured it and while Autocraft's pin was 8.59mm, their arm was 8.25mm! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif\" alt=\":x:\" title=\"Mad\">\n<br>\n<br>I know that I should have measured both the pin and the arm before starting, but they were both in their packaging and both labelled 8.5mm and Autocraft don't list an 8.2mm arm so I stupidly assumed that if one was right, the other one would be. It's several months since I bought the parts, so I'll try ordering a stainless steel one and see if it's the right size. If not, I'll complain.\n<br>\n<br>Then I started on the bottom hinge. Absolutely no joy there. Can't get the pin to move at all. I tried knocking it out, but I don't want to wail on it for fear of damaging the hinge mount. Then I tried a G cramp with a socket on top and a bolt underneath, but it kept slipping off. Finally I modified a ball joint splitter as per another post on here, but that won't shift it either. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> I've left it cranked up and will keep spraying it with lube to see if it frees off.

    "content" : "I pulled Errol's engine out a few weeks ago for some TLC. It needed new oil seals and some proper tinware. Got it back in on Saturday. Still need to hook it up and test run it but I've a few more wrinkles to sort first and won't get a chance to get back to it until after Easter.\n<br>\n<br>Old engine out...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1261_zpsxav9hzob.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>It was covered in old, baked-on oil and was leaking from the oil cooler seals, push rod tube seals, flywheel main seal, pulley, sump plate and I'm pretty sure the gearbox input shaft seal was leaking too. Gave the engine a good clean with solvent and replaced the seals. I didn't want to pull the heads as they've been sealed in place with what looks like Permatex. Didn't want to open that can of worms just yet, so I used Scat big-mouth adjustable push rod tubes and fitted a thermostat while I was at it (the old tinware didn't have fan housing flaps, so I've reinstated that)...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1323_zpsriymwaql.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Found a load more bodges from the previous owner and some nice surprises. On the bodge-side, the heat exchangers were barely connected, hardly any air would have been going through the vent pipe to the cab. Also, I knew that the heads were Autolinea aftermarket heads, but they hadn't cleaned the flashing out of some of the channels on the right hand head, so I had to stop assembling to drill it out so I could get the thermostat actuator rod though. with the heads insitu.\n<br>\n<br>On the nicer side, the clutch plate looked brand new. Could even read part of the label printed on the friction material.\n<br>\n<br>I re-assembled the engine with the new tin and got it back in on Saturday. It was a bit more of a struggle than I'd expected to line it up right, but when I did, it slid in nicely...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1351_zpsybfd0cvk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>First time I've removed and refitted a complete engine. I quite enjoyed it. I had to fabricate a couple of bits of tinware - I made an early type of hot air pickup tube for the air cleaner out of 1\" stainless pipe and some perforated strapping and made an air cleaner support triangle for the oil bath cleaner (still need to paint the bracket).\n<br>\n<br>I was a bit p-d off to find that I don't seem to have seated the push rod tube seals correctly though. Had to tilt the engine to get it back on the jack to re-install so the oil sloshed about a bit and started leaking out of the seals at the head end \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> At least they're adjustable tubes, so I can fiddle with them with the engine in. Must remember to take those valve covers off and drain any oil that's in there too and I need to manipulate the seal over the cylinder tins.

I bought some LED 1157-equivalent tail light bulbs, but they're taller than the housing. It looked like the thickness of the seal would prevent them from clashing, but I tightened the screw too much and popped the lens \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif\" alt=\":(\" title=\"Sad\"> . Tested the bulb, and it still works fine. Just have to buy another lens \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> .\n<br>\n<br>I've fitted a CF-14 flasher unit to work with the new LEDs and that's thrown up another problem. I have right indicators, but nothing on the left. I deed to do some diagnostics as the only thing I can think that would cause the flasher not to work at for one side, but fine on the other is a fault with the indicator switch and that's a new (last year) Wolfsburg West switch. I've tested the LED bulb and it's fine. If the connections at the bulb were duff, I'd at least expect the front indicator (filament bulb) to flash. It did when I tested it with the other side's indicators. I'll put a test lamp on the connections tonight if I get time.\n<br>\n<br>Pushed the truck outside and gave the engine bay and transmission a thorough clean with degreaser while the engine and lights were out as well. It was black in there thanks to the leaking oil cooler seals. The fan had blown oil everywhere. Now I can work back there without getting filthy.",

Gave it a clean and lube and it started working for left turn, but then started triggering the flasher unit in the neutral (off) position. Must be a short in the switch somewhere. It's less than 12 months old!",

    "content" : "After putting the engine back in it was p!ssing oil from the new push rod tubes. Did some googling and found that they work better if you get a screwdriver and give a tap on the black metal washer that the seal rides on to seat the seals in to the holes in the head. Gave it a try and it's worked. I'm (relatively) leak free \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\">\n<br>\n<br>The engine sounded awful though, particularly when warm. I followed the Muir diagnostic tree and traced the noise to the crank pulley. A bit of digging and I found that the OG breast plate tin was fouling on the pulley. Took the pulley off and bent the tin back and all's well. It sounds like a VW at last (I think).\n<br>\n<br>Also fixed the indicators issue a couple of weeks ago - it was the Wolfsburg West switch that I replaced last year \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> Schofields replaced it with no hassle - Thanks guys.\n<br>\n<br>I've been working on fitting a stereo over the last weekend. My one rule was 'no drilling', which made it a challenge. I had to fabricate a bracket to suspend a DIN radio pod under the parcel shelf to avoid drilling it. Have fitted a Blaupunkt Dortmund 230 DAB radio with bluetooth streaming and built in hands-free calling. I've used a Retrosounds dual-voice stereo dashboard speaker from Cool Air (fits in the original speaker location) and it sounds pretty good, considering it's basically a mono speaker. I'm also getting good DAB reception inside my garage, which is surprising as I'm using a stick-on windscreen aerial (again - no drilling).\n<br>\n<br>Bracket...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1385_zpsh5mrftae.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Fits like this...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1393_zpsknmezemj.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>It's suspended by the hooks over the parcel tray lip and the other end screws in to two holes that I think were originally for the upper securing screws for the kick boards, although my kick boards aren't drilled for those holes. Wouldn't be too much hassle to fit the bracket even if they were though. A few strips of rubber protect the paintwork.\n<br>\n<br>Looks like this installed...\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1388_zpszxmgw6lk.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Looks really good in real life. The black and chrome of the stereo matches quite well with the black commercial 'trim' and the period fuel gauge that I fitted last year.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t15/Who_Me_Photos/ANDYNEWLAPTOP/TruckPics2/DSC_1394_zpshmoxmrbj.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
