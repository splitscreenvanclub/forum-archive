    "content" : "The '9 prong' relay was intended for USA models requiring both hazard lights and the combined rear indicator and brake lights using a single filament in the rear bulb. Basically, I would suggest the use of the 9 prong relay is significantly more complicated and expensive than is required just to achieve hazard lights. All that is needed is a hazard relay with switch, or can use an external switch as in the photo and a warning lamp if the switch doesn't have one in built. For most models it can be done with a total of 3 connections and to the existing wiring loom and an earth and certainly under Â£20. Email me with your year model for details peter@ volksgoods. co. uk without the spaces\n<br> Peter Good",
