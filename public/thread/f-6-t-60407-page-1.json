If you decide on that route give me a shout and I'll pm you the details of someone to get dropped ones from. these would bolt straight up to your stock 66 beam and would allow you to fit bay disc brakes with of course bay PCD.\n<br>\n<br>you do not necessarily need a bay beam and ball joint trailing arms to do what you mentioned.\n<br>\n<br>If you want porsche or wide 5 PCD then you'll need to get a kit that fits the dropped spindles you have ordered. Gingerbuses' willwoods or CSP's, although these will be ALOT more money than buying a set of 2nd hand bay discs so it depends on your budget and plans.",
