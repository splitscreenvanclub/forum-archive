    "content" : "OK super-pervs, can anyone help me ID these parts and help me with the differences.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Firstly a door cupboard. I picked up three quarters of it from the lovely Matt Smith last week after months maybe years of annoying him asking about it. Got it home and found a spare top door to complete it. I don't know if it is the correct one but I have reason to believe it might be.\n<br>\n<br>The cupboard came from a very late (thin front arches late) '62 Devon. '62s had a cooker on the rear door and the cutlery cupboard on the front door though, of which this appears to be neither. So I'm thinking it's a MY63 bathroom cabinet and Devon had brought the '63 style in at the very end of MY62.\n<br>\n<br>Whole cabinet:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/087_zpsad73260b.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/087_zpsad73260b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>My spare door held as it would open - upwards - all the holes line up and it fits perfectly:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/089_zps9d963a78.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/089_zps9d963a78.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Shelf in the middle with plasticised aluminium edging as seen on magazine racks of the era:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/094_zps27e4c714.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/094_zps27e4c714.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Hole in top of cupboard for mounting flap-up door:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/092_zps31814906.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/092_zps31814906.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Hole in my spare door to mount to cabinet:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/091_zps55b49937.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/091_zps55b49937.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Rubber bump stops for the flip up door to close against:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/093_zps81a2ef86.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/093_zps81a2ef86.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Bottom door flips down and top door has evidence of mirror mounting - but the mirror mounted with top and bottom screws whereas the reference pics of Rippers' later '64 bathroom cabinet has the mirror mounted left to right:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/097_zps472413ad.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/097_zps472413ad.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>Rippers' '64 bathroom cabinet, obviously his catch is on the opposite side because his is LHD:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/c4cab3e4.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>But also his top door hinges are different:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Devon%20interior/P1010739.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>So this got me investigating...\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>I have a couple of spare catches and bits that belong to other parts, and I noticed differences. \n<br>\n<br>Firstly the mag rack catch that also holds the bathroom cabinet door open and also holds the lid of the '62 sink open. I have three different styles. From my '62 sink unit (cabinet photographed on its side; the lid opens up to the right):\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/101_zps4105f540.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/101_zps4105f540.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And two different ones from mag racks (with the '62 sink one on the right):\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/108_zpse14dc48b.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/108_zpse14dc48b.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>They also have slightly different offsets from the screw holes to the edge of the catch. The one from the mag rack doesn't fit the bathroom cabinet door and would be upside down:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/102_zps749a97bf.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/102_zps749a97bf.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The middle of my three from another mag rack does fit it, and also is the correct way round for the other half of the catch to operate properly with a gravity-assisted close (left of photo is the top of the door when open):\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/110_zps0894d872.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/110_zps0894d872.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The same as Rippers' but with the 180 degree flip as his is LHD:\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i1206.photobucket.com/albums/bb454/splitty64/Devon%20interior/P1010743.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>So onto the two mag racks I have.\n<br>\n<br>The first is the owner of the longest catch. It has a flat (not curved) slope to the edge where the magazines go in. It has a flat front (no raised details):\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/106_zpsb8044d2c.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/106_zpsb8044d2c.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>The second has a curved top where the magazines go in. It has ribbed batons running down the front face:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/107_zps8f36abc7.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/107_zps8f36abc7.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>And finally, the slider catches. The top one here is from the bathroom cabinet described above, the bottom one is from one of my '62 sink units:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1068.photobucket.com/user/clymoj/media/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/099_zps0cc224c2.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1068.photobucket.com/albums/u451/clymoj/62-63%20Devon%20bathroom%20cabinet/099_zps0cc224c2.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>So:\n<br>\n<br>1. is my cabinet a '63 bathroom cabinet?\n<br>2. have I found the correct door for it?\n<br>3. are there year changes in the mag rack catches or is there just a difference between ones that go on the left or right hand side of the bus?\n<br>4. which mag rack is early or late, when did they change and which should I keep for my '62 interior?\n<br>5. are there year specific differences to the slider catches?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance.",
