    "content" : "Veba 10.2\" DVD/ Monitor in a beige colour. I have had 2 laser cut stainless brackets made up so it mounts easily to the airbox (with either self tappers or you can use rivnuts like we did). The player has a very small footprint so looks more integrated than other players. It also has lights which I wired to the dash switch to replace the airbox light. Comes with the remote, all the wiring, the custom brackets and the original manual.\n<br>I am looking for £75 plus postage. This cost me about £300 when new\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5575/14836605463_d8730e0ef0_h.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3860/14814397874_60fb629b60_h.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
