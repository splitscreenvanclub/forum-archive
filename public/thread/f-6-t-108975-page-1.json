Don't try heating it up with a blow torch though. If your gearbox is magnesium it'll go up a treat (think back to chemistry at school).\n<br>\n<br>Worst case scenario, take an angle grinder to it, open up one side and it should come off. A replacement arm is cheap enough and readily available.\n<br>\n<br>Hope that helps !",
