    "content" : "I've recently joined the SSVC so just thought I'd introduce myself and my VW. My name's Roger and I live in Long Eaton near Nottingham. My VW is a converted panel van camper - possibly an EZ conversion originaly but with a home made camper kit in it now. I bought it in Dec 2008 from a guy in Malvern - about 1 mile from the show ground. He bought it off the American Ebay site about 2 months previously. It was painted dark blue and looked like it had never been polished. I liked it but thought it would look better in it's original colour of L345 grey. So last July I started stripping the 5 layers of paint off it back to it's original colour. I found about 60 - 70% of the original paint and some filler that I removed and a quite a few holes where a slide hammer had been used. I straightened some areas out and welded all the holes up and then tried to blend in some new paint to match the old - not the easiest thing to do but it doesn't look too bad. It's got all it's original panels which I guess is due to living in California for the first 50 years of it's life. So 10 months later it was back to it's original colour and I'm very happy with it's new/old look. \n<br> Before and after pics of the paint stripping :\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e276/orangegalaxie/vwbus012.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i41.photobucket.com/albums/e276/orangegalaxie/vwnearlyfinished006-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",
