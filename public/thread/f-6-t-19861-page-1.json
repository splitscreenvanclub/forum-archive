What I'm worried about is kinking the track so that the curtain sliders won't actually slide.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for all of your help\n<br> \n<br> flip\n<br> \n<br> p.s. awesome van mate, where was the picture taken?

    "content" : "cheers, the pics were taken in anglesey.\n<br> \n<br> just used a small drill and self tappers to screw to the lip. it now dips slightly running round under the airvent. dead easy to do, you need a hacksaw, a small file, a (cordless) drill, small drill bit, screwdriver and screws. it would be quite difficult to kink it enough to stop the tracks running. the difficult bit for me was lining it up so the curtain can run all round the track if i wanted to - not really necessary, but sometimes useful when you are doing a job at one side of the van and want to get the curtains out of the way without taking them off.",
