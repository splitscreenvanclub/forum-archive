    "content" : "Mike , that's correct VW Australia have no records at all, many have tried to get info but they cannot tell you a thing.\n<br>That's why if you try and get a birth certificate from Germany they do not have the records from AUS so they just guess from the chassis number, which might work if your van is pre 61?\n<br>Also as Australia is made of different States they each have their own Motor Reg Departments and they have no details either.\n<br>Even if you went to one of them with your number plate or even the chassis number they would not have any info and even if they did they cannot tell you anything because of the crap privacy laws here.\n<br>If you have an Aussie van with no Aussie numberplate or rego sticker (tax disc) you will never know what State in AUS it came from and you will never know how many owners or who they were. In AUS they don't list how many previous owners on any docs.\n<br>Dave",
