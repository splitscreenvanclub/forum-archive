    "content" : "Devon only fitted on front door as per VW. Basically the check strap goes through a slot cut in the filet at the side of the tall cupboard. The pin is accessible inside the cupboard. On mine and others I have seen there is a wooden door prop held by a blacked dome capped japanned wood screw. This allows the front cargo door to be propped open but the check strap holds the door from bashing the drivers door.\n<br> \n<br> I have dimensions of position n size of prop \n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200710/16e9f0e4298294dd8ac08adc1a5f795f.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20200710/28b025fe2b970342abb9d9ffeb1501a1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">",

The cargo doir inner pressing as I recall even has a pair of indents to take the screws for the door cleat.\n<br> I am unaware if VW fitted a check strap to Deluxe buses on the back of the C post. \n<br> I have seen check straps similarly fitted to a 65 MY Devon style interior on the C post at a similar height.\n<br>",
