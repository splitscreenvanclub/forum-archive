On closer inspection I wasn't happy with the bed and seeing as I'm going to the expense of having all trimmed it seemed daft to scrimp on the foundations of this so that ended up in the skip. I spoke to Lee and he was up against it with a backlog but luckily Mark at T2D had one in stock ready to ship. Whilst I waited for the bed to arrive I removed the existing ply lining and set about sound deadening and insulating. I used self adhesive 'dead mat' bought from eBay and I used 25 in total - we are going to buy ten more between us though as my roof could do with some more.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TheChud/media/18FE45DC-18D4-49B2-B069-F5A1715EC482_zpskfpe7inj.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s476/TheChud/18FE45DC-18D4-49B2-B069-F5A1715EC482_zpskfpe7inj.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>And then I started flinging celotex about.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TheChud/media/9871B243-849E-4050-A228-80F7AF04C526_zpsyjpfllka.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s476/TheChud/9871B243-849E-4050-A228-80F7AF04C526_zpsyjpfllka.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TheChud/media/6203912C-6718-4AEA-8E38-66C12BE91CD3_zpst3nodgia.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s476/TheChud/6203912C-6718-4AEA-8E38-66C12BE91CD3_zpst3nodgia.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I'm really happy with how the deadening performs, I no longer feel like I'm driving a kettle drum around and the insulation seems to have made a massive difference but I won't see the full benefits until the roof is done and lined.\n<br>\n<br>As you can see in the pictures the bed turned up as promised and installation was painless.\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TheChud/media/894C092D-350D-4BC1-B884-F2007D206918_zps8cjqukas.jpg.html\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i1053.photobucket.com/albums/s476/TheChud/894C092D-350D-4BC1-B884-F2007D206918_zps8cjqukas.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>After that I thought I'd have a crack at replacing the cab door rubbers so with the help of a mate on site we made a start. The outer rubber went fine, lulled us into a false sense of security and rapidly spiralled into the worst 2.5 hours of rubber based activity that I've ever had. The window channels went okay, but the quarter light nearly ended up being taped up for the drive home, so close were we of losing the will to live with it. We did succeed in the end though so one door down, one to go. I didn't take any pictures, I was far too fragile. \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/bom.gif\" alt=\":bom:\" title=\"bom\"> \n<br>\n<br>Off to the trimmers tomorrow to confirm colour matches.",
