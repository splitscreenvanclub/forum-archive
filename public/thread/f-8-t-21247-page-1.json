    "content" : "Well here goes... sorry in advance for the long post!!\n<br> \n<br> After selling my Karmann ghia in 2005 and spending 6 months without a vw, I started looking around for a 23 window samba.\n<br> With prices going up the way that they were, I knew that I had to buy one soon, or never be able to afford my dream!!\n<br> \n<br> I really wanted a pre 58 samba with pressed bumpers. \n<br> However, the better half wouldn't allow me to get a LHD bus as she didn't like the idea of driving one in the UK. \n<br> \n<br> After a few dissapointments, I eventually found a thread on the SSVC website for a 1963 RHD 23 window bus. \n<br> Better still, the owner lived less than 5 miles away in the road next door to where my brother lived!! Fate??\n<br> \n<br> When I went round to see the van it was still up on railway sleepers as it was not yet finished. \n<br> \n<br> I was really lucky, as it was being sold by a really genuine guy (who was honest throughout), pointing out all that was good as well as bad with the bus.\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> This is what it looked like.........\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/Dscn0639.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSCN0396.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/Dscn0635.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00681.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> It had a few issues with rust etc, but was more or less complete. \n<br> You can just see the OG turkis that was found after chipping away the underseal.\n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00667.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00679.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00677.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/Dscn0682.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00678.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i115.photobucket.com/albums/n289/flipthephysio/DSC00668-1.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Needless to say, the deal was struck and I bought it in principal there and then!! \n<br> \n<br> I had an anxious wait for another couple of months until the work was done and the van was running once more. \n<br> I kept worrying that the owner would fall in love with the bus like I was, and would keep it!!
