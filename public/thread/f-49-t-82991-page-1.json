    "content" : "Just trying to figure out how best to fit a headlining in my 67 11-window kombi. I've run it for 12 years with bare metal and dynamat as it never had one when I bought it. I've got a couple of questions about standard/original headliners in later splits if anyone can help;\n<br>\n<br>The rear bow/rod which runs through the headlining to hold it up; how far from the back of the bus does it sit? My bus seems to have no holes for the bow to clip into so I guess the metal rod just sits in the top of the gutter above the windows, but I have no ideas where abouts it should be!?\n<br>\n<br>How long is the above bow/rod? I bought a replacement from VW Heritage and it seems way too long and simply won't fit. Just wondered if anyone had an original one kicking about and could measure?\n<br>\n<br>Does anyone have any pics of a well fitted headlining which they could post, especially the front area around the air vents and the rear area with the rear bow and rear door hinge covers?\n<br>\n<br>Ta\n<br>Steven",
