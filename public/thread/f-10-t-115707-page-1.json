We have showers, food, bars, site wide Wi-Fi, Cash points and a site shop for basic provisions. Dogs are allowed on site and evening entertainment is FREE. \n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">There are a few changes (as usual!) to this year’s event. </span> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_bounce.gif\" alt=\":bounce:\" title=\"bounce\"> \n<br>\n<br>I am afraid that we will not be able to run a crèche facility on the site this year so this may lead to even more toddlers being dragged round the site in carts! \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>However we will be adding a bit extra to our BUSFEST CINEMA in the Severn Hall which will be exclusively playing children’s (Disney Type) Films throughout the weekend. \n<br>\n<br>Another casualty is our SOAPBOX Derby. After a very promising start last year there just has not been the take up we need this year to present a second Derby so we have put it on hold for the time being.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Now for some good news: </span> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cheers.gif\" alt=\":cheers:\" title=\"cheers\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">SUNSHINE &amp; SHOWERS </span>\n<br>\n<br>OK, I am working on the sunshine bit but for Campers (and anyone else who may get a bit messy during the weekend after becoming zombiefied! ) I am pleased to announce that we will be adding (at least) 3 more shower blocks to our welfare facilities this year. These are likely to be located at Family Camping, Yellow (Dog Free Camping) Block &amp; Teme Toilet Block. I am afraid we cannot site any showers in the General Camping area (yet) due to drainage issues, but these blocks are not too far from most of the camping areas\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">A NEW BOTCHED UP VOICE FOR BUSFEST</span>\n<br>\n<br>I am very pleased to announce that we have secured the services of Paul (“Botch”) Venners to be our “man on the mike” this year. Paul and I go back a very long time &amp; I am sure many of you in the VW World will have heard his chatter before if you have ever been to the “Pod”.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">BUSFEST ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE</span>\n<br>\n<br>For this year’s event we have opted for a “ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE” fancy dress theme (but don’t worry; we have also allocated several “Zombie-free safe zones” across the site for those of you with small children or who prefer a more traditional Busfest experience.)\n<br>\n<br>We have secured the services of “ZOMBIE INFECTION” to help us deal with the Zombie issue on site and really raise the stakes (and excitement) for this year’s event. \n<br>\n<br>ZOMBIE INFECTION Events, is the UK’s premier ZOMBIE EXPERIENCE company and are our theatrical partners for this year’s Busfest - Zombie Apocalypse. \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://zombieinfection.co.uk/\">http://zombieinfection.co.uk/</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<br>They will be showing what they do around the showground, in The Marquee Friday &amp; Saturday nights, and at their Zombie Zone in the Fun Zone alongside Main Street.\n<br>\n<br>I'm very pleased to say that we have devised some despicable theatrics in the Marquee for Friday and Saturday nights, as well as some diabolical goings on around Main Street during the afternoons. \n<br>They will also have a display stand in the Fun Zone, showing you what they do up and down the country, as well as make - up and Zombie artefacts for sale. \n<br>\n<br>They will also have professional Zombie make-up artists on hand to help you perfect that 'just dead' look!\n<br>\n<br>Finally, we have devised a \"get out if you can\" zombie experience alongside, with clues to help you escape the room before the Zombie in the corner gets off his leash! (Timed event, for a small fee)\n<br>\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://WWW.BUSFEST.ORG\">http://WWW.BUSFEST.ORG</a>\n<!-- m -->",
