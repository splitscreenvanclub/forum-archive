I'm not painting of it though so I can't test this\n<br>\n<br>Drying time seems to be slow though, I have been out tonight working and it's not completely hardened and I painted it about 11 am today.\n<br>\n<br>Finally I recommend head and shoulders to get it out of your hair....wear a hat, or better still a balaclava!",
