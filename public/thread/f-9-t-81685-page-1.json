We expected this to be fairly easy in a wildpark but it seemed a lot harder than we thought. All small roads ended at somebody’s house or farm. So did a tricky sandtrail we decided to take. When we got to the farm a man came asking what we are searching for. I told him we liked is off road trail and ended up at his farm. He started talking about his natural water source and how he bottled this water and sells it though out the region. After some more chitchat the man asked if we were looking for a campspot. We did as a matter of facts so he offered us his one of his fields. It was enormously and full of little yellow butterflowers. All privacy in the world and it was the ultimate hippy experience for us. \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020375Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020389Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We did some shopping earlier that day. In GB there is a thing called Marks and Spencers(M&amp;S). Sort of a supermarket but you can only find luxury meals for way too much money. We got ourselves a nice dinner being pasta and fresh fish. Just delicious: \n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020393Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>We took some water from our guy:\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020405Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020414Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The highest point of Dartmoor is a bare, rocky place with big stones lying everywhere.

These horses run freely through the national parks but they are marked and watched by some people. They are not scared of people and it’s a nice sighting to see them run and play.\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020450Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>The Eden project turned out to be on our route so we decided to check it out.

This is the most western point of the UK. But first a bit of beach:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020526Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Lands End:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020557Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Next place wat St. Ives. One of the prettiest cities of Cornwall if you ask us. Found a nice campsite over there. \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020577Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020583Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>It’s time to visit Exmoor Park. It’s a bit like Dartmoor but a bit more sweet and lovely. We really like the roads getting there.\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020591Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020601Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020647Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>In Exmoor we found an off road track. We couldn’t resist this one but when we got down in the Valley it turned out te be quite wet. We thought we saw a good campsite but it clearly wasn’t. So we got stuck. No one around and no suitable tyres for these conditions…We managed to get loose again but had to turn also. Full speed up the hill until we got stuck again and then a sharp turn go get us going again. This was a close one, if we got like 5 meters deeper in this valley we wouldn’t be able to get out on our own. Always nice to have some adventure from time to time… \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020661Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020658Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>Managed to get out of this mess again we found a spot that suited us as a campsite also. We got kicked out by a guy who was hunting over there and he told us he wouldn’t want to shoot us while hunting. So we searched for a regular campsite. We found this in 5 minutes and it was the best ever. We got our own field and it was cheap also. \n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020677Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>British breakfast:\n<br>\n<img src=\"http://i407.photobucket.com/albums/pp155/EvelynSerge/Vakantie%20Engeland%20-%20Werchter%20-%20Le%20mans/P1020696Large.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br>\n<br>But a roadtrip is a roadtrip, so after a lovely summer morning we started driving again.

So we decided to co-drive with him. This car is truelly unbelievable. All the noises it makes, it’s like it’s alive. Straight cut, non-sychro gearbox, dubble clutching, everything. Make no mistake, this car is in perfect condition. Every thing Works, it has fresh MOT and no structural rust.

And they are being used and raced also. Many Bugatti’s, Bentleys, Ferrari’s, Porsches and you would not see on a regular event. We where guests at the Flat4France club. A field full of busses, Porsches, Beetles and Ghisa’s.
