Underneath the useage part it explains that if i continue using this amount (zero) at the standard rate my Gas will cost me £94.67p. So 0 x £0 a month x 12 months = £94.67p \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br>\n<br>However if i switch to a fixed tariff i can save over £7.80 on my annual bill ................... \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\"> \n<br>\n<br>What a firm............really inspiring \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\":wink:\" title=\"Wink\">",
