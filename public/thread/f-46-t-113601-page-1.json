    "content" : "The cooker looks very much like a Canterbury Pitt one, but without the mechanism to make it flip out of a door cupboard. It obviously has some legs to make it a table top version instead. Are those corner legs removable? If so I think it would be worth a lot more to a CP owner.\n<br>\n<br>Just a quick edit to the above point...\n<br>I now see (from older posts) that you've already got a CP cupboard. The cooker does look to be correct for a CP but you may need someone to make you up the brackets that would make if fold with the cupboard. I also see that someone says its correct for a Devon too... I didn't know that! \n<br>\n<br>Personally in your position I'd try to make it work with the CP. They are definitely the best splitty cookers (in my experience) and you look like you are 90% of the way there.\n<br>\n<br>Other than that I'm sorry but I don't know its value. CP door cookers (with cupboard) seem to go for between £300 - £400 ish if that helps?!?!?",
