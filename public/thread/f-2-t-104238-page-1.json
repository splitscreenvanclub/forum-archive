Can anyone recommend a company that might be able to help? Ive tried Adrian flux, classic line insurance, and herts insurance, but they are coming out with huge quotes of nearly £2000 without any european cover!\n<br>\n<br>My current policy will cover me for 30days and then I will be covered for 3rd party fire and theft, but I don't really want to risk it \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Grin\">\n<br>\n<br>Thanks in advance.\n<br>\n<br>Amy.",
