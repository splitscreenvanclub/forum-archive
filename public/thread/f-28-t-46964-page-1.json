    "content" : "I dont think you can fit a Berg 5 speed in a bus as you cant change the nose as you do with a bug to split conversion, therefore the shift rod would have to sit higher up and it would be a PITA to adapt the shifter.\n<br>\n<br>I went for a Porsche 901/914 box which hasn't been too bad to fit but they aren't the strongest box so I wouldn't fancy wrecking one with 200lbft of torque. Your best bet is a Porsche 915 but thats quite messy too as you need to chop the torsion bar out and fit coilovers and lots of reinforcement. It may be worth talking to bears about their 5 speed box which cant be far off either.\n<br>\n<br>At the end of the day a 5 speed box wont be much benefit to you anyway. Your torque curve is mega flat so you've not got any \"power band\" which you need to keep in. Your bus will just go. You'd be better off with a rhino case, welded gears and super diff sort of thing with a tall final drive.",
