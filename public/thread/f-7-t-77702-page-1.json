    "content" : "Afternoon all,\n<br>\n<br>Went out to the fire bus today to find some unsavory sort has stolen the roof rack! It now looks naked and I'm trying not to punch things. Not sure if it'll be covered on the insurance and I won't be able to get the same one again anyway so I'm still fuming. I'll try and post a picture below if someone can tell me how to do it??? Please keep your eyes peeled and let me know if one like this comes up. Knowing my luck it's being melted down for scrap as I post this.\n<br>\n<br>GRRRRRRRRR!!!",
