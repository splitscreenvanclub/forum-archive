Unfortunately the mounting positions for the bellow rib bracket got wiped out when the half of the roof was replaced.\n<br>\n<br>Could we try and get some measurements as to where they should be please?\n<br>\n<br>I'm talking about the following:\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"http://s35.photobucket.com/user/Goldetop/media/Roof/IMG_0871.jpg.html\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false;\" class=\"postlink\"><img src=\"http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d152/Goldetop/Roof/IMG_0871.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"></a>\n<br>\n<br>I'm not sure what datum you'll need to use, but any useful measurement points and pictures like previously will be great.\n<br>\n<br>Thanks folks!",

    "content" : "Hi Matt\n<br>\n<br>I had a look at the location of the holes you were asking about .......\n<br>\n<br>If you look at the photo below (front of bus), measuring up from the roof gutter it is 180mm to bottom screw hole or 140mm from top of hinge to bottom screw hole. You can see the screw holes up in front of the roof opening. The distance from vertical angle iron at front of roof aperture, measures 60mm.\n<br>\n<br>For the rear of the bus, the measurements were a little different, from the gutter to bottom screw hole it measures 187mm or from top of hinge 147mm. So, on my bus the 'bellow rib brackets' mount 7mm higher at the rear?? I have the same measure from angle iron/aperture opening to screws of 60mm. Both front and rear, the 2 screw holes are 33mm apart.\n<br>\n<br>Hope this helps.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7560/15714189560_8e90578049_o.jpg\" alt=\"Image\">",
