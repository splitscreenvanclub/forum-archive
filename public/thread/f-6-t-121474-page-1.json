Plus your 4th gear has about the best for a lower cruising revs. \n<br> Send a pm to “onion” on here (Owen Warlow) as he usually has a few different boxes hanging about. \n<br> Or if the van is a keeper, speak to someone like Bears to find out how much to get yours rebuilt, that way you know it’s good for years to come.",
