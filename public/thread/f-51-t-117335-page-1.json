Imported from Texas where she had sat for many years so she's a very dry and solid bus that required very little rust repair. The body has undergone an extensive yet sympathetic restoration in order to keep her identity and unique story, with all repairs being paint blended to match her original aged persona. The underside was stripped and zinc primed, stone chipped then painted body colour so is now not only protected it also looks just as good as the top. The interior is an original EZ camper conversion that are very hard to find these days, it is 80% all original with only a couple of pieces needing to be made as originals could not be found. The conversion consists of two bench seats, one of which folds out into rock and roll bed. Three fold up tables, one large main table and two smaller ones. There's a fridge and water tank with pump tap for doing the washing up. A wardrobe, head locker and spice rack making for ample storage, all in all a very usable and well thought out camper interior. The upholstery has been retrimmed in a hard wearing brown canvas that contrasts amazingly against the wood interior and also the light grey exterior. Matching brown curtains and a light oatmeal carpet finish the interior off.\n<br>\n<br>All the mechanicals have been gone through and have either been replaced with new or rebuilt and restored. She is running the following configuration: 4\" CB performance narrowed beam, dropped spindles, all new track rods and drop link, raised rebuilt steering box, butty's bits accelerator pedal linkage, 1300cc straight axle gearbox, 1600cc twin port engine, all new drum brakes all round, dual circuit master cylinder, new hard and soft lines throughout, rebuilt fuse box and all wiring gone through and cleaned. Everything works and she runs, drives and stops as she should!\n<br>\n<br>The windows have been replaced with rare Westy Jealousy windows as the EZ camper Hehr windows were missing when I got her and prefer the look of the westy ones a lot more. They all work fine and don't look out of place with the image of the bus.\n<br>\n<br>I have a photobucket album full of pictures on the restoration on this bus that I can send to serious enquiries. The bus will be sold with a 12 months mot and full UK registration completed.\n<br>\n<br>I live in a port town and can assist in shipping abroad.\n<br>\n<br>Â£32000ono\n<br>\n<br>Robert Gwinnett\n<br>\n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://www.drferdinands.com\">http://www.drferdinands.com</a>\n<!-- m -->\n<br>\n<!-- e -->\n<a href=\"mailto:rob@drferdinands.com\">rob@drferdinands.com</a>\n<!-- e -->",
