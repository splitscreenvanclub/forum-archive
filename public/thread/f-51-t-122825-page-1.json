    "content" : "March 1961 Westfalia SO34:\n<br> \n<br> I have ummed and ahhhd over selling but now I have decided to let her go.\n<br> \n<br> Super rare RHD, straight, reliable bus with original interior in fantastic condition...just buy and enjoy !!\n<br> \n<br> Right Hand Drive !!!\n<br> Original interior (complete right down to 'fridge shelf and ice tray) including single leg table\n<br> Mostly original upholstery (Front seat needs recovering )\n<br> Original Tent poles\n<br> \n<br> BBT repro canopy canvas\n<br> Repro Safaris (originals were too far gone, but all original window furniture retained)\n<br> 6 pop outs with original spoons\n<br> Obviously all new rubberwear!\n<br> Original cab mat.\n<br> Fully Rebuilt gearbox.\n<br> New internally coated petrol tank and resistant fuel lines.\n<br> New brake cylinders, and added servo assisted dual circuit master cylinder for safety, new brake lines where required)\n<br> Rebuilt reduction gears\n<br> New tyres (approx 3000 miles on them)\n<br> Strong 1500 engine that came with bus but not original \n<br> Re registered last year with interesting numberplate RIG 5034 (ie SO34!) \n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Bus was imported from Zimbabwe, via South Africa and returned to its original colour. The only metal that had to be replaced was near side sill and a small hole ( 50p sized) on cab floor patch.\n<br> \n<br> The bus is little known on the circuit although I achieved an ambition to join the BBT Convoy to Hessich Olendorf in 2017...didnt miss a beat HO to Home in single day (I was more knackered than the bus!) For the first time I took her to a VW show this year (Quex, Kent) was persuaded to enter her for judging by some enthusiastic attendees and won Best in Show !!!\n<br> \n<br> Valued 3 years ago by SSVC at Â£59000\n<br> Insured for Â£60000 agreed\n<br> \n<br> The price is Â£48,000 firm , which is a fair price for a very rare Westy in this condition. I'm sorry but I will not budge from this. Just saves the usual listing for Â£55k and selling at Â£48k mularky! So before you view please ensure you can pay the price. \n<div class=\"inline-attachment\"> \n <dl class=\"file\"> \n  <dt class=\"attach-image\">\n   <img src=\"./download/file.php?id=32095&amp;sid=9035bf03bc08b8431f4e898e10707950\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"VWBus1.jpg\" onclick=\"viewableArea(this);\">\n  </dt> \n  <dd>\n   VWBus1.jpg (33.13 KiB) Viewed 2437 times\n  </dd> \n </dl> \n</div> More photos emailed on request.",
