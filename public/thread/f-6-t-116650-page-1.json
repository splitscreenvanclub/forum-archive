But what about when the suspension is on rebound - would the shock extend enough to allow that saucer to move if the spring reaches the end of its travel? \n<br> \n<br> Thanks.",

    "content" : "Eventually got these fitted this afternoon.\n<br> \n<br> No real dramas. Managed to get them to fit with my 2 inch narrowed beam by fitting the bottom rear bolt with no washers and the top rear bolt with just a spring washer. Got a few mm of clearance between the spring and bolt head so happy with that.\n<br> \n<br> Wound the bottom ring up until there is just a bit of tension in the spring and reckon that's pulled the bus up about half an inch.\n<br> \n<br> Gonna leave the suspension to settle for a few days but reckon I may have to wind it up a bit more as don't think the spring is doing a lot although the ride height is spot on at the moment.\n<br> \n<br> Couple of tiny concerns...when u Jack the bus up the shock is stopping the wheels drop down the full way..I.e. the piston of the coilover is at the extent of its travel and the weight of the suspension is trying to pull it further.\n<br> \n<br> Also, when bus is, jacked up, the spring comes out of the top washer so when u lower the, bus down u have to make sure the spring is located in the top washer.\n<br> \n<br> Don't think either is a real issue.",
