All necessary documents available. The engine size is 1600cc and the year is 1959.\n<br>\n<br>My husband passed away 1 month ago and now i am in Denmark, visiting my parents during this difficult time.\n<br>\n<br>The price is: £14.000, more than fair i could say. \n<br>I want to close this deal through eBay. It will be delivered from the UK by my relative and I’ll pay the costs. It will arrive at your address in 2-3 days, then you’ll have 5 days for inspection. Delivery process will start in the same day when we have the transaction confirmed through eBay. I will not get your payment until you’ll receive, inspect and agree with the van. This is their policy regarding this type of transactions.\n<br>\n<br>If you are serious about buying it, i can set up a private listing on eBay with a Buy It Now option so we can go through the Buyer Protection Program.\n<br>\n<br>Looking forward to hear from you.\n<br>Many thanks!\n<br> PS BUY IT NOW SO I CAN SKIM YOUR MONEY......",
