    "content" : "So, I got my seal kit, just about to finish off this morning and fit the backing plates etc, a quick trial fit looks good!\n<br>\n<br>I asked a question on the FB page regarding the orientation of the backing plates, hand brake at the top or bottom as there seems to be a mix of opinions on that one! I was reading the bus boys instructions and they say top, but plenty of other sources say bottom. I have decided to stay at the bottom. I have the extensions tubes from Butties bits and I did read on another thread about putting these at the other end of the hand brake conduit to make the angle going into the backing plate a lot better? I think that came from VW jim, so going down that route!\n<br>\n<br>When I bought all the bits for this, there was another set of complete backing plates, these look like they are Beetle with 30mm shoes, I assume these were there as most of the hardware (except shoes and cylinders) are used on T3 brakes, a quick look on various sites suggests that they are shared, springs, handbrake lever etc\n<br>\n<br>and the T3 cylinders I got don't fit too well on the backing plates, had to elongate the holes slightly \n<br>\n<br>Tony",

Now corrected!\n<br>\n<br>Everything is in place and bolted in, got round to fitting the brake shoes and drums and ran into a problem!\n<br>\n<br>The drums appear to be right for the backing plates, but the shoes I ordered seem to be too big, they only just fit inside the rim of the backing plate, which could suggest the parts I bought as T3 are not what they seem!\n<br>The drums are correct, wide five, had to drill them and tap to M14\n<br>I got another set of backing plates which look to be off a beetle, these are smaller shoes, from what I remember, these were included as a source of parts such as the hand brake lever and bars that fit between the shoes etc\n<br>\n<br>Is there any way to check I have the correct backing plates?\n<br>\n<br>Thanks\n<br>\n<br>Tony",

You then need wheel cylinders for a late bug as well . Shoes also need to be for a late bug 40mm wide the only parts that are different is the drum itself and the bearing retainer (should be an early bug one sits taller than a late one ) the spacer kit will then hold the drum in the correct place to allow it all to be done up . \n<br>Just looks like whoever sold you the backplates sold you 2 early plates and 2 late bug plates I guess .",
