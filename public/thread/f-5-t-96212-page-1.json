    "content" : "AFAIK the brackets have one side with a square cut end and the other end has a cut away section. The pole length is the exact size so that one end inserts fully into the square cut end and then the other end just drops just into the cut off section and slides towards the cut away end so in theory it is inserted and stays in both ends?\n<br>It did not originally have any springs but I suppose you could drill a hole through and put a retaining pin in?\n<br>\n<br>Oh and as for trying the count the dots...I tried that and the material stretches and they are not evenly spaced on different sides so it would be an approximation. \n<br>On my 65 the X spacing is different to the Y spacing!
