It won't tell them what to mix up to match your exact colour if it isn't a standard colour.\n<br>I had mine done and it matched the white very well. Mine is supposed to be cumulus white on top but isn't, it's much whiter. From the photo yours also looks much whiter than culmlus white.\n<br>The bottom colour of mine could not be matched with the anaylser (It's supposed to be Sea Blue) but was clearly mixed up with random colours to get close to Sea Blue. Non of their paints were close enough for a match.",
