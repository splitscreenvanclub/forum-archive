I am going to get the owner to clean that up\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j298/stcos85/SDC10013.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<img src=\"http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j298/stcos85/SDC10014.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">[/quote]\n<br> \n<br> Has there been any previous occurences of a van getting the wrong id plates as the numbers all seem to be right or is this just a case of someone converting a panel?",
