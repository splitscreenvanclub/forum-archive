    "content" : "****MOVED FROM BUSSES FOR SALE**** put a price on it and it will go back, thanks\n<br> \n<br> Hi all,\n<br> \n<br> I'm sorry to say that we are selling our '64 bus, and I am seeking advice about how much we can ask for it. Sadly, new job means that I just don't have the time to keep working on it.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks for any advice,\n<br> \n<br> cheers\n<br> \n<br> Dave\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> There's a whole bunch of photos to be found here:\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://s1185.photobucket.com/albums/z358/YellowCedar/Splitty/\" class=\"postlink\">http://s1185.photobucket.com/albums/z35 ... r/Splitty/</a>\n<br> \n<br> Here is some information...\n<br> We've owned it for about 5 years and have done less than 2000 miles. I understand that the vehicle spent some time in S Africa before being brought to the UK.\n<br> \n<br> 1964 Right hand drive camper - has Devon-like interior.\n<br> Engine is a 1300 Beetle AB type.\n<br> Mileage unknown, as the odometer is stuck.\n<br> MOT expires in February 2013.\n<br> Location - near Bangor, N. Wales\n<br> \n<br> Roof repaired and sprayed with 2 pack.\n<br> Underneath - chassis repairs, new outriggers, new nearside inner/outer sill with the optional strengthener, offside had the rear half of the inner sill and body replaced, along with sundry other repairs.\n<br> All of this was painted and heavily waxoyled. (And never gone out on salty roads since!)\n<br> \n<br> Front seats recovered (black vinyl, but somehow the photo shows red areas, (don't know why)\n<br> \n<br> Most of the brake cylinders have been replaced, which is when I found out that this vehicle has been fitted with an earlier front beam - and the brake cylinders are far more expensive! New brake shoes all round.\n<br> \n<br> Engine starts/runs ok, but has oil leaks. When we got the vehicle, the engine was rather poorly, but after a lot of tlc (new plugs/leads/points/oil changes etc) and a dose of Slick 50 (excellent stuff), will quite happily cruise at 50-55. After a long run and hot, the oil pressure light sometimes flickers a little at idle, just for a moment.\n<br> \n<br> Ignition upgrade - this isn't a full CD system, but takes the electrical load off the contact breaker and stops burning/pitting.\n<br> (Highly recommended for those that want to improve the ignition, without the expense of CD - kit available from Maplin for around £10\n<br> I have the same upgrade on my old Mini - very worthwhile)\n<br> \n<br> New vaccuum advance distributor - much better than the Bosch 009 that it had originally - see the thread here:\n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.ssvc.org.uk/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=44447&amp;start=0\" class=\"postlink\">viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=44447&amp;start=0</a>\n<br> \n<br> New fuel pump. Carb overhauled.\n<br> \n<br> New exhaust and tailpipe fitted for the MOT a couple of months back.\n<br> Tyres are ok (spare unused), although the 2 rear tyres tend to deflate slowly (need topping up every 2-3 weeks)\n<br> Sony CD/Radio - not sure if this is working now, we don't bother - although it has 2 huge speakers in the rear bench seat.\n<br> Most of the locks do not work\n<br> Awning\n<br> Metallised cover for vehicle\n<br> \n<br> Main rusty areas:\n<br> In some of the photos you will notice grey duct tape - this is to try and keep the rain off rusty areas.\n<br> The front window frames, along with the 2 rear lower quarters around the tail lights.\n<br> This has allowed the rain into the dashboard/parcel shelf\n<br> Bodywork around the bottom of the 2 front doors.\n<br> Down the side of the cargo door and around the rear hatch.\n<br> Front door pillars (not sure of correct name for these)\n<br> Along the bottom of the tailgate\n<br> Internal air vent",
