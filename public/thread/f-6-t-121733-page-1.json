    "content" : "Hi just bought a 67 split from Gnarly and on the way home to Glasgow the spark plug blew out from overheating after about 200 miles. Contacted RH Insurance (ERS) and they were brilliant and got me home O(after a 3hr wait on the M74 verge.....very cold at night).\n<br> \n<br> Anyway back to the point, the engine is a 1776 with dual 34's and a tuckaway exhaust and oilcooler (engine was bought from Smiffy210), and was fairly new done 2000 miles since bought. ....the sparkplug blew has traces of aluminium on it. Looking at the back of the van the cylinder is the nearest one on the left side(Passenger side) ..is the engine gubbed is there a fix?\n<br> \n<br> Where are the good VW air-cooled garages or nmechanics in the Glasgow / Paisley area.\n<br> \n<br> Looks like I am not going to the meet next week in May then ;-( ....was looking forward to it)\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Cheers\n<br> \n<br> VWMO......
