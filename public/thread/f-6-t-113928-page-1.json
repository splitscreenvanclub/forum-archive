    "content" : "Undo straps, take off cap and it should pull through. Might be worth changing the spout rubber for a new one, which means you can slice the old one which will aid removal.\n<br> \n<br> Also worth popping some duct tape over the end as it's liable to damage some paintwork on the way out and back in.\n<br> \n<br> When refurbing the old one get one of vwaircooledworks' tank sealant kits and renew all fuel hoses. See the vwaircooledworks website for what you need.\n<br> \n<br> You will of course need to undo the fuel outlet at the bottom of the tank so renew the in tank filter and sender gasket etc.",

If you have one in good order then you may be able to to reuse it, your call.\n<br> \n<br> Steve",
