Lucky boy!\n<br> One minute he's a baby, sitting in his car seat pulling the rubbers outa my pop outs,next he's entertaining the crowd. Where does the time go?\n<br> The boys want to thank everybody for making them feel appreciated on the night. They had\n<br> a total blast. Loved it. It was nice to see the new mag editor and his mrs getting down to the stone roses track.\n<br> It was a big decision on the committee's part to book them as there were very little sound/vid clips\n<br> of them available though one member had seen them play before.They do have a couple of songs on soundcloud and the lead singer,Josh Beer,also has a presence there. Personally,I'm staggered by the music they choose to play. Every one a classic in my eyes and I'm glad they came through.\n<br> The Underground are my son,Joe,on drums.Josh Beer on vocals and guitar.Jacob Houghton on guitar\n<br> and backing vocals and Jaimie Mills plays bass guitar.\n<br> In September, Joe and Josh are off to BIMM Brighton,a music academy backed by EMI records.It has recently gave us George Ezra,James Bay and the kooks to name but a few.\n<br> Exciting times indeed for the boys!\n<br> \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\">",
