On a LHD it would be quite simple and if you haven't done a dual circuit conversion either its even better becasue the servo kit includes the adapter plate to mount the bay master cylinder.

    "content" : "I too need some advice. We all like the challenge of fixing our busses, but my latest grip does not fit well with my curent, new baby, no job situation.\n<br>\n<br>Read: total melt down.\n<br>\n<br>My plan early this year was to fit my newly restored 944 disks upfront with a dual circuit system. I brought the CSP Dual C kit from one of my fav traders to ease the parts search at this time. I'm down where I keep my Bus (200miles away from home) trying to prepare it for an MOT. I decided after a remote fit of the disks that I would like a narrow beam to do the disks justice and keep the track narrow. \n<br>\n<br>So for now I've gone back to drums all round. Just for the summer.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"color: #FF0000\">My question</span>: I have fitted the Dual C just as described in the instructions (front holes feed back brakes and switch, back holes feed front).\n<br>\n<br>It all seemed to fit up nicely and unlike this artical \n<!-- m -->\n<a class=\"postlink\" href=\"http://topsoilproject.com/How%20To%20CSP%20Dual%20Circuit%20Master%20Cylinder.pdf\">http://topsoilproject.com/How%20To%20CS ... linder.pdf</a>\n<!-- m --> I did not need to adjust the rod I had to make it 1mm off touching the cylinder. I just nipped it up with a spanner.\n<br>\n<br>As I had new slaves in store I fitted them up front too. All the work so far was as I have done many times before (had the bus 16 years) and it was all straight forward. I gave the bus a full bleed and saw air out of the nipples as would be expected after changing the Master C. But on the final depression of the pedal, when I would normally lock out the bleed nipple and the pedal would go firm. No firmness?\n<br>\n<br>In fact after two full bleeding sessions now, the pedal still has no biting point. It's on the drive and the pedals will go to carpet with a funny spongey soft 'no fight' feeling. So I now have all four wheel off the ground. The drums are all adjusted up and when the pedal is depress they all lock up? This tends to happen at 80% of the full pedal travel (close to the carpet). Before on a single C my bit point was at about 20% in to depression (depression you say... tell me about it?????).\n<br>\n<br>So yes I have no idea. Faulty master cylinder. Here are the numbers on the side? 334/07 CR2 or VFCC 0007-8\n<br>\n<br>It's Sat afternoon, MOT is Monday at 3, then its 200 miles home and more nappies and job hunting. It wold be great to have the bus back on the road and out of my mind.\n<br>\n<br>Any help please?",
