    "content" : "Hi,\n<br>\n<br>I'm currently in the process of restoring/preserving an SO42, I'm after some information regarding the specification of the interior materials.\n<br>\n<br>The cargo door cards are shot, (i've managed to save even the worst de-laminated bits but these are rotten) so I need some new material for those, is a modern equivalent just 6mm birch ply?\n<br>\n<br>The veneer on the underside of the small and large tables is also delimitated and rotten around the edges. What is the modern equivalent to these strips? I've seen it referred to as arctic birch, white birch and imported birch, so if somebody have sourced some in the UK and could pass on the details that would be great.\n<br>\n<br>The front door cards and kick panels had been long removed before my ownership, when searching I have come across people saying that they had the standard grey vinyl covered items and others have said that they have birch items. So which of the two should it be? If it is birch, again would it just be normal birch ply or would it be a ply with the birch veneer strips applied?\n<br>\n<br>And finally, just out of interest, what is the veneer used on the rear side panels, it's strips rather than a birch ply in my van but the grain looks to be a different cut almost like a 1/4 sawn veneer?\n<br>\n<br>Cheers in advance, I'll post some pictures of the bus up when I get around to sorting some out.",

Also the grain pattern changes, hence the question about if some (like the rear side panels) are 1/4 sawn/cut veneer. All of which is irrelevant if I can't even find baltic birch veneer!\n<br>\n<br>Cheers.",
