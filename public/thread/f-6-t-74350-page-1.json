    "content" : "Ok\n<br>This is what we know as fact.\n<br>- I am a dummer .............. FACT\n<br>- I have cocked up my wiring.\n<br>- What was working fine is now not working fine. \n<br>- I have blown 10+ fuses in an attempt to fix my wiring. \n<br>- My attempts to fix it so far have mainly consisted of just putting another fuse in the fuse box. Hence 10+ plus fuses blown. \n<br>- I disconnected my speedo and fuel gauge to respray my dash. \n<br>-Didn't touch any wires on the fuse box. HONEST\n<br>\n<br>Facts that may help a little more\n<br>\n<br>- Peter Good loom. Top notch LHD\n<br>- Im sure I've connected up speedo and fuel gauge correctly( I drew a diagram of wires)\n<br>- I may have messed with the light switch but honestly can't remember but thought I'd left it alone. Ya I know. DONKEY\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The Problem\n<br>- Turn on lights and no lights on the right hand side. \n<br>- Bulbs ok in light.\n<br>- Turn on lights and fuel sender goes all the way over. \n<br>-Turn on ignition and blow a fuse.(second one in from the right)\n<br>- Main beam flash don't work. \n<br>- Engine starts up.\n<br>- No indicators \n<br>\n<br>- I'VE NO IDEA \n<br>\n<br>Is it the light switch I may have moved wires on. \n<br>\n<br>Answers on a postcard or post\n<br>\n<br>And o ya top weekend to have a problem as everyone at Volksword Show.\n<br>\n<br>Desperate to get it back on the road as I've planned camping weekend at Whitby over the Royal Wedding weekend. \n<br>\n<br>Cheers me dears in advance. \n<br>\n<br>Xxxxxxxx",
