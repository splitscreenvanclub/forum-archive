    "content" : "Might sound a bit brutal, but I start with 120 grit paper in my small 50mm Orbital sander. I take any of the scratches and deep marks out, I then use wet and dry, starting at 150 down to 2000 grit. After that I have two polishing wheels on my bench grinder, one I use the white compound on and the other I just use for final polish, but to be honest that's not needed as once you use the one with compound it comes up like new, \n<br>\n<br>Sounds like a lot of work, but only takes about a hour and half to do one, main thing is to get all the marks out at first stage with sander. I've included a couple of pics, but the problem I had is my bench grinder wasn't powerful enough, but I've since bought another one different to the photo and works much better",
