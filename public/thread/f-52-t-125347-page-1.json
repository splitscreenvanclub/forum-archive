    "content" : "MST Serpentine kit for sale in Black. I think the style is 'The Matador' This has been taken off my 2276. I'm not a fan of them personally but I know some like them. It's in pretty good order and comes with a new Gates belt which has only done about 50 miles. I ought to add also that I removed the idler bearing that came with the kit originally and replaced it with a new high quality bearing so there ought to be no problems with that. Included is crank pulley and chromoly bolt, alternator pulley and nut, idler bearing and bracket, ribbed belt. These kits cost around £200 new so I'm looking for around £85 (negotiable) plus postage.",
