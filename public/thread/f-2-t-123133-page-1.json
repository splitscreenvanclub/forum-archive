    "content" : "Hi All.\n<br> \n<br> I wanted to share with you all our little journey that we are about to embark on in our 1959 bus. \n<br> \n<br> We're an English and Uruguayan couple who are old enough to know better and we're travelling from England to Uruguay via Colombia, Ecuador etc. etc. Our original estimate was that we'd cover 9000KM and that it'd take 6 months. However, that is growing as we further plan our route and I reckon that we'll probably top 10,000KM by the time we arrive in Montevideo. How long that takes is anybody's guess.\n<br> \n<br> If you're interested and you'd like to be updated on our travels, you can visit and even subscribe to \n<a href=\"www.mundo-kombi.com\" class=\"postlink\">www.mundo-kombi.com</a>. There's not much to report at the moment since the Bus is currently crossing the Atlantic and we'll hopefully be reunited with it in Cartagena, Colombia in mid-April. This is when the journey really starts.\n<br> \n<br> There's no denying that I'm an aircooled geek. My first car was a '73 1303S and I've had this Bus for about 11 years which I totally rebuilt myself. It's been a massive learning process and I've broken more things than I care to remember, but I wouldn't have it any other way. What I'm trying to say is that although our web site and blog posts will be travel inspired, I'm going to make sure that there's enough \"aircooled geek\" content to satisfy the curiosity of like minded petrolheads. I expect to be carrying out a few roadside repairs and I'd be naive to think otherwise.\n<br> \n<br> I'd also like to use this opportunity to thank \n<a href=\"https://www.machine7.com/\" class=\"postlink\">Machine 7</a> for their support. We're taking some spares with us and their advice and support has been invaluable.\n<br> \n<br> Finally, the youth of today tell me that there's something called Instagram and that we should have a page or two there. So we have and you'll find us under the name mundo_kombi_com\n<br> \n<br> I'll no doubt be returning to this site frequently, especially to visit the Technical forum as and when things on the Bus start breaking \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\"> \n<br> \n<br> Wish us luck!!! ¡Hasta Luego!\n<br> \n<br> Sole y Eliot.",

    "content" : "Good Morning, Guys. \n<br> \n<br> Apologies for the lack of response on my part. It's been a stressful couple of weeks and Scotty, we're in touch via Instagram.\n<br> \n<br> We've now arrived in Medellín, Pablo Escobar country. We did a 5 month recky in Colombia last year so we're pretty familiar with the place. Probably the warmest people that I have met, but they have some odd tendencies. But this is classic car heaven - massive old V8s and VW Bugs (Escarabajos) are ten a penny, and fuel is 50p per litre. This is mind kinda place. Roads are generally .... though, though no worse than Oxfordshire and less congested \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":-D\" title=\"Very Happy\">\n<br> \n<br> Nothing to report on our trip yet. Last night the ship was docked at Tangier and is now on it's way to Guadalupe, it's due to arrive there on the 12th. What we hadn't realised was that from Southampton the Bus would sit at La Havre for two weeks. If I had known that, I would have booked it from there and driven down.\n<br> \n<br> Thanks to everyone reading this and for looking us up. I'll do my best to keep some good content flowing once the Bus arrives in Cartagena, Colombia.\n<br> \n<br> Chao.\n<br> \n<br> Eliot and Sole.\n<br> \n<br> \n<a href=\"http://www.mundo-kombi.com\" class=\"postlink\">www.mundo-kombi.com</a>\n<br> @mundo_kombi_com",
