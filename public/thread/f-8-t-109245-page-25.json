So far no I haven't had any issues at all. With time the fulcrum plates will get chewed up and will need replacing. Ive done over 8000 miles in it and haven't had any issues at all so far. The box isn't raised no. That being Said the cradle is in a slight different position on an early bus so its not quite as an acute angle. Your bus looks very similar height to mine in my opinion!",
