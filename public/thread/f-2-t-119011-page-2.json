Very sad. Hopefully he was able to comfort or compensate the owner of it somehow. \n </div>\n</blockquote> Sadly, that's not quite correct. I didn't lend the bowl to Alex, He 'borrowed' it from Ady before I picked up the bus. Alex sent it to India in nothing more than a flimsy cardboard box only slightly bigger than the bowl and 'packed' in a few sheets of newspaper. It arrived in India already smashed and the company sent me the correspondence to prove it. They were asking Alex what he wanted to do about it so he knew for sure that it did not arrive in one piece. He lied directly to me many times over and the stories of divorce/illness/and a shed load of other .... went on and on. It arrived back to me after many many attempts to retrieve it about a year or so later... in the same crappy cardboard box and the rest as they say, is history. \n<br> \n<br> Your story is a familiar one and I went through the same crap. He dropped off the grid when I tried to get him to return the bowl. The only way I got it back was tracking it down to the company in India and explaining the situation. They were very gracious and went on to explain that Alex owed them several thousand dollars for tooling, setup and parts they made for him... which he had probably already sold on to the rest of us. As I understand it, they never did get paid what he owed them, I may be wrong but Alex lied and gave so many excuses over time that I have no reason to believe he would ever do the right thing.\n<br> \n<br> I'd had a few issues getting parts from him for a couple of years before that and thought he might just be a bit unorganised and just over promised on orders etc. However, after posting the Mauser bowl saga, I had PMs and emails from many people all,over the world who shared horror stories of dealing with him. He is simply a con man and a thief and a liar. I wouldn't ever deal with him again and cannot understand how he is not in prison. Or maybe he finally is and that's why you can't get hold of him? \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" alt=\":D\" title=\"Big Grin\"> \n<br> \n<br> I wish you the best of luck!
