    "content" : "First the good news, with the lifting of restrictions on campsites we are able to go ahead with the AGM at Victoria Farm in August.\n<br> Those restrictions that are still in place will limit the weekend in some respects, but if you want a chilled camping weekend meeting up with old friends and making new ones, then we still have the makings of a great weekend.\n<br> To comply with social distancing, everything will be outside. Good job it's August. We will still have the coffee morning, Van of the Year and other prizes, charity auction, Eddy's bar will also be open. A limited food menu will be available for takeaway from the Farmhouse, there will be no marquee on the lawn.\n<br> There will be some seedlings activities, but obviously with the infection risk the go-karts and bouncy castle are on hold till next year.\n<br> We have yet to hear from Stanford Hall, but we will still go ahead even if they cancel. If they do then Rikki has plans for a cruise at some point over the weekend.\n<br> I'm sure you all understand the current and ever changing guidelines have forced us to limit this years event, but for those of you that hanker for a simple camping weekend with loads of other splits and like minded people then this will be the weekend for you. Just remember to bring the baby wipes...",

Hopefully as a much smaller event with the ability to comply with social distancing, we will still be able to go ahead.\n<br> Rikki had plans for a convoy, I'd like to try something along the lines of the old BVF Rundfahrt..who remembers that? It's German for 'round trip' for those that are wondering..",

The safety and well being of all our members has to be paramount, we still hope to go ahead but this restriction will need to be eased first.",
