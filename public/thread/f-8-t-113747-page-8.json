I'm now thinking it's something to do with gear selector , can 4th not engaging properly cause it it whine / grumble ? Or maybe the hockey stick has an issue as I swapped this between boxes . Will be happy but gutted if it is just selector ! \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk",

I have had to resend the reg docs back to DVLA as I made a mistake on the form grr. in the meantime I have fitted a servo and the brakes are massively improved ! I haven't driven it on the road since but from what I can tell I don't think I will be fitting disk brakes ever again, my other bus has CSP disks and then I added the servo later, it seems the servo is all that is really required as the thing stops like you wouldn't believe now on the standard drums. Just got to tidy up the brake pipes and add a few fixings and hopefully the reg number will be here .. I am itching to get out in it now, fingers crossed for the weekend.",

You should try reduction boxes and a big nut trans. In my opinion it's a nicer torquey drive so long as speed isn't your thing..I don't really change out of fourth unless it's a really steep hill!",
