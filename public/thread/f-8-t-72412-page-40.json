    "content" : "Fitted front pedestal mats yesterday. I managed to get the cuts pretty darn good, but just couldn't get them to sit nicely on the part which curves. They're good enough though.\n<br>\n<br>What is a balls ache is that the monkeydub seals I bought wouldnt fit with the mat tucked in towards the bottom. I suspect it's as much to do with the fact the arches and pedestals have been replaced. In the end I resorted to trimming about 6 inches, rather than tucking it in. Again, not perfect but ok for now. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>\n<br>Of course, the doors don't shut now that the seals are fitted. I was hoping that using the silicon seals would avoid this issue, but no such luck. Looks like all the doors will need adjusting with the seals fitted. Pictures this evening. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" alt=\":roll:\" title=\"Roll Eyes\"> \n<br>\n<br>Next job is to vacuum out the front cab area, test fit the floor mat. Check the correct position for the dip switch and fit it. I could do with fitting the shifter base as well, but it's a 2 man job , as someone needs to be under th bus to hold the linkage plate in position.\n<br>\n<br>Then it's the horrendous job of trimming the walk through area. GULP. \n<img src=\"./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif\" alt=\"8O\" title=\"eek\">",

I only fitted the bit that goes up the B-post and along the top and then down the A-post .... ( one complete rubber by memory ) the rubber at the bottom just was never going to work and as its not needed to keep the bus water tight so I felt it off ..... and you know how nice my doors close \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>cheers \n<br>\n<br>Mark",
