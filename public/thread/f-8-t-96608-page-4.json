    "content" : "<span class=\"fadeEffect\"></span>Jimmy's farm was going to be the furthest Seabiscuit will of travelled so with this 400 mile round trip I made sure everything was good on the unknown 1500sp eBay purchase, it had already done less than 200 miles since new plugs, leads , oil change and tappet adjustment so I was not concerned about these, checked oil level, belt was a bit frayed so changed that.\n<br>So a 9 o clock start from home, travelled 40 miles at 50mph, stopped at the services to check all was good which it was.\n<br>Hit the M1, off on the A14, thought I will stop at Cambridge services but I remembered how busy it was so travelled a bit further and dam! I could smell rubber and the alternator light was on so off on the slip road and stop \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif\" alt=\":?\" title=\"Confused\"> \n<br>Opened the engine lid and my new belt had snapped, bummer!!\n<br>Lucky I had a spare with me so slipped it on, fired the engine up and walked around the back, the belt had flipped in the top pulley but was running twisted and was running right in the bottom pulley, so engine off and put the belt right again, repeat the start up again but the belt did the same. So to cut a long story short I wasn't going to risk the remaining drive to Ipswich so made use of the AA to finish the journey!!\n<br>\n<br>So on arrival at Alive and Vdubbin me and some mates (after cracking a beer open)proceeded to diagnose the problem, the Mr Smith aka the VW guru wanders up, takes one look and says \"you got the wrong top pulley on that youth\"\n<br>So diagnosis complete, I had a dynamo pulley on my alternator \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif\" alt=\":oops:\" title=\"Red Face\">\n<br>Turns out the belt was sitting low in the top pulley and high in the bottom causing the flipping. \n<br>So another mate takes a visit to GSF in Ipswich, one new pulley and a belt, we found a genuine crank pulley in the autojumble, so proceeded to change everything on the Saturday but hit a problem, could we get the crank pulley off? Not a chance! Levers, bars, bit of tapping, no chance, we needed a puller.\n<br>The pulley was one of the cheap tin one's and with all the push/pulling was now distorted and damaged beyond use so had to come off.\n<br>After a wander around begging anyone for a puller which no one had we had to call on another mate's help, he wasn't coming until the Sunday but had one!\n<br>It got fixed on the Sunday morning and I drove the 4 hour trip back without a hitch except for a concerned ear and checking the battery light every 5 seconds!\n<br>The McDonald's stop midway was certainly enjoyed especially the interested lady who came across asking me all about Seabiscuit \n<img class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif\" alt=\"8)\" title=\"Cool\"> \n<br>Laters taters.",
