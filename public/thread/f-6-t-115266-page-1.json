Mine have been in the shed for years, finally fitted them over winter, they are repro could be Gsf or heritage, anyhoo, in the fitting kit was a sprung washer thing but trimmed to almost 3 points, the cap should go over that. Mine didn't ,it's sat on a shelf after being sworn at, I drilled the spindle/pivot and put a pin through it to stop it coming off. The small Spring is also on the shelf as it didn't fit anywhere. I can only assume it's a universal fitting kit resulting in spares as my heat goes on and off ok. \n<img src=\"//uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20160329/be664cf06de5b06db272208d21b23903.jpg\" class=\"postimage\" alt=\"Image\">\n<br> \n<br> \n<br> Sent from my sofa.",
